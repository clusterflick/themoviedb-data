The music in Night and Day by Gianni Castaglioni is in the repetitive rhythm of the images, usually very rapid (with some suddenly slowed down, figements, yet with a fiery intensity). And as each shot, (brief like those of Mekas or Brakhage), moves,; as the camera moves to the nervous rhythm of a wrist, the music becomes a sort of Free Jazz — and not only visually, since the soundtrack is composed of piano frenzies à la Elton John. The extreme close-ups that sprinkle this sort of intimate journal and which are among the most admirable - as well as the most rapid - ever made in cinema, don’t float adrift like the film’s music through a hundred flowing veins.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/cSXtbLbyT4PknF9W0Bymb7Jv8Xu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1976-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night 'n' Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"La Notte et il Giorno","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"La nuit et le jour","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1970506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrizia Vicinelli","original_name":"Patrizia Vicinelli","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/7rYjbixTbE2BCvGmZrQoc2XSb61.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64373f8f9ac535007877fcb4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2207072,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gianni Castagnoli","original_name":"Gianni Castagnoli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2d78850e0a2609ed38bc88","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1355116,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alvin Curran","original_name":"Alvin Curran","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8a6f4ceb79c200370a407a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/xhq0CmMepDrevoJfhQV9WBJTQ0p.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/x9uUDMyMhCTDuHKaXodrGUpLFzp.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/rX5vkOX3nBGog0u403ApYq5aLCX.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cSXtbLbyT4PknF9W0Bymb7Jv8Xu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Festival de La Rochelle","release_date":"1976-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"RAI3 (Fuori Orario), restoration","release_date":"2024-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Gianni Castagnol, Notte e il Giorno (Excerpt)","key":"86904502","site":"Vimeo","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2014-02-17T15:36:36.000Z","id":"5cd3c0b89251416ec1249f5b"}]}}}
