The clerk, Gerard Dutillard, funnels bank funds into three fictional affiliates in a way that makes the bank's president, Jean-Francois de Roquemorel, legally responsible. Financial ruin seems a distinct possibility, but Dutillard has worked out a plan to make the system work in his favor, and soon enough his banking superiors are doing their best to salvage his film and make it marketable, prompting actual investors to fuel the production with cash.","popularity":0.1603,"poster_path":"/hp7LrM99n7wUj7zfnWoYJwHaSgr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Head for Business","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Féodor Atkine","original_name":"Féodor Atkine","popularity":0.3421,"profile_path":"/qCpSPJyM7v9p3fGBJV8ZqGETBr0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jean-François de Roquemaurel","credit_id":"5f06fd6b55bc3500341d69fb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Keim","original_name":"Claire Keim","popularity":0.2639,"profile_path":"/bhqqJPx08TlVan569Oz4qpeWn7z.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Laetitia Zoët","credit_id":"5f06fd4e1f98d100381651cd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Delpy","original_name":"Albert Delpy","popularity":0.1923,"profile_path":"/8j9s2hCN0IEdr7QCeHoxo5cbHTf.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Edouard","credit_id":"5f06fdd81d1bf40038656ad9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"François Levantal","original_name":"François Levantal","popularity":0.2792,"profile_path":"/gKZUbm7NIQbAOQmncBIegE6VOcf.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Etienne Bac","credit_id":"5f06fda393db920034462244","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2203035,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guy-Philippe Bertin","original_name":"Guy-Philippe Bertin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Dutillard","credit_id":"5f06fe885e12000038e5ad78","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2203035,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guy-Philippe Bertin","original_name":"Guy-Philippe Bertin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2e60a2c3a3682915a5bc20","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0250069","wikidata_id":"Q3227088","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2OLMMoS6eNBBB5jnk2dq311aplI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/hp7LrM99n7wUj7zfnWoYJwHaSgr.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":666},{"aspect_ratio":0.744,"height":1023,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/blKsh3dLrkGH41HMHzZp2QXXtvv.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":761}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
