Since Rachel suffers from severe bi-polar disorder that has to be controlled by lithium, she can't risk getting pregnant. But because of her mental health history, they are bad candidates for adoption. Finally Rachel gives up on the system, and does things her own way...she goes off her drugs and gets pregnant. The ensuing nine months get worse and worse for the young woman, as there are legal battles to end her pregnancy in order to force her back on the drug.","popularity":1.2318,"poster_path":"/fXuAP0SQz1msw53e9DysPtdVirk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3976,"logo_path":null,"name":"Carroll Newman
