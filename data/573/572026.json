Don Dino's church is always empty. In fact, the town's faithful frequent the new church, run by Don Gabriele, a pimp priest who knows how to deal with people. Donato's arrival initially seems like the final blow for Don Dino's church: Donato doesn't know where to start a mass, he has never confessed or married anyone, the mere idea of ​​performing an extreme unction scares him. Don Dino begins to argue with Donato: he seems anything but a priest. But little by little, Don Donato's extravagant ways, his open-mindedness as a \"sinner\", his mentality as a rock priest, begin to attract the faithful.","popularity":0.3709,"poster_path":"/t1Vz5W94Hc6Mbu1jADrWPY5Tg9T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":176136,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sunshine
