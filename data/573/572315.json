When he arrives at his new school, he stumbles onto a classmate being bullied. His intervention triggers two new friendships — one with the victim Scott and the other with Elizabeth — the classmate who aids him after he is knocked out. Scott has a worse problem than the bullies — he has not come out at home yet. But Elizabeth may have an even bigger problem: she is a social pariah because she keeps acting as though someone or something is after her. Meanwhile, Akira’s home front situation is going from bad to worse.","popularity":0.4039,"poster_path":"/7pRrWHyIZxP0glOQxwNATuRb9fr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sometimes what has passed . . . is not past.","title":"Another Yesterday","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2621307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kento Matsunami","original_name":"Kento Matsunami","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/cUFJ0jlyfTkfhMFqDndopIVleIO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Akira Oniwa","credit_id":"6153a8f7ad87f700856dc04b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3251548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucía Rodriguez-Nelson","original_name":"Lucía Rodriguez-Nelson","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Elizabeth Ayers","credit_id":"6153a918158c85004258e807","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2824887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Chengary","original_name":"Billy Chengary","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/zIWp2efUBJ2Bbz5Ldsa80ZGif68.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Scott Dahse","credit_id":"6153a93ffe6c180062a8454a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1973954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naoyuki Ikeda","original_name":"Naoyuki Ikeda","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/7mIxFfHSZfsIQGeBa2uSrrzxxuB.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Takashi Oniwa","credit_id":"6153a972158c85002c5309e4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":239955,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akiko Shima","original_name":"Akiko Shima","popularity":0.1064,"profile_path":"/pId0d4WqqsCu9NWcppS3UXVI0ew.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Hiroko Oniwa","credit_id":"6153a999e329430043066170","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3251551,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalie Duch","original_name":"Natalie Duch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Bryony Ellery","credit_id":"6153a9c2fe6c180062a84628","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2209608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Heil","original_name":"Steven Heil","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6153a81f9974ee002624fb87","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2209608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Heil","original_name":"Steven Heil","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c31a4cd0e0a2611b83d8c5e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6149564","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7pRrWHyIZxP0glOQxwNATuRb9fr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6270,"name":"high school"},{"id":2024,"name":"wisconsin"},{"id":162846,"name":"ghost"},{"id":190101,"name":"new student"},{"id":246256,"name":"oshkosh"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
