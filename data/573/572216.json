Rebellious 24-year-old Anne Bruneau is abandoned at the altar by her fiancé Yann. Unaware that Yann was drunk and fell down a well, Anne reacts to his absence by cutting her hair, dressing like a man, and signing on with a ship captained by a dwarf. When Yann learns what happened, he begins running south to Marseilles to rejoin her. Aboard the ship, Anne's disguise is discovered by the captain and the ship's doctor. With an Arab, she jumps ship, hiding with hookers in Marseilles while still maintaining her disguise.","popularity":0.2375,"poster_path":"/6uRFfbmTYCWqbfR0zwzgukYT949.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le monde à l'envers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denis Lavant","original_name":"Denis Lavant","popularity":0.2932,"profile_path":"/WgGsHm3IC6ocjmjslREvKKNnX3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Yann Kerebel","credit_id":"6023d748dd2589003fbc151b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1283304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Capretti","original_name":"Sara Capretti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Magali","credit_id":"6023d7560e597b003ca84384","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roschdy Zem","original_name":"Roschdy Zem","popularity":0.5493,"profile_path":"/9SUbcnRYvp1Bs1pyiaVK4GWuZgT.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Nasser","credit_id":"6023d76a0e597b003fa82e63","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":24558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurence Côte","original_name":"Laurence Côte","popularity":0.2029,"profile_path":"/9Ze7vTkIm2X5TU48itFgRj4HWFO.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Anne Bruneau","credit_id":"60bb843ac8f8580058b27633","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1578562,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jean Jourdheuil","original_name":"Jean Jourdheuil","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bb84575b1240002c16dc67","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1495608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gianluigi Toccafondo","original_name":"Gianluigi Toccafondo","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":"/7TkuAJhHlCwEIYoirnly3WdcZfg.jpg","credit_id":"60bb846a9a9e20006d5b7c59","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1014561,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rolando Colla","original_name":"Rolando Colla","popularity":0.057,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bb84515b124000436a4334","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2026113,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elena Pedrazzoli","original_name":"Elena Pedrazzoli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bb845d9a9e2000406df619","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3114913,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hansjörg Schertenleib","original_name":"Hansjörg Schertenleib","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60bb84647f2d4a0057233a27","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1014561,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rolando Colla","original_name":"Rolando Colla","popularity":0.057,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2c76abc3a368290ba28286","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2026113,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elena Pedrazzoli","original_name":"Elena Pedrazzoli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6023d689ef9d7263bd5591d2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0166714","wikidata_id":"Q4004470","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.687,"height":770,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6uRFfbmTYCWqbfR0zwzgukYT949.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":529}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-08-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
