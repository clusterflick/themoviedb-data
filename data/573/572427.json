The house is historic and apparently haunted; at least, Sarah is disturbed during the night by a woman's crying but initially supposes someone else has double-booked. But next morning there is no sign of her. Tom, meanwhile, is haunted by his memories from a year before. Eventually, they both leave for an empty flat on the coast nearby, where Tom's relationship ended. Sarah begins to fall for Tom, but Tom has now - belatedly - fallen for his ex, and finally makes up for his fatal infidelity with her.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Still Falling","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2207157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jason Wilcox","original_name":"Jason Wilcox","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2da308c3a3685320a0fcc2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
