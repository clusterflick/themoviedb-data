A view of landscape is taken apart, to be reconstituted through memory. The grid, a reference to the “veil of threads” invented by Albrecht Dürer as an aid for perspective drawing – to transfer vision to a sheet of paper – is used for an opposite effect – to disperse a landscape across time. The viewer is asked to remember the space as it passes and reconstitute it from memory, actively connecting the image across space and time.","popularity":0.3028,"poster_path":"/wJQeCQyl1U2JeCJiqCSBxvkpbj5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tamalpais","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1205261,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Kennedy","original_name":"Chris Kennedy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2d93b6c3a3685320a0ec6c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1272,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wJQeCQyl1U2JeCJiqCSBxvkpbj5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":850},{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":1421,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v9va3zq0S697z53nKSydhxPtCty.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":950},{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1272,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lJOCBueBX2Sn3z0WGWXbYU14kvP.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":850}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1706,"name":"experiment"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
