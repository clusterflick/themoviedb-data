From this perspective she would espy the arrival of friends and family, contemplate the change of seasons and reflect on time past. On the shelves of this window she collected mementos of a childhood in China, life as an artist, and the travels in between. Combining images of my own travels through Japan and China with images of the home my grandparents built, Janeâ€™s Window reflects on the passing down of memory, curiosity and creativity across generations.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ArtFyAcj1exxIdwsG5HWv5U3myd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jane's Window","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1205261,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Kennedy","original_name":"Chris Kennedy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2d91139251415f3c6b917b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":766,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ArtFyAcj1exxIdwsG5HWv5U3myd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":511}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
