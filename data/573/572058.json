Though Laurie Anderson, Tania Leon, Meredith Monk and Pauline Oliveros are all pioneers in American music, each composer pursues a distinct direction of her own. Their rehearsals and performances show a common pursuit of lyrical storytelling through which a new set of contemporary narratives has been forged. Through body, sound, movement and composition, these women have forged their own path through the wild world of modern music.","popularity":0.5275,"poster_path":"/6FEsEEU2xELWAbe3VozWN5bYKCE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70445,"logo_path":null,"name":"Michael Blackwood Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sensual Nature of Sound: 4 Composers Laurie Anderson, Tania Leon, Meredith Monk, Pauline Oliveros","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":68929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurie Anderson","original_name":"Laurie Anderson","popularity":0.2461,"profile_path":"/qzYxlXRWKJSa8Qbwt4bcaaUVtle.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5e5fcb319b8616000f00c592","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2556859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tania Leon","original_name":"Tania Leon","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5e5fcb389b86160013009335","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1303053,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Meredith Monk","original_name":"Meredith Monk","popularity":0.265,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5e5fcb42357c0000112fa3e6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1114485,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pauline Oliveros","original_name":"Pauline Oliveros","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5e5fcb4e357c0000112fa3f0","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":20035,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yoav Kosh","original_name":"Yoav Kosh","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645518fac044290143e44133","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2556864,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Helmut Rathke","original_name":"Helmut Rathke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6455190087a27a00e390545b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1731147,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Trottenberg","original_name":"Mark Trottenberg","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64551906d8f44e0dae96e30d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2556863,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mathias Maas","original_name":"Mathias Maas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6455190d87a27a00fe73406d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":982870,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mead Hunt","original_name":"Mead Hunt","popularity":0.0814,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64551913d8f44e0db0727621","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2556860,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Roger Grainger","original_name":"Roger Grainger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6455191a33ad8f01728ebe77","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1999588,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Simon Kleebauer","original_name":"Simon Kleebauer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64551920d8f44e0db0727625","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3089590,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yvonne Miklosh","original_name":"Yvonne Miklosh","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6455192887a27a00fe734075","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3009607,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Julie Sloane","original_name":"Julie Sloane","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648f484d559d22011c4cebc1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1264965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Blackwood","original_name":"Michael Blackwood","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":"/8R0NnxYVOuWqX5PvIvA0vmmLqh5.jpg","credit_id":"5e5fcb65303c8500193edfa9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1853719","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6FEsEEU2xELWAbe3VozWN5bYKCE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
