We do not talk about immigration on her Obama phone. For that we use the other number with no data plan.” The linear train ride moving from Los Angeles to New York diverges into unruly directions of consciousness. A multiplicity of voices share thoughts, dreams and histories evoking images far away from the enclosed spaces of this trains interior. While capturing these landscapes and interiors through his lens, the moving images evidently illustrate an undocumented subjectivity, a site of precarious movement, migration and fugitivism in the US.","popularity":0.0882,"poster_path":"/xX2kjDrFdsPOkgpIuxPt2mCr7Hl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Data Plan","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"노 데이터 플랜","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1357550,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miko Revereza","original_name":"Miko Revereza","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c30b09992514122ac7391df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1357550,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miko Revereza","original_name":"Miko Revereza","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c4b0fa7c3a368478c8d5b3d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1357550,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miko Revereza","original_name":"Miko Revereza","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6ebd820e0a261777a3b784","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1357550,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miko Revereza","original_name":"Miko Revereza","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6ebd88925141133efb84d8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10487736","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vcDs52Rd4fE8qnblhOovfLPgVXT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/raMN6ceU8Xbo8sAqF9ljetY0FmG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xX2kjDrFdsPOkgpIuxPt2mCr7Hl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DMZ International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2020-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"IFFR","release_date":"2019-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"No Data Plan - Trailer | IFFR 2019","key":"8lXUP3dh69c","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","published_at":"2019-01-15T20:49:39.000Z","official":false,"id":"5c407397c3a368694e4198c3"}]}}}
