But she’s not the marrying kind – at least not until now. However, their dreams are threatened by both a merciless society that condemns Violetta’s racy past and an equally merciless disease. Russian soprano Venera Gimadieva portrays the iconic role of Violetta, alongside American tenor Michael Fabiano as Alfredo. The visual beauty of Tom Cairns’s opulent production aptly echoes the irresistible allure of this beloved opera.","popularity":0.1634,"poster_path":"/tPtXOat96Knle8WI1e2rX6edCyM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36795,"logo_path":null,"name":"Glyndebourne Festival
