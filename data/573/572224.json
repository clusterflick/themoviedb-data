With the bicentennial of the burning of Wild Goose Lodge and the centennial of Michael Collins and the Rising upcoming, this historical feature is rich in Irish culture and explanation of some interesting history. Shot entirely in Ireland, the production value and cinematography on this film is truly award winning. Logline: The Lynch Family try to defend themselves against the British and their own Irish heritage when their home is broken into by local villagers and a report of the break in leads to the hanging of the culprits by the British magistrate, much to the surprise of the Lynch family and the local Irish neighbors. The local Ribbonmen vow revenge again Lynch, while the town priest tries to maintain peace within the village.","popularity":0.0896,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":112935,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wildgoose Lodge Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2016-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wild Goose Lodge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":199942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Duffy","original_name":"Dave Duffy","popularity":0.1413,"profile_path":"/m95QzJZzv8NiEbxRNRhR74SV2NC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Father McCann","credit_id":"5c2c8a7d92514122ac6dff6d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2206509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Muckian","original_name":"Tom Muckian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Patrick Devane","credit_id":"5c2c8a99c3a3682913a2b81f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2206510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deirdre Rice","original_name":"Deirdre Rice","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Kate Lynch","credit_id":"5c2c8aacc3a3682919a29c87","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1872218,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naseen Morgan","original_name":"Naseen Morgan","popularity":0.0872,"profile_path":"/6I3ilxlArTYTrvPIUTKB42u4ild.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lizzy Lynch","credit_id":"5c2c8abfc3a368291fa2a06d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1227306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Rooney","original_name":"Joe Rooney","popularity":0.1453,"profile_path":"/wjwv8NrNba6SrAe8CgfEg5wHLBg.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ribbonman","credit_id":"5c2c8b0ac3a368290ba29a30","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1412881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Finbar Furey","original_name":"Finbar Furey","popularity":0.1439,"profile_path":"/8gw6bKlUARUkQZItaO8MlH843Ri.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Ribbonman","credit_id":"5c2c8b2492514122b16dfc1f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Connors","original_name":"John Connors","popularity":0.1636,"profile_path":"/f1vs11ZUh9e1aghWQZBmsJiMu25.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Ribbonman","credit_id":"6300b6483e6f2b0082b397dc","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3733762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Ward","original_name":"James Ward","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Ribbonman","credit_id":"64a0c7b40cb335011bcbaee8","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2305182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven Campbell","original_name":"Steven Campbell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Captain James Anton","credit_id":"5cce9ba20e0a2627aafed4d9","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1010738,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maurice Walsh","original_name":"Maurice Walsh","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Tom Rooney","credit_id":"5c2c8b87c3a3682915a2be4a","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2206513,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Macardle","original_name":"Paul Macardle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2c8b9b92514122b86e393c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2206514,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William P.
