Her 16th birthday is marred by bickering between her British-born mother and her hippie ersatz stepfather; moreover, her father is a drunken bartender in town. Her boredom leads her to Titi and his gang of skinheads. When their walk on the wild side goes awry, Juliette's parents react coarsely. Frustrated, Juliette ventures into the night on her scooter, resulting in a major accident that chastens the community.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/xvgOkPzz6uPe3yfsgqDgVstQI34.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'attrape-rêves","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3688349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laetitia Velay","original_name":"Laetitia Velay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6314fdd9d40d4c007ab0c253","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3688350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurent Combelles","original_name":"Laurent Combelles","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6314fde3f9475b007b28b22b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3688351,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oswald Massot","original_name":"Oswald Massot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6314fdec71083a009249a553","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3688352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sébastien Pernak","original_name":"Sébastien Pernak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6314fdf571083a007b450aa6","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":567047,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alain Ross","original_name":"Alain Ross","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2e46730e0a2655ee3d15e6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0245734","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.727,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xvgOkPzz6uPe3yfsgqDgVstQI34.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":727}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
