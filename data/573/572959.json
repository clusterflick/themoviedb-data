The man was found guilty of absconding two bars of soap and a tin of shoe polish. As a dangerous public enemy, he is sentenced to death. More than 16,000 death sentences were passed by the Special Court and the People's Court during the Nazi era. And the judges and state prosecutors who perpetrated these injustices were back on the bench after 1945.\r Peggy Parnass, a Jewish journalist and a relative of victims of Nazi injustices, experienced this continuity and described many of its ramifications in more than 10 years as a court reporter. The film follows her radical, subjective viewpoint and her incredible encounters with Nazi jurists in today's courts of law.","popularity":0.133,"poster_path":"/vavbOhkqYdprfaWkonUjg2E0dNt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72912,"logo_path":null,"name":"Axel Engstfeld Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1982-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Von Richtern und anderen Sympathisanten","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":24110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peggy Parnass","original_name":"Peggy Parnass","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":"/6buIbUsyhPYxri2yyh9cSdZY3jB.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5c30722c0e0a26630239e41c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1488013,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Axel Engstfeld","original_name":"Axel Engstfeld","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c30715bc3a3682919a8afe0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1488027,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bernd Mosblech","original_name":"Bernd Mosblech","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c3071759251416d946f4b0b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1488013,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Axel Engstfeld","original_name":"Axel Engstfeld","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c3071830e0a267eb33bdfc6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2209045,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gisela Keuerleber","original_name":"Gisela Keuerleber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c3071a7c3a3680b8ca43485","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1488013,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Axel Engstfeld","original_name":"Axel Engstfeld","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c3071b70e0a260fc13cdd79","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137534,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Klaus Schulze","original_name":"Klaus Schulze","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":"/iMJ85Zc7ehGuy5FkTt1av1VAFmA.jpg","credit_id":"5c3071c90e0a2664f339cadf","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2209046,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lijane Lübcke","original_name":"Lijane Lübcke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c3072050e0a26630239e3fe","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0295749","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":788,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vavbOhkqYdprfaWkonUjg2E0dNt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
