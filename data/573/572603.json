Some people start pulling their 8mm-cameras out of their cupboards to capture the images of the events. On the base of these extraordinary, widely unknown recordings and found footage, Claus Oppermann und Gerald Grotes first feature film tells many impressive forgotten stories about the rise of the Berlin Wall in 1961 to its fall in 1989, about the division of Germany and a bloody borderline through the middle of Europe.\r A unique documentary, put together out of hundreds of previously unreleased substandard films that have never been seen like this before. Many private archives were opened for the first time - a time travel, well worth seeing.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Up to the Border - A Personal View About the Berlin Wall","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1693601,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Claus Oppermann","original_name":"Claus Oppermann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2e81fdc3a36819bba18372","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1693602,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gerald Grote","original_name":"Gerald Grote","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2e82110e0a260fc13a1ce0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
