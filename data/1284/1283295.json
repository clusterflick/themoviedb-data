The Dutch conductor, who was appointed honorary member of the Vienna Philharmonic shortly before the concert, is joined by star pianist Emanuel Ax in Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4: a musical interaction of a depth of sentiment and an agreement in making music together that sounds wonderfully natural (Salzburger Nachrichten). The concert ends with Bruckner's monumental Symphony No. 7 with its famous second movement, which marked the composer's breakthrough and remains one of his most popular symphonies.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Farewell Concert at Salzburg Festival [Bernard Haitink & Vienna Philharmonic]","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4687153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Haitink","original_name":"Bernard Haitink","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"66326081ad59b5012b6cc17e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4687155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vienna Philharmonic","original_name":"Vienna Philharmonic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Orchestra","credit_id":"6632609983ee67012d400bfb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4687157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emanuel Ax","original_name":"Emanuel Ax","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Pianist","credit_id":"663260b2813cb601218673bf","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
