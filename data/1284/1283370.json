A florist, Tung (Ai Wai), is consumed by grief but puts on a front for others. The boy drops by at the florist and orders a custom floral arrangement - a teddy bear-shaped wreath with his favourite yellow flowers — to be readied in three days' time and paid with money saved up in his piggy bank. Tung forges an unlikely friendship with his young customer, an encounter that releases bottled-up emotions so that healing process can begin.","popularity":0.1523,"poster_path":"/h5NIE8vEQttkLDZvIlhaFONEThl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61392,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fresh Wave","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2012-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flowers with Aphasia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ai Wai","original_name":"艾威","popularity":0.5355,"profile_path":"/szSsgZ32lyI32lEvo7xYgQbo01x.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tung","credit_id":"6632723c813cb6012186785e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1561532,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wong Fei-Pang","original_name":"Wong Fei-Pang","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663272ed9590e30126ba420f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3418580,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Li Sum-Yuet","original_name":"Li Sum-Yuet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66327302470ead012510852e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3418580,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Li Sum-Yuet","original_name":"Li Sum-Yuet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663272ccfe6c1801232efc44","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1863,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h5NIE8vEQttkLDZvIlhaFONEThl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1242}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
