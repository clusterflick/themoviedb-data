Yet away from a name that showcases his self-assurance on the steep slopes of Austria, Dennis’s struggles with identity run deep. At its heart, the question of race and what it means to be black in a sport that remains predominantly and conspicuously white.  Descendance is Dennis’s story, a personal journey of self-exploration that examines his relationship with his own skin color, with those closest to him and all those who share his love of skiing.  It’s a journey that takes him from his home valley in Austria to Accra, the capital of Ghana, shining a light on the power of family along the way.","popularity":0.1149,"poster_path":"/pf2hyM88uvFqRrHvy90Zlg6LB5N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67368,"logo_path":"/6kSJE8q0wqJVjG1Cj7cSqPcaXlE.png","name":"Legs Of
