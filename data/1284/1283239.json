She came from a prominent family in Dallas. To anyone looking from the outside, she was the girl who had it all. The one you hoped to know. The one you dreamt to be. Grace was sixteen when she took her own life on November 26, 2016.  Suicide does not discriminate, and the after-effects are just as earth-shattering as the tragedy itself. This documentary seeks to spread awareness by shining a light on the loved ones left behind. It is our heartfelt hope that anyone who has lost a loved one to suicide will be inspired by this family's remarkable journey and realize that there is purpose in their pain, & the possibility of healing & happiness after suffering devastating loss. Surviving and thriving after the death of a loved one to suicide is possible.","popularity":0.0423,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Suicide does not discriminate","title":"Losing Grace Finding Hope","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4686956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sue Loncar","original_name":"Sue Loncar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66324d65af4324012553aef0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4686958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Long","original_name":"Patrick Long","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66324d70c616ac01221895e9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4686959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Long","original_name":"David Long","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66324d7bc616ac0125189ac9","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4686961,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcia Carroll","original_name":"Marcia Carroll","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66324d92470ead0125107c1d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4686962,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Andrew Redd","original_name":"Andrew Redd","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66324da8358da7012a54334b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4686963,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michael Lewis","original_name":"Michael Lewis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66324dc7dd2589012b2df517","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
