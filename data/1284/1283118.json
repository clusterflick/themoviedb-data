After suffering in a dysfunctional family for most of his life and realising its visceral impact on his mother (Madhu), he convinces her to act in a media project and tries to raise questions by masking the activity as an “actor’s exercise”. He creates a facade to heal the damage his family has faced due to the influence of societal norms and patriarchy in tandem. Shaurya’s father Naval lurks around to keep surveillance and that’s exactly what he's been set up for. Vandit & Shaurya ask Madhu to perform activities to create physical discomfort whenever she adheres to societal norms. The nature of this activity is questioned by the parents, especially Naval, as most of the questions point fingers at him. Due to this, his true character is brought to the forefront. Consequently, a confrontation breaks out and it leads to an uncanny incident.","popularity":0.544,"poster_path":"/fM6G80eg6xBEm3o00BW5mhv6UTS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":227702,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filam","origin_country":""},{"id":232538,"logo_path":null,"name":"Effulgent Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2022-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A son fakes a media project to face the societal fears his mother has gone through.
