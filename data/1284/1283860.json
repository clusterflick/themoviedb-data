Laird spoke with Ladoo’s family, Trinidad intimates, and members of the Canadian literary scene who helped advance Ladoo’s career in Toronto. Filmed in Trinidad and Toronto, the film attempts to piece together the puzzle of Ladoo’s complex, often tumultuous life, and  his tragic death. Caribbean and Canadian-Caribbean authors Shani Mootoo, Kevin Jared Hosein, Andil Gosine, Ramabai Espinet, and David Chariandy voice Ladoo’s groundbreaking fiction, alongside animated drawings by Trinidadian artist Adam Williams.","popularity":0.0626,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Enigma Of Harold Sonny Ladoo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1302855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Fung","original_name":"Richard Fung","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/6sVJR9nb4rE9tISZH32USSprk9i.jpg","credit_id":"66338961813cb60127870688","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Third Horizon Film Festival","release_date":"2024-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
