The strolling flâneur was the forerunner of the twentieth-century tourist and in particular of the activity which has in a way become emblematic of the tourist: the democratised taking of photographs - of being seen and recorded and seeing others and recording them. The brain is a book - the eye is a camera. Consciousness is going on a trip - a travel into the cities, the heart of ancient Europe and culture - Florence. The human body has to rest. But the brain is corresponding, and the eye is recording. A requiem in slow motion.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":106243,"logo_path":null,"name":"Angel Film & Lyd Aps","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flâneur","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4687822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mette Heiberg","original_name":"Mette Heiberg","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/gRK3wsrSJbSkS0yX8apnbl78Pw8.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6632a03f9590e30129ba57ec","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4655145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Hohnen","original_name":"David Hohnen","popularity":0.0654,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6632a0eac3926601236d2b85","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544710,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Torben Skjødt Jensen","original_name":"Torben Skjødt Jensen","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6632a085af4324012253c267","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544710,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Torben Skjødt Jensen","original_name":"Torben Skjødt Jensen","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6632a014470ead0128109129","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1034350,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anders Koppel","original_name":"Anders Koppel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6632a06499d5c3012c5641b6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544710,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Torben Skjødt Jensen","original_name":"Torben Skjødt Jensen","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6632a026c0442901238de7f2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544710,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Torben Skjødt Jensen","original_name":"Torben Skjødt Jensen","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6632a078813cb6012786877f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"da","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
