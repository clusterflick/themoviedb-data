Everyone in the class had the opportunity to shoot some 16mm film on a Bolex camera. While most of the footage turned out great, there was a significant portion of black, unexposed film in the final scan. These portions stood out to me, almost like a blank canvas waiting to be painted on. Digital editing became my brush, and some beautiful imagery arose from the “waste” of film.","popularity":0.0611,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"let go","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":3348142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"chandler pippin","original_name":"chandler pippin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/u5nPtNiTXSY80YXu8oGWeultCfR.jpg","credit_id":"66330003c616ac012518e2bc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"let go","key":"aJefEPH_sCg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-10-06T03:43:40.000Z","id":"668bbc219f3f305a639a0975"}]}}}
