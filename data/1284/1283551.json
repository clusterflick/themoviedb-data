The division was part of the French Allies, but has been marginalized by official historiography. The work revolves around the relationship and use of photography as an instrument of colonial power, but also as an element of self-representation, as evidence, as a trace.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"With the 4th Moroccan Mountain Division","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2953386,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stefania Smolkina","original_name":"Stefania Smolkina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6632bb88006b0101241d36e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
