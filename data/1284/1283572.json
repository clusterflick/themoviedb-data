CLOSE ENOUGH TO PERFECT is an uplifting story about a young man who brings his rustic, rural values to college with him when he receives a scholarship from a fraternity he must join to receive the gift.  He soon forms a bond with a young lady who has had both legs amputated in a cheerleading-related parade float accident and must fight fraternity hazing and his well-meaning father to continue seeing her.  Her roommate, who is a college cheerleader, also has her eyes on this young ranch kid who does not fit in her world from outward appearances, but it is a time at which she is looking to broaden her horizons and living with an amputee with whom she finds she has so much in common gives her the guidance to grow.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A low-income ranch kid must choose between college on a full-ride scholarship from an exclusive fraternity he must join to receive and a girl without legs whom the frat refuses to allow him to see.","title":"Close Enough To Perfect","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
