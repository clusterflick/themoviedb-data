Shot over a period of four years with motion sensor cameras and linked to Gospodinov's own fragmentary memories of the site's topography, the film poeticizes the gradual destruction of a landscape and questions the ethics of our intrusion into nature. It moves between voyeurism and introspection and is at the same time a portrait of - and an elegy to - Hosbësch.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/fajew3Vzho2Dfflog74LX47hESw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Letzeburgesch","iso_639_1":"lb","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meadows Wait, Mist Diffuses","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2901948,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dzhovani Gospodinov","original_name":"Dzhovani Gospodinov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6632b91cc39266012b6d36cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fajew3Vzho2Dfflog74LX47hESw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Internationale Kurzfilmtage Oberhausen","release_date":"2024-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
