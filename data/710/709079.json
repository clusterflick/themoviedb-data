We take an irreverent look back at the most controversial and outrageous events of this year from the Braveheart exposing his cold, callous, evil thoughts during a drunk driving arrest, “Survivor” revealing that segregation is just experimentation, Britney cutting K-Fed loose to Republicans getting kicked to the curb, 2006 was one spirited year. “Last Laugh ’06” promises to take an equal opportunity jab at our most laughable newsmakers and memorable moments of these past 12 months. Last Laugh ’06 Starring Lewis Black” offers an edgy, alternative year-in-review with Lewis Black leading an all-star line up including Greg Giraldo and Patton Oswalt, who plan to rip into 2006 like Mel Gibson taking on the LAPD…hopefully, without the bigotry…or the botched hair plugs…or a blood alcohol level that could even break Bonaduce. Fasten your seatbelts; this is going to be one wild ride.","popularity":0.7888,"poster_path":"/uSt0GY6gIzWzHZzMitXaF0lnvm2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1538,"logo_path":"/1y7qNFwczl2zZS62Hrlw6dsAwgR.png","name":"Comedy Central","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Laugh '06","video":false,"vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lewis Black","original_name":"Lewis Black","popularity":0.8568,"profile_path":"/1Yvp5dwnJ1UI0KtXGNhZ384wTgv.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Host","credit_id":"5ecd6161021cee00208a826c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patton Oswalt","original_name":"Patton Oswalt","popularity":0.9896,"profile_path":"/skGzommLR2zE6uk1YQRFK71dOJ8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ecd616b8efe73001d15d793","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Giraldo","original_name":"Greg Giraldo","popularity":0.2337,"profile_path":"/4fQ0n5dyohGWpZonnYO49Du0AuL.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ecd6176021cee00228ae570","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0923770","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1393,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uSt0GY6gIzWzHZzMitXaF0lnvm2.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":929}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9716,"name":"stand-up comedy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2006-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
