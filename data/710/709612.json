Examines the survival status of the Ningxia Loess Plateau in the 1980s from a more comprehensive perspective, applying the key words of the popular rock song \"Nothing\": The first part, \"Nothing\"; the second part, \"This is you / The tears are flowing\"; the third part, \"The ground under your feet is shaking\"; the fourth part,\" You follow me.\" In the film, the author also clearly discusses the life in the Plateau from several aspects: water, food, poverty alleviation, education, and labor exportation. A large number of interviews were conducted with local farmers, government officials, poverty alleviation working groups, etc. — trying to find the main factors leading to infertility and the methods that can be adopted to get rid of it, discussing the feasibility and effect of \"going out\" in the second half. The whole film objectively reflects the living conditions of the countryside at that time.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":"/g5iCCFJXkQWkcnIkSMar7axmAjF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"1987-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Into the World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2608188,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kang Jianning","original_name":"Kang Jianning","popularity":0.133,"profile_path":"/9shsnkuEXIHUfk8JscY09QsapqJ.jpg","credit_id":"5ecf089396386400246bfb15","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1356193,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gao Feng","original_name":"Gao Feng","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675d6a61018dc8e7bbd1809d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/g5iCCFJXkQWkcnIkSMar7axmAjF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.623,"height":802,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jJhqmC9rvFPH25wNrAheisd3DaM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Chinese\", \"english_name\"=>\"Mandarin\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"zh\", \"native_name\"=>\"Chinese\"}","note":"","release_date":"1987-06-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
