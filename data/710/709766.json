Holder of 48 honorary doctorate degrees, born in the 1890s, he was a philosopher and engineer whose experience and global view of humanity and science enabled him to transcend nationalism and temporary current conditions and foresee the direction of major events in the future.  He created the geodesic dome to show how much can be accomplished utilizing very little.  In this program and series of interviews, he points out how mankind is moving from the tangible world which can be evidenced by sight, sound, smell and touch, into the invisible world of energy, ions, electrical forces, etc., so much so that 99.9999% of what affects our reality will be undetectable by our senses.  He expresses many fascinating theories in these interviews that conditions today confirm.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Scientist, Artist, Philosopher","title":"Buckminster Fuller: The Lost Interviews","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Buckminster Fuller - Lost Interviews - DVD part 1/2","key":"elVGz_VR3eU","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2012-09-18T19:43:41.000Z","id":"5ecfc148528b2e002067341e"}]}}}
