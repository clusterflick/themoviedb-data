Anna and Harlan lived life as few people in modern times have and in doing so inspired thousands. Wonder: The Lives of Anna and Harlan Hubbard , a new documentary by Morgan Atkinson, brings to life their adventures. Harlan was an artist, writer and naturalist born in northern Kentucky. Anna, a scholar and librarian from Grand Rapids, MI. They met in Cincinnati and began their life together in the mid-1940's by building a boat, then floating from Cincinnati to New Orleans. Their voyage lasted five years. They then settled on the banks of the Ohio River in rural Kentucky. In a house they built by hand, sustained by food they raised or caught, aided by no electricity or modern convenience, Anna and Harlan, met the world on their own terms and found deep meaning. Wonder considers their astonishing life of freedom and what it says to Americans today.","popularity":0.0679,"poster_path":"/hoZfQCZB3yzZUW1Wf8VSnA8VO5v.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134603,"logo_path":null,"name":"Duckworks","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wonder: The Lives of Anna and Harlan Hubbard","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77080,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Oldham","original_name":"Will Oldham","popularity":0.16,"profile_path":"/of8XRGkUjZ0DplI6BP5Kxw4o6yR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Harlan Hubbard (voice)","credit_id":"5ece056f3dc3130020c6fb71","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2655981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katie Blackerby","original_name":"Katie Blackerby","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Anna Hubbard","credit_id":"5ece05bb3dc3130021c6d542","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2655990,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Fred Harbuck","original_name":"Fred Harbuck","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ece065921c4ca0020db7bb8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2655986,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Morgan Atkinson","original_name":"Morgan Atkinson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ece067aaaec7100206667f2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2655992,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Steve Hurst","original_name":"Steve Hurst","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ece06bfe4b576001f2a525f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2655986,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Morgan Atkinson","original_name":"Morgan Atkinson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ece063aaaec71001f6610b7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2655992,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Steve Hurst","original_name":"Steve Hurst","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ece0699e4b57600202a214d","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2655986,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Morgan Atkinson","original_name":"Morgan Atkinson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ece06155c071b001e2757a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2578312","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hoZfQCZB3yzZUW1Wf8VSnA8VO5v.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1063}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
