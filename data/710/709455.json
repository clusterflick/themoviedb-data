Bush cites Egypt as the country that will pave the way for democracy in the Middle East. Three women, unable to sit by while their country is on the brink of drastic change, start a grassroots movement to educate and empower the public by raising awareness about the meaning of democracy. They name their campaign Shayfeen.com, which means to “we are watching you.” This film follows the highs and lows of the first year of the movement in Egypt. Insisting that only the people can make change happen, their goal is to educate the Egyptian public on what it takes to build the most basic pillars of democracy: demanding basic human rights, freedom of speech and the establishment of an independent judiciary. Egypt: We are Watching You shows the role ordinary citizens can play in shaping and securing their democracy.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/3N13cYSIs4FdOI96JEDHDWmmuAB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Egypt: We are watching you","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"埃及民主觀察站","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31056441","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3N13cYSIs4FdOI96JEDHDWmmuAB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
