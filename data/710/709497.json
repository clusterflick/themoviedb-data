Asamura is strong in fighting but not in making money, and together with his brother Matsuo, he forcibly takes on the business of the rival Nishinaga clan. The Nishinaga clan tries to take Asamura's sister, Yuna, a singer, hostage, but Asamura retaliates against them and kills many members of the clan. When Asamura is arrested for murder, his timing is so good that he begins to suspect a connection between the police and Nishinaga-gumi.","popularity":0.8265,"poster_path":"/mQDA6AumlWPodfuL0pJK2SMt6t9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2017-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wild Ones:  The Unorthodox Yakuza","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":552027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kazuyoshi Ozawa","original_name":"小沢和義","popularity":0.7585,"profile_path":"/ckoyVwiNkEqaGEIYIp0vHtXOjW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ecebd1d5c071b001c2803bb","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1349948,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rin Ogawa","original_name":"緒川凛","popularity":2.19,"profile_path":"/ipmNMTC8DUeshzsXi9HwzHvXjwj.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ecebd33e61e6d001dcb8324","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":548133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yasukaze Motomiya","original_name":"本宮泰風","popularity":0.7318,"profile_path":"/psL6KI2IktDBICsrEw4zKDKdnOe.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5ecebd3d764841001ce80a4a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":554073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hiroyuki Watanabe","original_name":"渡辺裕之","popularity":0.8142,"profile_path":"/2RJ3jFTq0uifpQ02EKRhwkLnEIz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5ecebd48528b2e002065565d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hideo Nakano","original_name":"中野英雄","popularity":0.5051,"profile_path":"/7MK9M0WlC5w184FAPMMzNdkH5MH.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"63e428e022e480008fefb523","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2504637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hideyuki Kawahara","original_name":"川原英之","popularity":0.2934,"profile_path":"/5ZCKSR11ZBYdNKzQytjPmFXUkMk.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"63e428fc7304b5007e64e14b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2440949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Junpei Yamamoto","original_name":"Junpei Yamamoto","popularity":0.0502,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"63e42934db154f0085c84ab3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hidekazu Akai","original_name":"赤井英和","popularity":0.6281,"profile_path":"/iyOWLfVdRu73vxwwf51lj0G0Evy.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"63e429747304b500b40108e8","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68989,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hitoshi Ozawa","original_name":"小沢仁志","popularity":0.8392,"profile_path":"/m2mLrkCcttT2fgHBMfObbq6G0sw.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"63e429827304b500b40108ed","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2656791,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shin Hamamizu","original_name":"Shin Hamamizu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecebd8921c4ca0020dcc2fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mQDA6AumlWPodfuL0pJK2SMt6t9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1048}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Japanese\", \"english_name\"=>\"Japanese\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"ja\", \"native_name\"=>\"Japanese\"}","note":"","release_date":"2017-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"狂犬と呼ばれた男たちシリーズ第二弾！主演・小沢和義　『狂犬と呼ばれた男たち 外道ヤクザ』予告　狂犬―それは影として生きる男の物語　オールインエンタテインメント","key":"-y23lY5MC9w","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2017-03-02T07:00:01.000Z","id":"5ecebdc821c4ca001fdb9722"}]}}}
