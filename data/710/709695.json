Aya Shirakaba became a third-year student at Otome High School, and now it's only one year before graduating. It's been another year since she lived with her homeroom teacher, Arihiko Tairaku, but at that time, a story about a marriage with May was brought up in Tairaku. On the other hand, Aya's father, who wanted to separate her daughter who is too close to Tairaku from him, tells Aya about studying abroad. Aya listens to her father and decides to study abroad. Ayaka Morikawa and Ryouma Baba, who have starred in the whole series, play Aya and Tairaku respectively, and Sena Natsuki, a gravure idol, plays the role of May who is in a triangular relationship with the two.","popularity":0.7062,"poster_path":"/g5Clyptms2bcxEKNoP62fMbKPK7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3032,"logo_path":"/gaf3ez34cuvG9snphWGreB1WerA.png","name":"Nippan Group Holdings","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2019-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Not in Textbooks 6","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Kyôkasho ni nai! 6","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1920828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ayaka Morikawa","original_name":"森川 彩香","popularity":0.232,"profile_path":"/oF98nOQTKYS5P6UteJNsrKBKjyZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Aya Shirakaba","credit_id":"5ecf669521c4ca0020ddf46e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1098324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryoma Baba","original_name":"馬場良馬","popularity":0.3784,"profile_path":"/2MCYKQWTFSnbi44L9hzv5XGEULu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Arihiko Tairaku","credit_id":"5ecf66a6aaec71002068e66c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2657490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sena Natsuki","original_name":"奈月セナ","popularity":1.6191,"profile_path":"/wHTdQH2KSRXHfLMYFIW9e72HwDo.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"May Yayoi","credit_id":"5ecf685521c4ca0021dcd5b4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1801592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yurisa","original_name":"百合沙","popularity":0.3252,"profile_path":"/22V6BahAAzhfUd1u2DCof3u3jtx.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Saki Kosuge","credit_id":"5ecf68b696386400236c6859","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1717745,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wataru Ichinose","original_name":"一ノ瀬ワタル","popularity":0.5334,"profile_path":"/42jf08JObm44xjpg6F1G1DHtOhk.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Okubo","credit_id":"5ecf68f65c071b001e29cbda","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1053024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomoya Ishii","original_name":"石井智也","popularity":0.0878,"profile_path":"/gcbYYZ6UV9ISBvIvvWVfhIka65x.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"65481fcad55c3d00e2129323","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2050648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Misaki Soejima","original_name":"Misaki Soejima","popularity":0.0605,"profile_path":"/7ZB8YABuVtUIPR1ZIPN34VNzrpr.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"65481fd79cc67b00df93e1ef","order":6},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2599627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rika Mari","original_name":"麻里梨夏","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/5giJo6XWWTGCyYRqwK0w4RT9sOJ.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"654821bffd4f800101b6718a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1309933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shō Jinnai","original_name":"陳内将","popularity":0.1904,"profile_path":"/xQ6JiE2KN3V6hHiRIlJNOi3JH6p.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"654828829cc67b00df93e401","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2657489,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Takayuki Imara","original_name":"Takayuki Imara","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/c7spFwuVCQac87UydS5HwpkcKeO.jpg","credit_id":"5ecf6792e61e6d001ccc81ca","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2002941,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shota Sasaki","original_name":"Shota Sasaki","popularity":0.0607,"profile_path":"/vqX4bY5tLwucfN5IVRiK1EtHGEZ.jpg","credit_id":"5ecf664896386400236c65b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11371700","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2eJ3T0QiPD0tSyRHc9IhqSbh0J3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g5Clyptms2bcxEKNoP62fMbKPK7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Japanese\", \"english_name\"=>\"Japanese\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"ja\", \"native_name\"=>\"Japanese\"}","note":"","release_date":"2019-07-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"劇場版　教科書にないッ！6","key":"UWaIi0Y7Y-c","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-11-05T14:13:34.000Z","id":"5ecf65c8764841001ce8ceaa"}]}}}
