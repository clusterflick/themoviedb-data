The film follows Antonio, Santiago and Oscar, three friends rooted deeply inside that soil, from where they are able to re-imagine ttheir lives and challenge the practical limitations of their social and historical circumstances.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unquiet Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"Tierra Inquieta\" trailer","key":"255070090","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-02-09T17:19:55.000Z","id":"5eced8a05900860023c621f7"}]}}}
