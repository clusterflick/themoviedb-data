Broadcast on the BBC's German Service, the programme gave voice to ordinary East German citizens who wrote about life under the repressive communist regime. On the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, this documentary explores an unknown story of the Cold War. It looks at the impact of the Letters without Signature series on both the letter writers in East Germany - who faced jail if discovered - and the producers of the show in London, particularly its mysterious presenter, Austin Harrison. Using never-before-seen Stasi files and recordings, London Calling: Cold War Letters documents the tit-for-tat propaganda war between the Stasi and BBC. It reveals a fascinating world of spies, secret state subterfuge and individual acts of bravery.","popularity":0.1651,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":134715,"logo_path":null,"name":"Schulz/Wendelmann Film","origin_country":""},{"id":134716,"logo_path":null,"name":"State of Grace Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"London Calling: Cold War Letters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Livet bakom muren","type":"TV Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2657868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucy Tregear","original_name":"Lucy Tregear","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"self (voice)","credit_id":"5ecfd89796386400236ce981","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1586625,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Christian H.
