Non-linear, dreamlike and spectral, Black Kites is a testament to artistry, imagination and the resiliency of the human psyche. Features sensitive performances by Steve Buscemi, Mimi Goese and Mira Furlan, a prominent actress from the former Yugoslavia, as the narrator.","popularity":0.2854,"poster_path":"/iWKUZBAQPoCzzqT6WFmOs36nlUL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":547,"logo_path":null,"name":"Open City Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Kites","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Schwarze Drachen","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Buscemi","original_name":"Steve Buscemi","popularity":3.3764,"profile_path":"/lQKdHMxfYcCBOvwRKBAxPZVNtkg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ecd283419690c001d717fe5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":36217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mira Furlan","original_name":"Mira Furlan","popularity":0.4663,"profile_path":"/kZ0U4z3oFh5hXw1qVaB3fhKQc4T.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5ecd28401da7a6001dcfd925","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1917657,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mimi Goese","original_name":"Mimi Goese","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5ecd285ee2bca800208b6b18","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2960713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucian Buscemi","original_name":"Lucian Buscemi","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6017e54f7314a1003bf51452","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1384587,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maryette Charlton","original_name":"Maryette Charlton","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6017e58aea39490041275aff","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5271,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lisa Rinzler","original_name":"Lisa Rinzler","popularity":0.1363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606059aba39d0b0054145e58","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2362375,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jo Andres","original_name":"Jo Andres","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60716a124b9bae00578c655a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2362375,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jo Andres","original_name":"Jo Andres","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60716a31dfaae9005a531bb6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2362375,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jo Andres","original_name":"Jo Andres","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecd287219690c001d718027","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13234,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joana Vicente","original_name":"Joana Vicente","popularity":0.0692,"profile_path":"/1ilvmzPKaHJDhYTGooIitlNBIgB.jpg","credit_id":"6017e499d96c3c003e13f8e8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":36194,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hahn Rowe","original_name":"Hahn Rowe","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6017e4461b70ae003e645d74","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2960711,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jason Kilot","original_name":"Jason Kilot","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6017e4d5907f26003e57d7d3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0115692","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iWKUZBAQPoCzzqT6WFmOs36nlUL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1996-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
