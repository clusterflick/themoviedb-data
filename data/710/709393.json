The siege of Masada, recorded nearly 2,000 years ago by Jewish military leader Flavius Josephus, is more than a tale of resistance against impossible odds. It's part of the founding narrative of Israel. But how much of it is true? We take a look at the events that inspired the CBS television miniseries \"The Dovekeepers\" and go to the site of the mountain fortress itself, uncovering new truths about this epic conflict.","popularity":0.1284,"poster_path":"/xG7CkAs9Eo17meTOMGZ20Vv6Sag.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Siege of Masada","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sty3M2D90xC9ogEeWNsIMPzRrvS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xG7CkAs9Eo17meTOMGZ20Vv6Sag.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s8e9HKvCAsngugz61bXIG375EYP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bkHXUIisU8ihPhLsTghRTilFUPf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
