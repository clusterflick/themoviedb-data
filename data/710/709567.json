But none of the areas are affected as severely as Southern California, where the radiation has created an infestation of zombies. Following Giovanni Fish and his family, Red Days follows a small group of survivors as they battle zombies and learn to live under a new communist regime. Set in the Not So Sane Universe, Red Days begins as the United States falls into chaos after seven simultaneous nuclear devices are set off, causing civil war and a break up of the union. Van and his family struggle to survive the aftermath of the attack. Stranded in his house for nearly five years, Van attempts to keep zombies from destroying what’s left of his existence as he slowly watches everything he believed in and knew about himself crumble into nothing. His last hope comes as his daughter who disappeared on the night of the attacks returns, but she has a secret of her own that could either save or condemn Van.","popularity":0.5368,"poster_path":"/wxsVvW5n5bneiU3DksJmohOjrQQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Days","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2171834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sérgio Cantú","original_name":"Sérgio Cantú","popularity":0.075,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5eceed9c528b2e001f644051","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2439779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bradley Bates","original_name":"Bradley Bates","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5eceedae21c4ca0021dc2bba","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2657095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xiomara Bernudez","original_name":"Xiomara Bernudez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5eceedc421c4ca001fdbb175","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1465605,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brett William Mauser","original_name":"Brett William Mauser","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/cILC8VqPcJ8fEzC6YOPOSXp403G.jpg","credit_id":"5eceede4e61e6d001ccbe3ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12470822","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jAVu3BvDVslNZ1OgN1whbplgP1X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1333,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wxsVvW5n5bneiU3DksJmohOjrQQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"RED DAYS Trailer","key":"590G0DU-_X0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2019-11-26T06:33:54.000Z","id":"5fa7f2e08c7b0f00417999fe"}]}}}
