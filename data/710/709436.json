Mary Joy Dao-Ay is a Filipino maid who used to be a domestic worker in Lebanon. She left her 3 children in the Philippines, planning to pay for their education by earning a higher salary working in the Middle East. Instead, she was forced to flee for her own safety, and got stuck in Lebanon seeking refuge at a shelter. THE SECRET SLAVES OF THE MIDDLE EAST is the story of Mary Joys’ desperate struggle for justice, in a country with no labour laws protecting foreign domestic workers, and where the special Arab Kafala System renders it impossible for an unskilled worker to leave the country or change their employer. It is the story of how poverty leads unprivileged women from developing countries to be deceived and trafficked into slavery.","popularity":0.1814,"poster_path":"/iCR9eF4fKfJLOuEwbf4MPvu9G7l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":203755,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Why Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Secret Slaves of the Middle East","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":84379,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mette Hoffman Meyer","original_name":"Mette Hoffman Meyer","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64aa2fa6d1a89300e2f90a6b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8377,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Cliff Martinez","original_name":"Cliff Martinez","popularity":0.1442,"profile_path":"/enudxtWAhqpSwdlfmKY5fLJ1Tod.jpg","credit_id":"64aa2f8d9c97bd01390c9d33","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4153496,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mathias Vejen","original_name":"Mathias Vejen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64aa2fae3e2ec800cbcdacba","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2540595,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Puk Damsgaard Andersen","original_name":"Puk Damsgaard Andersen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/75Wpfn58MaW4B6pICYgZ4DipTao.jpg","credit_id":"64aa2f8666a0d300ade803a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14011582","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iCR9eF4fKfJLOuEwbf4MPvu9G7l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Secret Slaves of the Middle East⎜WHY WOMEN?⎜(Trailer)","key":"RydoHZIojC4","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-05-05T16:06:48.000Z","id":"64aa301e3e2ec800af7d5dce"}]}}}
