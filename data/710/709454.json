By his own admission, he felt Flaubert, Dostoevsky and Gogol as his \"blood brothers\", but he bequeathed to burn his manuscripts. However, friends violated the last will of the author. Kafka's works, filled with bizarre images and paradoxical plots, were published posthumously and brought him worldwide fame. Today, Kafka is perceived as a brilliant prophet of the madness of the 20th century, and his name has become synonymous with a special type of absurdity.","popularity":0.2306,"poster_path":"/ahL2KISc9o6AYuFFDkEBqaz9qf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178916,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gogol Center","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2016-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":190,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gogol Online: Kafka","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1251928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Odin Lund Biron","original_name":"Один Ланд Байрон","popularity":0.2577,"profile_path":"/3wyVQKbirrCyRdAhVPN74vZXGJT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ecebe3fe61e6d001ecc0040","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2009631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Semen Shteinberg","original_name":"Семён Штейнберг","popularity":0.1394,"profile_path":"/4duvJrwNp9BKbQg2U1B7ZJe8Vrm.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5ecebe633dc313001fc8a73b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1471758,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evgeny Sangadzhiev","original_name":"Евгений Сангаджиев","popularity":0.1955,"profile_path":"/pSW1N6hCGZAHMzw5iBXkmmuzDK.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5ecebe795900860022c6190b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1381293,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Svetlana Mamresheva","original_name":"Svetlana Mamresheva","popularity":0.0684,"profile_path":"/woVwSjXYMtuizdme2HoM3FIKsLA.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5ecebe85aaec71001f66f2c0","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557984,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kirill Serebrennikov","original_name":"Kirill Serebrennikov","popularity":0.2299,"profile_path":"/csxQOPUf3xoew4lEjXiWgFRWJV7.jpg","credit_id":"6279346c323eba5246bdac98","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ahL2KISc9o6AYuFFDkEBqaz9qf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1333}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
