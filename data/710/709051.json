She decides to visit her remaining family members to show them the footage, but eventually realizes that the ghost is actually only visible to her. Thinking that the ghost is either of her father who committed suicide when she was a child, or one of her older brothers who drowned to death, she feels that her entire family has been cursed. What starts out as a casual visit to her family gradually turns into a horrifying experience as one person is killed after another. What did she capture on camera? Or did she really capture anything at all?","popularity":0.0693,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2010-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Intolerance Now","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Niju Isseiki","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2654940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hiroyasu Kawabata","original_name":"Hiroyasu Kawabata","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ecd47571da7a6001dcffdd8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2654941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kazuma Nakamoto","original_name":"Kazuma Nakamoto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ecd477a021cee00228accbd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2654942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mirei Nakamoto","original_name":"Mirei Nakamoto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5ecd479019690c001d71ab51","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2654944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomohiro Ureshino","original_name":"Tomohiro Ureshino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5ecd47a8d18b240025417e47","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2654945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Satsuki Yamauchi","original_name":"Satsuki Yamauchi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5ecd47c61da7a6001bd0314d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2654946,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takahiro Yamauchi","original_name":"Takahiro Yamauchi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecd47eb35818f0021c1554a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2654947,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Takahiro Yamauchi","original_name":"Takahiro Yamauchi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecd480735818f0021c15560","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2654951,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Takahiro Yamauchi","original_name":"Takahiro Yamauchi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecd48e61da7a6001bd03323","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2654950,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tomohiro Ureshino","original_name":"Tomohiro Ureshino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecd48cc35818f0020c1e9b5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1703240","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Japanese\", \"english_name\"=>\"Japanese\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"ja\", \"native_name\"=>\"Japanese\"}","note":"","release_date":"2010-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
