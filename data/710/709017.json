A visual personal journey from when I left Baghdad at age 17, the stills and films becoming my diary recording my nightmares, my feelings, looking for a homeland that was so far removed by fear and wars. The style of the film is proof of my experiencing the world through my camera, I am a witness throughout my exile.","popularity":0.045,"poster_path":"/rhFjxJBPD6MGw4JmqtpytyALjJT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IQ","name":"Iraq"}],"release_date":"2017-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stories of Passers Through","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1262726,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Koutaiba Al-Janabi","original_name":"Koutaiba Al-Janabi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecd3059d18b2400244199c4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7756440","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.659,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rhFjxJBPD6MGw4JmqtpytyALjJT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":658}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Dubai International Film Festival","release_date":"2017-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
