This second show starts exactly where the first show ended: in the same theatrical scenery, with the same robot. But this time Wertheim surprises his audience by showing up. He tells about how the first experimental comedy show was received and contemplates about the magic of theatre and art in a society about the right to exist of art in a society that allows less and less doubt and confusion. When Robot falls into a depression, the boundaries between theater and reality begin to blur.","popularity":0.3209,"poster_path":"/pb7uIT3CYpCql0aIv6k9wU0uW6N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135158,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bunker Theaterzaken","origin_country":""},{"id":100462,"logo_path":"/24dhPKt8sDtfWfNs1rsVtskOwZZ.png","name":"BNNVARA","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2017-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Micha Wertheim: Someone Else","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":543976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Micha Wertheim","original_name":"Micha Wertheim","popularity":0.2312,"profile_path":"/wfebZNEZFclkeDwJASM3O44aK9x.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"himself","credit_id":"5ecfc8a5528b2e0020674194","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2657027,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gijsbert van der Wal","original_name":"Gijsbert van der Wal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/7sSwxoHUiwHsEP7auJXZQjQS68H.jpg","credit_id":"60ce72de5ed9620058f48264","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2657028,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Bram den Haan","original_name":"Bram den Haan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ce73037a3c520078e6f68b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2657028,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Bram den Haan","original_name":"Bram den Haan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ce730fa579f9006f26f3b0","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2657030,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Andy Puharich","original_name":"Andy Puharich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ce731d967cc7006e28a5fc","department":"Art","job":"Decorator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2657033,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mat Wijn","original_name":"Mat Wijn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ce732c7a3c520058db6d50","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54898,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Thomas Kist","original_name":"Thomas Kist","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":"/7vHPz2q9MLB9W0x6UaNelwXWT5e.jpg","credit_id":"60ce733a13654500407a2856","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2729860,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Menke Visser","original_name":"Menke Visser","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ce734333ad8f006de84726","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2934425,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Martin Mulder","original_name":"Martin Mulder","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ce73529f51af0058e168b9","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1645799,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Philip Smeulders","original_name":"Philip Smeulders","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ce736b0021340057a1af8b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3129988,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Geert Vriend","original_name":"Geert Vriend","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ce737a2da84600568cd34d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1824647,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kathleen Warners","original_name":"Kathleen Warners","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":"/dyVCeux9kPQdV5jyvnGE7DPxcbv.jpg","credit_id":"60ce7384d399e6005aca85fb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":543976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Micha Wertheim","original_name":"Micha Wertheim","popularity":0.2312,"profile_path":"/wfebZNEZFclkeDwJASM3O44aK9x.jpg","credit_id":"5ecfc85421c4ca0020de9aa7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7599806","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/az9ctRcD6JpAeE5QgV347lpHeOl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":758,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pb7uIT3CYpCql0aIv6k9wU0uW6N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":532}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9716,"name":"stand-up comedy"},{"id":235894,"name":"theater performance"},{"id":264598,"name":"tv special"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"AL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"TV special","release_date":"2017-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
