In 1989, Wen Pulin and Duan Jinchuan followed several monks up the mountain and took video of them. After three years, they revisited the same people and got a little closer to understanding their lives. As an in-depth dialogue with down-to-earth, rural people in Tibet, the film strives to understand Buddhism both as a philosophy, but also as a personal choice of lifestyle, as a transcendence of the chaos of life.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/pCXsbeh3SQsCzZRFSj9iklToKbK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sacred Site for Asceticism","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1497665,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jinchuan Duan","original_name":"Jinchuan Duan","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ececaaa5900860021c61228","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2326741,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wen Pulin","original_name":"Wen Pulin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/n2DnyKuGwSmMiJd9ditrotStUwG.jpg","credit_id":"5ececac2aaec710021668f06","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34941907","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pCXsbeh3SQsCzZRFSj9iklToKbK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Chinese\", \"english_name\"=>\"Mandarin\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"zh\", \"native_name\"=>\"Chinese\"}","note":"","release_date":"1992-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"the third Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"1993-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
