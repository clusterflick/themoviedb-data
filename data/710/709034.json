Cast in an abandoned Venice – a derelict film set in Luxembourg, as it turns out – this short fiction relates a meeting of a curator, a theorist, a painter and a “relational” artist who appear to engage in complex theoretical debates. Their verbal confrontation – a grotesque patchwork of quotes that mocks the art world’s infatuation with sampling and referencing – is punctuated by a string of dreamlike sequences in which the stereotypical characters are seen killing each other in the best tradition of mondo films.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/jjiS6bDWbUEfv5WzQD7yd5Af87f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":213401,"logo_path":null,"name":"Maciste Film","origin_country":"LU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LU","name":"Luxembourg"}],"release_date":"2005-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mondo Veneziano: High Noon in the Sinking City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4372703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Otto Berchem","original_name":"Otto Berchem","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Convivial Artist","credit_id":"65515a11d4fe0400ac34273c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4372704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marianne Gerber","original_name":"Marianne Gerber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Curator","credit_id":"65515a18ea84c710959b4a53","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4372705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taygun Nowbary","original_name":"Taygun Nowbary","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Painter","credit_id":"65515a21fd6fa100ab969d4b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4372706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andreï Volfson","original_name":"Andreï Volfson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Theorist","credit_id":"65515a2b9653f613f8623b05","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4372707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaetano Coletta","original_name":"Gaetano Coletta","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Waiter","credit_id":"65515a35d4fe04011b8f404a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4372708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carla Gutenkauf-Grün","original_name":"Carla Gutenkauf-Grün","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Babuschka","credit_id":"65515a410816c700e017033d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4372710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laure Junio","original_name":"Laure Junio","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Babuschka","credit_id":"65515a4efd6fa101380ad21a","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antoine Prum","original_name":"Antoine Prum","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655159daea84c710922528b6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antoine Prum","original_name":"Antoine Prum","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecd39cb19690c001c70a3c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":49804,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Erik Krambeck","original_name":"Erik Krambeck","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecd39ed35818f0021c142b3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jjiS6bDWbUEfv5WzQD7yd5Af87f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":511}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
