The War is over, and it has left a slew of devastated families in its wake. Among them are Maria and her mother, two refugees who find themselves working on a farm in the German countryside after they are forced out of their home by violence and political upheaval. It is there that little Maria makes an unlikely friend: an American soldier — an enemy soldier — who, through one act of unnecessary kindness, teaches Maria and her family a powerful lesson in compassion and humanity during the most inhumane of times.","popularity":0.2578,"poster_path":"/iE7gtq0bFpTk7k8cg0yglxot1lr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83552,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chapman
