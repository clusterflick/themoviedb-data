Visually, it looks like a toy tank, but it's packed with firepower and power. The 20mm machine gun and the anti-tank guided missile TOW are dangerous weapons. The weasel was designed to be extra small and light so that it can be quickly brought into its field of application by helicopter and transport aircraft. It is probably the most diverse armored vehicle in the Bundeswehr.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/dGO0rjKTPWVmZHMXHcqDB3t0M4u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118699,"logo_path":"/vwRFENNv8h0ZLRJbjcyWNxNbX3g.png","name":"Welt","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wiesel Tracked Vehicle - Firepower For Paratroopers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":1752,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zmWQaQ97pJ39oF1R30fDJjzYbpL.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3120},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hrRYHZjh512bMulta47phaOCEcx.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dGO0rjKTPWVmZHMXHcqDB3t0M4u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"D24","release_date":"2021-04-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
