The music and Verdi himself were subsumed into a surge of patriotic fervor culminating in the foundation of the modern nation of Italy. Specifically, the Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves ('Va, pensiero'), in which the Israelites express their longing for their homeland, came to stand for the country’s aspirations for unity and that exciting era in Italian history, the Risorgimento, or 'Resurgence'.","popularity":0.7302,"poster_path":"/5jxtDQ9lYLQMC65YIA4imOZcD3A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15005,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Metropolitan
