As the threat of war loomed between Trump & the West and Kim Jong Un & North Korea, KFA set out to defend the independence and socialist construction of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, to fight the “mirror of lies,” and to promote its Juche Ideology, the official state ideology of North Korea.  For the first time, Dermot allowed a film crew into his work and home in order to tell his story. This short documentary delves into Hudson's life to capture a portrait of a man alienated by his own nation and unafraid to speak out against the status quo, even at the peak of media and public hysteria.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Friend of Kim","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
