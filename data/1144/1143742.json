Whether it is held in private collections, or kept under lock and key in museums and libraries worldwide, erotic art and literature remains censored. But when graphic, even extreme sexual imagery is freely available on the Internet, why is erotic art considered so dangerous that it must be prohibited? Filmed in England, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden and the U.S., SECRET MUSEUMS explores the locked rooms, warehouses, museum cellars, bank safes and private homes where erotica is hidden, from the British Museum and the National Library of France to Munich's National Graphics Collection and the Vatican, home of the world's largest collection of pornography. Gaining access to carefully guarded collections with names such as \"Secretum,\" \"Gabinetto Segreto\" and \"L'Enfer,\" the film reveals books and images never before filmed or photographed.","popularity":0.0505,"poster_path":"/9qpORwHw2ODFZlYb2LZ9g9HWyaF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17313,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sophimages","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2008-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Secret Museums","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Geheime Museen","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2078922,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Woditsch","original_name":"Peter Woditsch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6495dd108805510144149d09","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1187308","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1333,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9qpORwHw2ODFZlYb2LZ9g9HWyaF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
