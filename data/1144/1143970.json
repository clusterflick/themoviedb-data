Ellsberg explains the “institutional madness” of American nuclear war plans and how the Russian invasion of Ukraine has made the world far more dangerous. The documentary will trace Ellsberg’s journey from being a Cold War hawk to becoming an anti-nuclear weapons activist, a stance he held right up to his death. Ellsberg warns that the nuclear weapons arsenals of the U.S. and Russia are still very much a threat to global peace and that an all-out nuclear war remains capable of being launched from missile silos or submarines on a few minutes’ notice.","popularity":0.483,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"How to Stop a Nuclear War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Ellsberg","original_name":"Daniel Ellsberg","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":"/sEv8SOfcMzOKiVOlM5OQxOk5qf0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6496bd7662f33500ca430d7b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":7056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Thompson","original_name":"Emma Thompson","popularity":4.6055,"profile_path":"/xr8Ki3CIqweWWqS5q0kUYdiK6oQ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6496be3aeb79c20139e8ec72","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2394618,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rob Johnson","original_name":"Rob Johnson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6496bdf3eb79c200e29e7371","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112215,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Jay","original_name":"Paul Jay","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/57UI1IIM1G89AYpPSeXVdgAjjC0.jpg","credit_id":"6496be2abbd0b001252a7b00","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Ellsberg","original_name":"Daniel Ellsberg","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":"/sEv8SOfcMzOKiVOlM5OQxOk5qf0.jpg","credit_id":"6496be496f43ec00ac3ab907","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2354462,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Earl Katz","original_name":"Earl Katz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6496bdcbbbd0b001066e5031","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
