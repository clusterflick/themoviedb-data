This film takes a deeper look into how a tradition for many OFWs (Oversea Filipino Workers) and immigrants became a billion-dollar industry. Balikbayan, meaning ‚Äúto return\" has changed meaning over the years. As we follow Liway‚Äôs journey and what it means for her to be able to send back her wealth, we also gain historical insight into these boxes and the business behind them.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Please Handle With Care","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4127297,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angeline Javier","original_name":"Angeline Javier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6495d1c0a284eb00c5bd77d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
