Helena and Louise are happy in their relationship if it wasn't for this huge wall separating them. The only solution is writing letters. But what the two of them don't know is that Stasi officer Bernd who works for the surveillance department, is enjoying their constant letter exchanges as his daily bed time story. While Bernd has yet to figure out how to read between the lines, his assistant Eberhardt grows suspicious and desperately tries to open Bernd's eyes. But maybe Bernd isn't as oblivious as Eberhardt thinks he is. While the officers are playing hide and seek with Louise's and Helena's letters, the women are already in the midst of escaping. Nothing can stop them now. Except for maybe...the Fall of the Wall?","popularity":0.405,"poster_path":"/dB1l1Qij0t7zl49zpOXdK4IvMNS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United
