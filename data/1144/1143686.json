Inspired by the aesthetic approaches found in Nollywood  , Documentaries and other genres, and through a fictional narrative. The film centres around Abeba, a young migrant who moved recently to the UK. She works as a cleaner; the film follows her daily routine. We see Abeba doing mundane everyday chores. One day after work, Abeba receives a text message from a guy that she fancies inviting her to a house party. While getting ready for the party, she receives a sudden phone call from her overbearing mother. During the call, Abeba engages in a web of lies to escape her mother's interrogation.","popularity":0.233,"poster_path":"/zxB6AUUOIZwINeZOBF0AuVMgtAq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Igbo","iso_639_1":"ig","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abeba","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4127264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa","original_name":"Lisa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Abeba","credit_id":"6495ca81d5ffcb00ffe872f5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4127268,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Miranda","original_name":"Miranda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6495cb3e88055100c87e22b8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4127731,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Al-anoud Ibrahim","original_name":"Al-anoud Ibrahim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64960de0955c6501242766fd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4127767,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amna Ibrahim","original_name":"Amna Ibrahim","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649611ddbbd0b001066df54e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4127768,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Amna Ibrahim","original_name":"Amna Ibrahim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649611f16f43ec00c5c5929c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28298299","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/nW6JZ83jfLlU3WQ5aA1BKm48LFg.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1587},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":"ar","file_path":"/gAQPzjEyZ2vfKfBOW2DLseywqM0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/ohhZK4PjBpmJCzN2rFvRrx9hZnn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":"ig","file_path":"/zxB6AUUOIZwINeZOBF0AuVMgtAq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":283800,"name":"docufiction"},{"id":284361,"name":"nollywood"},{"id":319624,"name":"hybrid film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ig","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
