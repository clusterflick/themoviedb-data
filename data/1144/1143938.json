PREFACE TO A HISTORY, created with a tiny crew of four people, represents an experiment in using minimalist tools to create an overwhelming aesthetic experience in service of a simple, but specifically contemporary, story about two people attempting to navigate a fraying relationship amid all the anxieties and external pressures of modern adulthood in a technologically-interconnected and politically unstable era.","popularity":0.4322,"poster_path":"/gfBEsDZI6ONMJy8HAU9qqb6BEi0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":58759,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sad Hill
