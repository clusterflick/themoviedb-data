For 14 days you will experience a dense program of churches, art, vodka and the Volga. You will be chased through old villages with hundreds of souvenir stands. On the ship you will learn Russian songs and folk dances and can do gymnastics under supervision. But the film lives from the protagonists, the idealistic Renate, who mourns communist Russia, Peter, who doesn't like traveling, who only went along for the sake of his girlfriend (\"One tree looks like another\"), and the passionate Ellen, who is unhappy in... Peter in love. A helicopter is flown in to rescue a seriously ill passenger. But what also makes the cynical Peter think are the wonderful sunsets, the beautiful nature, the peace and the vastness of the Russian landscape. And in the end, a little piece of the Russian soul remains.","popularity":0.0958,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2007-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mit Olga auf der Wolga","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19864,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rosa von Praunheim","original_name":"Rosa von Praunheim","popularity":0.2345,"profile_path":"/8KtgcbZmwtvyjATkPgGCD02GxPw.jpg","credit_id":"649303e943cd54012598cc5a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1139367","wikidata_id":"Q105267454","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
