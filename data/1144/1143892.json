Movies acted as an escape from day-to-day life, a parallel reality that reveled in sin and sensation. Teaching at the libertine San Francisco Art Institute from 1971–2011, Kuchar made numerous hot-blooded, Z-grade “classroom pictures” with his students. Several, including Club Vatican, Motel Capri and Evangelust, act as lascivious collective exorcisms of religious hypocrisy and sexual repression. Club Vatican is one of the most visually sumptuous of Kuchar’s classroom pictures, and was recently restored by the Harvard Film Archive (alongside other of Kuchar’s pedagogical free-for-alls). The frame is packed with visual stimulation and the film unfolds as a series of writhing tableaux depicting clergy and sinners alike in perverse Catholic rites. Kuchar called it “a meditation on religious upheaval via mental strife.” Starring Courtney Love!","popularity":0.3724,"poster_path":"/qtK3bBXH1H2zz1gepbKtegiZBqT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Club Vatican","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":7621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Courtney Love","original_name":"Courtney Love","popularity":0.5244,"profile_path":"/lIb3gMM1LoE53mHYnMWooBH4mDJ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6496676deb79c200e29e49a6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Kuchar","original_name":"George Kuchar","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/pFB8luGSfUrfmI8YUd1ulYGUzUB.jpg","credit_id":"64966749955c6500c7adf7c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0252332","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qtK3bBXH1H2zz1gepbKtegiZBqT.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
