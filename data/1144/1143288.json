The film was shot in Long Pengayan hamlet, at Apau Ping, the last settlement on the Bahau, and home to Oko’ (Grand-Mother) Asung Kiring. In the past, all Kenyah Leppo’ Ké women were potters, but today this is a dying craft, which is considered dirty work and therefore quite unpopular.","popularity":0.0553,"poster_path":"/sAKamtoStYkzW1kDmoCF72MQlJ2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Traditional Potter of Kalimantan (Borneo)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4124899,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernard Sellato","original_name":"Bernard Sellato","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6494453e9a358d0139dffef0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sAKamtoStYkzW1kDmoCF72MQlJ2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
