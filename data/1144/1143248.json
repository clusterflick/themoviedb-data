Following the migration journey and metamorphosis of the monarch butterflies, the short documentary Monarcas tells the story of two Guatemalan undocumented day laborers, Pedro and Alejandro, who migrated from Central America in search of a better future for their families, only to have their wages extorted by a Miami roofer. They seek help from a local organization and navigate the complexities of court proceedings to regain their dignity. In the process, they became activists and organizers, helping others like them to fight for their rights, despite their immigrant status.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/x8gSn0pNeC8brWDeKvBlTYXfLzx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monarcas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3481215,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Diana Larrea","original_name":"Diana Larrea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64941a0de22d280126052e4a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4124659,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Diana Larrea","original_name":"Diana Larrea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64941a4a6b5fc2012b20dc81","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4124660,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Diana Larrea","original_name":"Diana Larrea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64941a5f6b5fc2010a4d0224","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4124663,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mileydy Artiles","original_name":"Mileydy Artiles","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64941a8c9a358d00ac500a5f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4124667,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carlos Mejia","original_name":"Carlos Mejia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64941aaccfe48f00aca188df","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4124673,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Diana Larrea","original_name":"Diana Larrea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64941ade89b56100ad69a3da","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4124675,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Oolite Arts","original_name":"Oolite Arts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64941b06e22d2801453cc47d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x8gSn0pNeC8brWDeKvBlTYXfLzx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Miami Film Festival","release_date":"2023-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
