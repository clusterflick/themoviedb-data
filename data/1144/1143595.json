In 1966, on the eve of the 25th anniversary of the shootings, for the first time a small group of Kyivans, together with the famous writer Viktor Nekrasov, gathered near Babyn Yar to honor the memory of the victims. Employees of the Kyiv Documentary Film Studio found out about it: cameraman Eduard Timlin and director Rafail Nakhmanovych. Under the guise of shooting a film about the Soviet police, they decided to record this event on tape.","popularity":0.0512,"poster_path":"/hQwS1Ll2zqMce1JJ2a0gUEfthRE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92705,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ukrainian Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Filming in Babyn Yar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1872168,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Viktor Nekrasov","original_name":"Viktor Nekrasov","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/djX3TvBvVaKgdyyaA4KrI0yBT3Y.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"self (archival footage)","credit_id":"6495c29397eab40108537858","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4127219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Dziuba","original_name":"Іван Дзюба","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/iRsl0jRgFEYQxjWx4yVniJiirSv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"self (archival footage)","credit_id":"6495c2ce8805510144149436","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1366923,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Eduard Timlin","original_name":"Eduard Timlin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/lvZuGzaOHSp5zVhrW7PgKZDyWRb.jpg","credit_id":"64957ba0a284eb00ffe62014","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4126801,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rafail Nakhmanovych","original_name":"Rafail Nakhmanovych","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/31VKNeZZJTZaQ3Gv2WpuovCcLjI.jpg","credit_id":"6495820ba284eb011cdb94d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":818,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hQwS1Ll2zqMce1JJ2a0gUEfthRE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":545},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":818,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/peZYGFOidkfllsNLfNnhMYX32ZS.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":545}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1966-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
