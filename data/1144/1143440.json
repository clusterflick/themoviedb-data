From her high mountain village, 15-year-old Jeanne dreams of leaving her childhood orphanage and discovering the world. Fleeing to the city of lights, she finds refuge in a shed.

Fascinated by this cruel woman with a disturbing charm, both powerful and vulnerable, Jeanne becomes her protege and her confidante as the trap closes in on
