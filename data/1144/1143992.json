During the first fight in the arena, Spartacus wins over the Colloseum audience and his freedom. When freed from gladiator slavery, Spartacus calls slaves and Rome plebs for a rebel. The dictator Sulla dies. Spartacus and rebellious slaves lay out a camp near Vesuvius. The Roman commander Crassus is unable to take Spartacus’s camp by storm, so he lays siege to it. Spartacus is betrayed; he dies with his friend Artorix in a battle.  The film is based on Raffaello Giovagnoli’s novel of the same name.","popularity":0.1399,"poster_path":"/5hQ6NbgxDcl9mPjudSqHupX0VzR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25065,"logo_path":"/ugfX3cgasxoDtUjkmWqlthK4hja.png","name":"VUFKU","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet
