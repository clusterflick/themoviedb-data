Through interviews with Forest Service employees, loggers, environmentalists, scientists and politicians, we discover the ever-widening impact of current policy on the human and wildlife communities that depend upon the National Forests for survival. In 1905 the National Forest system was created to protect the remainder of the great woodland ecosystems that once covered America. Yet each year, more and more of these public forests have been sacrificed in the name of commerce. Everyone talks about finding the balance between preserving jobs and protecting the environment, but solutions are long in coming. While we debate, American taxpayers subsidize forest destruction to the tune of 300 million dollars each year.","popularity":1.381,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":202731,"logo_path":null,"name":"Miranda Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wilderness: The Last Stand","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Sarandon","original_name":"Susan Sarandon","popularity":2.5599,"profile_path":"/oHYYL8bNakAREaLUBtMul5uMG0A.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"6494b3ffd5ffcb00ffe7e282","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3277671,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ken Bailey","original_name":"Ken Bailey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6494b456391b9c0145235c24","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68616,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Zieff","original_name":"David Zieff","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6494b479391b9c00c996e031","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230987,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nathaniel Kahn","original_name":"Nathaniel Kahn","popularity":0.1546,"profile_path":"/bCmZu0MGfdCyIyD1OmJcgKVJ34E.jpg","credit_id":"6494b46ad236e600afad3d02","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1110644,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miranda Smith","original_name":"Miranda Smith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6494b43154508d00c7723803","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3681820,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Scott Elder Harper","original_name":"Scott Elder Harper","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6494b4ee97eab400ae021ab6","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3277671,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ken Bailey","original_name":"Ken Bailey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6494b518d236e600e47333bc","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1110645,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Abigail Wright","original_name":"Abigail Wright","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/9mq8kTQQw1qj1dXIAsNu02lMGoA.jpg","credit_id":"6494b4ff88055100ae1d40ed","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0358286","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":33577,"name":"environment"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Telluride MountainFilm Festival","release_date":"1993-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
