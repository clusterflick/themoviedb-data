The Roof of Brahah sits on a rise and reflects the rhythms of demiurgical chaos that echoes in the beastly echo of something dark within us. There are almost no words in the play, only spells, rituals, sacrifices. And this was all when there were no geese, and when the king was good, and the people - a dog ... The action lulls with its sinister rhythms, the darkness, introduces into a trance, and dark and sexual witches bring down the hypothetical children of King Macbeth. .  Scotland in a Ukrainian manner, a hypnotic, mystical ... beautiful and bleeding tragedy about power.","popularity":0.2313,"poster_path":"/vluxhkfgkppKSEJfDraSb9iuzd4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":202760,"logo_path":null,"name":"Centre Of Contemporary Art
