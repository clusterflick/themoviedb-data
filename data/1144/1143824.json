A little boy hunts rabbits, residents demand better electrical coverage at a town meeting, a woman waters the plants outside her house and a local radio station relays the day's happenings. At night, wildlife is captured on camera, along with strange bursts of light that momentarily illuminate a countryside criss-crossed with pylons and cables. And ever present is the insidious hum of electricity.","popularity":0.1575,"poster_path":"/pSLVKvP5JQCmWdW6WGoYkSml4Tt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2023-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Shadow of Light","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"In the Shadow of Light","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4127916,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Emilia Martín","original_name":"Emilia Martín","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64962d17955c6501444cf10c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1921470,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Javiera Velozo","original_name":"Javiera Velozo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64962d34eb79c2011c514914","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4127913,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isabel Reyes Bustos","original_name":"Isabel Reyes Bustos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64962ca762f3350108179154","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4127914,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ignacia Merino Bustos","original_name":"Ignacia Merino Bustos","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64962cc8b34409011c7ad08d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4127915,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"María Jose Díaz","original_name":"María Jose Díaz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64962ce4eb79c2011c51490b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4127917,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrea Millán","original_name":"Andréa Millán","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zshhPzLzMAvt1KZ4auOz5gwngyO.jpg","credit_id":"64962d4dbbd0b000adefe6f4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1307618,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Francisca Barraza","original_name":"Francisca Barraza","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64962cfd62f3350108179161","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pSLVKvP5JQCmWdW6WGoYkSml4Tt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":6460,"name":"chile"},{"id":287429,"name":"electricity"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"At Sheffield DocFest","release_date":"2023-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
