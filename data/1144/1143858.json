Fueled by the revolutionary fervor sweeping the nation, the strike soon turned into an uprising, leading to the extended occupation of the campus, classes being canceled, students being arrested, and the resignation of the college president. Through archival footage and modern-day interviews, we follow the studentsâ€™ struggle against the institutional racism that, for over a century, had shut out people of color from this and other public universities. The Five Demands revisits the untold story of this explosive student takeover, and proves that a handful of ordinary citizens can band together to take action and effect meaningful change.","popularity":0.2295,"poster_path":"/A7T3y4cJEelSPmN3thdgYqr8NgG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Five Demands","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":116799,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Greta Schiller","original_name":"Greta Schiller","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e74eb43768a73f8d919033","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1274415,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrea Weiss","original_name":"Andrea Weiss","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e74ec4e8211ecd22b0bd48","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26682174","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A7T3y4cJEelSPmN3thdgYqr8NgG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Pan African Fim Festival","release_date":"2023-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
