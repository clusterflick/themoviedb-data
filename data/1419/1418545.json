Российские добровольцы в Украине","overview":"A documentary by the Dossier Center tells the story of Russian volunteers who have joined Ukraine's side and are fighting for its liberation. In Russia, these individuals are labeled as terrorists: they have crossed into the Kursk and Belgorod regions armed and engaged in battles with the Russian army. These volunteers made a choice that severed ties with their families and friends. Dossier journalists traveled to the frontlines to explore what drives these Russians to take up arms against their compatriots. This film is not only a chronicle of the war in Ukraine but also an exploration of deep moral conflicts. It is a story of traitors, heroes, and their tragic futures.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Boys.
