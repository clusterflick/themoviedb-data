In a winged altarpiece that is 8 meters wide with the sides open, the master has created 460 individual figures that form groups of Christ's Passion. Brüggemann created the work to the glory of God - Ad Dei Honorem. The film conveys the experience of this work in a unique way. The camera recreates the Passion of the Lord, moves from station to station, dramatizes the Passion by focusing on the figures and involves the viewer directly. In addition, there is music by Ciboli and - during the Passion - Johann Sebastian Bach, which deepens the experience.","popularity":0.0289,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":216488,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alfred Ehrhardt-Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1949-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ad Dei Honorem: Hans Brüggemann’s Passion altar from 1521 in Schleswig Cathedral","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Ad dei honorem – Der große Brüggemann-Altar","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Ad Dei Honorem.
