Yeon-gyo walks through the canyons of the American Southwest under the blazing sun, relying only on the shadowy outline of the person in front of her.  As that figure becomes clearer, she is suddenly transported to a hospital corridor in Seoul where she was tiptoeing for her mom’s life and death and the backstage of a theater in Seoul where her ex-lover Ji-yeon once performed. Torn between forgetting and remembering, Yeon-gyo encounters a familiar nurse from the hospital working at a remote canyon motel. Like the relentless sun in the canyon, Yeon-gyo wishes the moments in Seoul would stretch into an endless summer, free from the constant waiting. In search of the meaning behind Ji-yeon’s words about finding dinosaur footprints, Yeon-gyo walks through the canyon of loss and discovery, struggling with grief.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":126575,"logo_path":"/81avcuOvF9fyQHyxSBrHdk7DVZO.png","name":"Seesaw Pictures","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Sea Pineapple","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3867836,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chae Yu","original_name":"유채정","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/kxO8RNAd2YTu67PvH68xO51ulC9.jpg","credit_id":"6789ca8fa64feb16c91d7057","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2519058,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kang Sarah","original_name":"Kang Sarah","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6789ca9929071c36ac97617c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
