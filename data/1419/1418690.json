The film shows how to construct a durable, concrete shelter suitable for surviving a nuclear blast; it was made in 1963 and presented by the Department of Defense. The basic premise of the film is that it follows Civil Defense Director Hank Adams as he guides the Warren Family through construction of their own basement fallout shelter. The original catalog entry for this movie noted that: \"This film is designed not only for those living in suburban or rural areas too far removed from the nearest community shelter-but also for those in urban sections who, for reasons of personal preference or convenience, would rather rely on a family shelter for fallout protection.\"","popularity":0.2392,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":44751,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vision Associates Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":113898,"logo_path":null,"name":"Department of Defense","origin_country":"US"},{"id":113520,"logo_path":null,"name":"Office of Civil Defense","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1963-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shelter on a Quiet Street","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2106,"name":"cold war"},{"id":158419,"name":"nuclear fallout"},{"id":211018,"name":"civil defense"},{"id":241542,"name":"public safety"},{"id":319579,"name":"public information film"},{"id":328268,"name":"fallout shelters"},{"id":331200,"name":"fallout"},{"id":345309,"name":"public safety film"},{"id":345319,"name":"fallout shelter"},{"id":345320,"name":"public information"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1963-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\" SHELTER ON A QUIET STREET \" 1963 CIVIL DEFENSE FILM   CONSTRUCTION OF HOME FALLOUT SHELTER XD13814","key":"aiG1WIRPaWo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-04-21T16:29:56.000Z","id":"678959251d4c91f6ac978606"}]}}}
