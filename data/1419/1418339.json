Due to a mixture of biblical and scientific reasons, an increasing number of evangelical scholars are beginning to deny the supernatural creation of Adam. This talk will look at these objections to Godâ€™s direct creation of the fully human man called Adam and then show why this view is crucial because of the implications on the doctrines of sin, salvation, and Christology.  Simon has written several articles for the Answers Research Journal and serves as general manager and primary speaker for AiG-UK. He conveys the vital importance of a committed stand on the book of Genesis and effectively calls the church back to the authority of the Word of God.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/brtB2O4hBzZGixv6FhdnOy70XSH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Best of British Bible and Science Conference","title":"Adam - The First and the Last","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5182131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Turpin","original_name":"Simon Turpin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"himself","credit_id":"6788771206809ab236ad1457","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":847,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/brtB2O4hBzZGixv6FhdnOy70XSH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":565}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
