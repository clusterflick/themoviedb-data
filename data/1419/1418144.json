They went 12-0 and, incredibly, traveled 2,500 miles by steam locomotive, playing an astonishing 5 games in 6 days. The story of the Sewanee Tigers and their season have all the hallmarks of fiction. Yet, as Sewanee Vice-Chancellor, John McCardell, has noted: \"It's more than lore -- it's true.\" Unrivaled chronicles the incredible story of the Iron Men of 1899 and their historic season. The saga is both gripping and inspiring and ranks as one of the greatest achievements in all of sports.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unrivaled: Sewanee 1899","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8789654","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
