I lived as if our father’s new wife was our real mother. My first name changed, we moved, I enrolled in a new school. My mother was a fallen woman never to be talked about. I could only stare at holes cut out of family photos, knowing it was her. Years later, now a filmmaker in France, I suddenly started having vertigo attacks that prevented me from working - my brain was deleting one of my eyes’ two images instead of merging them. As my world span, my thoughts returned to the blind spot in my existence: my mother. I learnt my father accused her of adultery, a crime in Korea until 2015. Sentenced to 8 months in jail, with no support from her family, she had to resign as a teacher and didn’t own a place to live. What was it like to be stamped an ill-reputed woman and shunned by 90’s Korean society?","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/uuYk7J7v4PbWYFSYHC2EgVk2q1p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126575,"logo_path":"/81avcuOvF9fyQHyxSBrHdk7DVZO.png","name":"Seesaw Pictures","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Sea, Star, Woman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3766133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeunghae Yim","original_name":"Jeunghae Yim","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6789d84a09c31daea4975bbe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uuYk7J7v4PbWYFSYHC2EgVk2q1p.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2r20tCgpV6uqdVnp1bUoyssD9xK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
