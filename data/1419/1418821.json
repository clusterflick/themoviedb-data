However, Jeong Rae who had to live as a foreigner in Germany, decided to return to his hometown in South Korea and open a chicken restaurant with his mother. I told him that I will start making a film or file for divorce. We both laughed, but we knew: this is serious. When we got married, we thought that love would overcome all the cultural differences between us, but the reality was not so easy. My parents, who consider Jeong Rae irresponsible for not having a proper job; my mother-in-law Sun Ja, who can't understand a single word I say; our daughter, Hannah, who just wants to have a \"regular“ family; and me, feeling jealous of the chicken that Jeong Rae is so passionate about.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":95997,"logo_path":null,"name":"Neufilm GmbH","origin_country":""},{"id":126575,"logo_path":"/81avcuOvF9fyQHyxSBrHdk7DVZO.png","name":"Seesaw Pictures","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Becoming Kim","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1703729,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susanne Kim","original_name":"Susanne Kim","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6789be923a43075f431d4dd5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1703729,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susanne Kim","original_name":"Susanne Kim","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6789be3994d95839f3ad478a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2761315,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Holm Taddiken","original_name":"Holm Taddiken","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6789be453a43075f431d4dae","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2519058,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kang Sarah","original_name":"Kang Sarah","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6789be4ce98081f582979d00","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1193271,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Emma Rosa Simon","original_name":"Emma Rosa Simon","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6789be583a43075f431d4db8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1352951,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marion Tuor","original_name":"Marion Tuor","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6789be6394d95839f3ad479d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1703729,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susanne Kim","original_name":"Susanne Kim","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6789be783a43075f431d4dcf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
