Focusing on dynamic and ephemeral dimensions of the cultural landscape, Strickland adopted the shorthand of “microcinema” to portray a collection of local characters and environmental transitions that would lend animate perspective to the Loire Valley World Heritage web site. Adding the glimpses together in a 27 minute movie, Allons-y Alonzo reflects a filmmaker’s quest to glean the senses of a place and to register its Genius Loci. The web site with Strickland’s video was produced as a design prototype for UNESCO World Heritage Centre.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/cly66v4YMbLtNUbvu31D0tHf1xV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Allons-Y Alonzo: Souvenirs of a Landscape","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2524641,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rachel Strickland","original_name":"Rachel Strickland","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678a15835e0fbbe3e9ad4149","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":1827,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cly66v4YMbLtNUbvu31D0tHf1xV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1222}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
