What secret memories do they hold of their departed loved ones? Who do they hold responsible for these deaths? And how do they view the world now? These are the heartfelt monologues of people who have endured the unthinkable yet still retain their capacity for compassion. In this moment, nothing is more important than their words. Over the two years of military action in Ukraine, the UN estimates that more than 10,000 civilians have died—and the shells continue to claim lives every day. Novaya journalists are unable to access Ukrainian territory due to censorship and cannot fully tell the stories of what is happening there.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":140048,"logo_path":null,"name":"Novaya Gazeta","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2024-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unbearably Loud","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Nevynosimo gromko","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2777307,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Artemyeva","original_name":"Анна Артемьева","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/5JG9eAik4EJ6e7rlwVRYnUC9hq1.jpg","credit_id":"678920501403701c991d54e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2777307,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Artemyeva","original_name":"Анна Артемьева","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/5JG9eAik4EJ6e7rlwVRYnUC9hq1.jpg","credit_id":"6789206a1403701c991d54f1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2777307,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Artemyeva","original_name":"Анна Артемьева","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/5JG9eAik4EJ6e7rlwVRYnUC9hq1.jpg","credit_id":"67892070e98081f582978461","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5183262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Zhilin","original_name":"Иван Жилин","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678920801403701c991d5501","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5183262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Zhilin","original_name":"Иван Жилин","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6789209eb9d1d10ef1978cc8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
