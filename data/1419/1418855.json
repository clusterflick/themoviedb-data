Not only is she bullied at school because her father is Chinese, but she also struggles with academic stress due to her mother’s obsession with education. Although SAN grapples with the harsh reality, her resilience shines through her secret ritual: observing her neighbor/best friend, HA-JIN, through binoculars before bed. She is not the only one who finds solace through her neighbors. CHAO, SAN’s father, who suffers from a deteriorating relationship with his wife, who wants a divorce, also finds an unusual companionship with HAJIN’s mother, YUMI, who is open-minded and free-spirited. One day, SAN accidentally witnesses a shocking crime taking place at HAJIN’s home through her binoculars.","popularity":0.0512,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":126575,"logo_path":"/81avcuOvF9fyQHyxSBrHdk7DVZO.png","name":"Seesaw Pictures","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Seoulers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3036798,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pyun Hee-young","original_name":"변희영","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6789dec606809ab236ad46cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3036800,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jiajun 'Oscar' Zhang","original_name":"Jiajun 'Oscar' Zhang","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/ybw78n2bWEAEn9K7l7Xv1nHsXWu.jpg","credit_id":"6789ded2c9e03e442d976a27","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
