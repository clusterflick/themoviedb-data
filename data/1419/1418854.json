A child soldier from South Sudan turned Harvard graduate and democracy activist, Peter is forced to reconcile his commitment to his young country versus his young family, to nonviolent means versus whatever it takes, and a self-defined identity versus an inherited one as protector and leader of his people. We witness the family's personal and intergenerational costs but also their resilience as Peter makes choices which ultimately leads to his incarceration as a criminal in the US.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":126575,"logo_path":"/81avcuOvF9fyQHyxSBrHdk7DVZO.png","name":"Seesaw Pictures","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"SS","name":"South Sudan"},{"iso_3166_1":"KE","name":"Kenya"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Seeds of a Nation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5184690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Kyung-eun","original_name":"Lee Kyung-eun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6789dd248677bdfadfad4736","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5184692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Biar Ajak","original_name":"Peter Biar Ajak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6789de0ec9e03e442d9769a2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5184690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Kyung-eun","original_name":"Lee Kyung-eun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6789dce138920393ad1d6458","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2159068,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Oh Hee-jung","original_name":"오희정","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6789dcf5c9e03e442d97696b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2057197,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lucinda Englehart","original_name":"Lucinda Englehart","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6789dcff29071c36ac97653c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
