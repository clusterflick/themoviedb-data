Some of the areas discussed in this nuclear war drama are the safety plan, regular inspections, supervised public entry into shelters, ventilation, first aid, sanitation, fire prevention, decontamination of personnel, and more.  \"Shelter living is different,\" the Manager states, \"But we have a trained staff that will make your stay in this shelter livable for us all.\"","popularity":0.5265,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":113520,"logo_path":null,"name":"Office of Civil Defense","origin_country":""},{"id":113898,"logo_path":null,"name":"Department of Defense","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1963-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Public Shelter Organization and Staff","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2106,"name":"cold war"},{"id":3275,"name":"nuclear radiation"},{"id":10349,"name":"survival"},{"id":158419,"name":"nuclear fallout"},{"id":211018,"name":"civil defense"},{"id":241542,"name":"public safety"},{"id":319579,"name":"public information film"},{"id":328268,"name":"fallout shelters"},{"id":331200,"name":"fallout"},{"id":345309,"name":"public safety film"},{"id":345319,"name":"fallout shelter"},{"id":345320,"name":"public information"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1963-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\" PUBLIC FALLOUT SHELTER ORGANIZATION AND STAFF \"  1963 COLD WAR / NUCLEAR CIVIL DEFENSE FILM  29082","key":"1WxN9PmehLU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-04-24T00:21:37.000Z","id":"678952849de8a2d8349792f3"}]}}}
