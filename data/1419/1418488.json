This is their first meeting. Lucie Manette, a young woman who has been raised as an orphan and a ward of Tellson's bank, has learned that her father is alive and has recently been released from prison after eighteen years of unjust incarceration. She is traveling to the French suburb of Saint Antoine with Mr. Jarvis Lorry, a longtime Tellson's employee who had managed her father's affairs before his imprisonment. They find her father at the home of Ernest Defarge, a former domestic of Dr. Manette's who has housed the doctor since his release. Though her father is teetering on the brink of insanity, she solemnly vows that she will be true to him and devote her life to helping him recover himself.","popularity":0.0968,"poster_path":"/rkNIxf1LLoMqO0GJ85njpJS3VRe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Tale of Two Cities","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2425405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jun Sena","original_name":"瀬奈じゅん","popularity":0.214,"profile_path":"/p7BzfdNTbzpRXZYvTtbIi0slCCE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Sydney Carton","credit_id":"6789041ce98081f582977ee8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2763675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ayabuki Mao","original_name":"Ayabuki Mao","popularity":0.1235,"profile_path":"/vURP7V1EwlZzS0br2CnQyhG6m70.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Charles Darnay","credit_id":"6789043a8677bdfadfad273d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3398411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sakurano Ayane","original_name":"Sakurano Ayane","popularity":0.0809,"profile_path":"/3necFOS5w7eSuhBpNicgnPQTo9t.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lucie Manette","credit_id":"6789045be98081f582977f02","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4994963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oota Tetsunori","original_name":"Oota Tetsunori","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6789047c1403701c991d4ecc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cJIW78NLWAceopfaI0BuydALiiR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rkNIxf1LLoMqO0GJ85njpJS3VRe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":276810,"name":"takarazuka"},{"id":284843,"name":"takarazuka revue"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2003-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
