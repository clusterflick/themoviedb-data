The production emphasizes aspects of the original drama, heightening the erotic atmosphere of the cigar factory and Carmen's wild spirit, and including a spectacular on-stage horse. The sensational choreography closely depicts the storyline of Prosper Mérimée's original novella in a production that was hailed by critics as a triumph. The Corpo di Ballo of the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma shines in this production, with Principal Dancers including Rebecca Bianchi in the role of Carmen, Amar Ramasar as Don Jose, and Alessio Rezza dancing the part of Lucas.","popularity":0.1813,"poster_path":"/UXIJs6GxtoECn7XmOL8ozp9t69.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/gKP4egMJOi5rksdnplfPV1wa0sd.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carmen: A Ballet in Two Acts","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/UXIJs6GxtoECn7XmOL8ozp9t69.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10551,"name":"ballet"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
