In this experimental short from artist and filmmaker Lisa Freeman, frenetic camerawork and quickfire editing convey the bodyâ€™s lacklustre requirement to always be working in our capitalist society. Using glimpses of concrete environments, bodies on treadmills, crash-test dummies, and other ubiquitous urban images, and melding these with a soundscape of ragged breathing and disjointed conversations, Hook, Spill, Cry Your Eyes Out provides a cutting commentary on what our society inflates with importance.","popularity":0.2427,"poster_path":"/9fYtlNPpketqi8Vb5ViPIrB6ONZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hook, Spill, Cry Your Eyes Out","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4151514,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa Freeman","original_name":"Lisa Freeman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6788a419b9d1d10ef19778d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4151514,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa Freeman","original_name":"Lisa Freeman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6788a4212ba9fb7c5ead21b9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4151514,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa Freeman","original_name":"Lisa Freeman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6788a427e98081f582977037","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4151514,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa Freeman","original_name":"Lisa Freeman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6788a42e45f296f6011d3896","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4151514,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa Freeman","original_name":"Lisa Freeman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6788a4385e0fbbe3e9ad13a6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4151514,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa Freeman","original_name":"Lisa Freeman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6788a45c45f296f6011d38d1","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4151514,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa Freeman","original_name":"Lisa Freeman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6788a46ce98081f58297706b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":729,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jaYI0ltSG9LuckoMN9sh7nbimcW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1296}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2829,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9fYtlNPpketqi8Vb5ViPIrB6ONZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ARC MA show Unassembled","release_date":"2020-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2025-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
