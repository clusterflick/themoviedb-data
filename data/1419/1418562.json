Someone left their home a long time ago, someone immediately after February 24th in 2022, and someone stayed in Russia. On the first eve of the anniversary of the war in 2023, at the author’s request, the participants sent a video of what life looks like around them. They decided for themselves what was important for them to talk about now: about the war or about life. They decided what to show and how. This is a kaleidoscope of different events of one day, during which everyone is trying to understand how life has changed and what it has become now. The goal of the film was to give the voices of the participants the opportunity to be heard without evaluation or condemnation.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"}],"release_date":"2024-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Borderline","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2777292,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darya Budanova","original_name":"Дарья Буданова","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678923fc9de8a2d834978ad4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2777292,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darya Budanova","original_name":"Дарья Буданова","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678924052ba9fb7c5ead3863","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5183305,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrey Tyulenev","original_name":"Андрей Тюленев","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678924159de8a2d834978ae3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-12-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
