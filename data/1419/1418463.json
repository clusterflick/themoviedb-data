He finds treasures to put in his backpack. Exploration and treasures. This is what makes the collector work. But off the roads. In dark places. There are frequencies, underground forces that make the movement.  In one of these places lives a woman in black. She repairs porcelain dolls. But there is a doll, who gives off something, with her glass eyes. Those eyes that never blink.  The woman in black can no longer stand this look, she puts the doll in the box of oblivion. Thrown away the box, thrown into black space. In the darkness that improves existence to breathing in the shadows. But the box is found by the collector.  Buried, nailed, sealed, but found the box. In the backpack the doll.  And the forces set in motion, the frequencies lead the collector towards unexplored regions.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":250385,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tutella Prod","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2024-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anima","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3240234,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rémy Dumont","original_name":"Rémy Dumont","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6788f39d1403701c991d4989","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5182862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Grieci","original_name":"Anne Grieci","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6788f3ae9de8a2d834977ff2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5182863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Romain Dardet","original_name":"Romain Dardet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6788f3ba947b19f78b978288","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5182864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Midonnet","original_name":"Sophie Midonnet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6788f3c5947b19f78b978294","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5182865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emmanuel Drouhard","original_name":"Emmanuel Drouhard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6788f3cf06809ab236ad253b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2819541,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Menut","original_name":"Charles Menut","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6788f35606809ab236ad24f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2819541,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Menut","original_name":"Charles Menut","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6788f38d06809ab236ad2522","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hallucinea Film Festival","release_date":"2024-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sinister Horror film festival","release_date":"2024-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
