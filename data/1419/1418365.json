A rarely shown sensorial experience.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Furyu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550944,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Kiyoshi Awazu","original_name":"粟津潔","popularity":0.1142,"profile_path":"/nh2TM8W7kUawG7d3hC4Co1poPOw.jpg","credit_id":"67889a675e0fbbe3e9ad138e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550944,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Kiyoshi Awazu","original_name":"粟津潔","popularity":0.1142,"profile_path":"/nh2TM8W7kUawG7d3hC4Co1poPOw.jpg","credit_id":"67889b56947b19f78b97723e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":729,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sFL7QOKqedmOcRScls0oZj2kW9l.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1296}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2025-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
