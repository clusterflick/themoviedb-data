We meet six protagonists, all from Perm, who opposed the war against Ukraine. Half of them have moved abroad, while the other half remain in Russia. Those who left are learning to live anew, discovering a new world of freedom. Those who stayed are adapting to a new reality of denial and collective silence. Yet, each of them continues to resist Putin's dictatorship in their own way.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"},{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","name":"Kazakhstan"}],"release_date":"2024-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just Around The Corner","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5183232,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Sovina","original_name":"Мария Совина","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67891e7c55e49bed5e9786c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5183232,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Sovina","original_name":"Мария Совина","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67891ea106809ab236ad2b48","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5183232,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Sovina","original_name":"Мария Совина","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67891eb69de8a2d834978a1b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5183239,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ellie Plokhina","original_name":"Элли Плохина","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67891ec655e49bed5e9786e1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5183241,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sergey Ukhov","original_name":"Сергей Ухов","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67891ef9b9d1d10ef1978c39","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
