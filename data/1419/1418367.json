Once scarcely seen in central Europe, shaggy 300 kg brown bears, are once again padding through Slovenia's Alpine forests and crossing borders into Austria and Italy. In these limestone ranges within sight of the warm Mediterranean, they hardly ever come into conflict with people - unless they sense the presence of honey. This film opens our eyes to bears' enormous power, intelligent curiosity and surprising habits: some bears hibernate with bats that huddle together and even mate in their cave, unfazed by the slumbering giant beneath. Biological research tells us the brown bear is an infallible indicator of intact biospheres: Where this top predator settles, other species thrive: from large mammals like wolves and lynx, to altogether humbler residents like mushrooms, or the Carnic honeybees. And as forests reclaim fields left fallow by the rural exodus, is this a chance for bears too?","popularity":0.1109,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":104385,"logo_path":"/tE03VmXndXHHNAeUGjvzTxTZIeu.png","name":"DreiD.at","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":3391,"logo_path":"/t0QBs2fI3mE3HxgoH1n39bYuzNu.png","name":"ORF","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der
