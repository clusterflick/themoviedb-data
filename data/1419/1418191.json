The artistry of international performers is combined with the native tradition of drumming and dancing offering a wider appreciation for the Innu way of life. Tricksters features Beni Malone's Wonderbolt Circus, as well as two time world champion hoop dancer Lisa Odjig who interacts with Innu Elders and children in workshops. Interviews with Innu elders inspire a greater appreciation for the Innu way of life. Tricksters offers an emergence of art and native culture, rarely seen on the screen.","popularity":0.2098,"poster_path":"/vZJBmeWpn4Mnl4BCMYbxcCf3t5z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":250308,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fire Crown
