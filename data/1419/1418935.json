We see a circus show in which one titular trick follows the next. However, not only acrobats are involved, but also a number of animals that have long since been banned from circus rings. These images are juxtaposed with the director's questions about people, the environment and politics, allowing for a range of interpretations that are up to the viewer.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tricks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3034519,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Luise Lehner","original_name":"Marie Luise Lehner","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678a199bc2470fc60bad05d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
