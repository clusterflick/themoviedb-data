With the sensational Ana Laguna in the title role, Mats Ek’s interpretation of the ballet classic has all the whimsy and imaginative innovation so closely associated with the choreographer. In this version of Giselle, the traditional romantic Rhineland village is replaced by a landscape in the shape of breasts, and the supernatural realm of the Wilis is replaced by the harsh reality of a lunatic asylum giving this interpretation a harsh modern relevance. Ana Laguna dances superbly as the barefoot girl who falls ‘madly in love’.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/iBHqgb7VEYFVkaaFFHFmbvsfNIZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38242,"logo_path":null,"name":"RM Arts","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":79568,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arthaus Musik","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mats Ek's Giselle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Giselle","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2037873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Laguna","original_name":"Ana Laguna","popularity":0.0513,"profile_path":"/qK2Ev2TS7hhB39jm15fhkYzD5Uj.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Giselle","credit_id":"67882f7838920393ad1d2171","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5181746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luc Bouy","original_name":"Luc Bouy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Albrecht","credit_id":"678831238677bdfadfad02cc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1663562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yvan Auzely","original_name":"Yvan Auzely","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":"/wFzj0j24bwvvBUHiPqcuMJLz81S.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Hilarion","credit_id":"6788313455e49bed5e976336","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5181749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vanessa McIntosh","original_name":"Vanessa McIntosh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Bathilde","credit_id":"67883164947b19f78b9764ab","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1578235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lena Wennergren","original_name":"Lena Wennergren","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Myrtha","credit_id":"67883174947b19f78b9764b5","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1870365,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mats Ek","original_name":"Mats Ek","popularity":0.1161,"profile_path":"/oYQlrL7wPdN98IJjnzmDjpxXdyu.jpg","credit_id":"67882fd238920393ad1d21ae","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1152381,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Måns Reuterswärd","original_name":"Måns Reuterswärd","popularity":0.109,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6788308779cf13ee41ad0583","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1314349,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richard Bonynge","original_name":"Richard Bonynge","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":"/eefHCTGyDoLGFeAYhtzcmHbCUyb.jpg","credit_id":"6788309b1d4c91f6ac975c2d","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1080796,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie-Louise Ekman","original_name":"Marie-Louise Ekman","popularity":0.0613,"profile_path":"/ieKtEQeeZRaAs6Ll3oqzKlsJ2SK.jpg","credit_id":"678830f588c55856d51d2bba","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1318392,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Adolphe Adam","original_name":"Adolphe Adam","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/iAPu7mp7neRaL7ZvPGJrVX1lYXv.jpg","credit_id":"678831e91d4c91f6ac975cc9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A94azwqthYjt8BfJHo1wqTZeaXn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iBHqgb7VEYFVkaaFFHFmbvsfNIZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
