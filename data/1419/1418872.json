The Canadian Pacific steamer had left Skagway, Alaska, on October 23, 1918, on its way to Vancouver, when a fierce blizzard hit. The ship veered off course and ran aground on a reef. Despite the proximity of several other ships, the harsh weather prevented any evacuation attempt. Almost 48 hours later, the Sophia slipped off the reef and sank. The following morning, rescue ships faced the terrible evidence: only the tip of its mast was visible. None of the 353 passengers and crewmembers survived.  Archival photos, 3D animation, exclusive interviews and underwater photography relate an important chapter of maritime history, while vividly portraying a place and time.","popularity":0.2581,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":121393,"logo_path":null,"name":"Merlin Films","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sinking of the Princess Sophia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2457463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luc Pilon","original_name":"Luc Pilon","popularity":0.078,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Narration","credit_id":"6789ebe993f742cc29ad0559","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5184754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph D'Urso","original_name":"Joseph D'Urso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Additional Voice","credit_id":"6789ec03a64feb16c91d7530","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3456158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ron O'Brien","original_name":"Ron O'Brien","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Additional Voice","credit_id":"6789ec1ca64feb16c91d7544","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5184757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allan Lento","original_name":"Allan Lento","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Additional Voice","credit_id":"6789ec2fc9e03e442d976d40","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1628402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabelle Pagé","original_name":"Isabelle Pagé","popularity":0.0592,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Additional Voice","credit_id":"6789ec42c2470fc60bacfef3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5184759,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yves Bérubé","original_name":"Yves Bérubé","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Dramatic Reenactment","credit_id":"6789ec6ec9e03e442d976d69","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5184760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Blanchet","original_name":"Marc Blanchet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Dramatic Reenactment","credit_id":"6789ec8322f810f7f9975b07","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3177072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alain Essiembre","original_name":"Alain Essiembre","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Dramatic Reenactment","credit_id":"6789ec9b22f810f7f9975b1c","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5184761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Farrel","original_name":"Charles Farrel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Dramatic Reenactment","credit_id":"6789ecbec2470fc60bacff1f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3447836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Lemieux","original_name":"Philippe Lemieux","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Dramatic Reenactment","credit_id":"6789ecd4c9e03e442d976d9c","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4639017,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Danielle Paré","original_name":"Danielle Paré","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Dramatic Reenactment","credit_id":"6789ece8c2470fc60bacff33","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1301504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yvon Roy","original_name":"Yvon Roy","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":"/Ap2JhFRkwtbhEWAlDhZhx8hRiVk.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Dramatic Reenactment","credit_id":"6789ed00c2470fc60bacff45","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5184766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Pierre Vallée","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Vallée","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Dramatic Reenactment","credit_id":"6789ed17c2470fc60bacff5d","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5184767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Syd Locke","original_name":"Syd Locke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Interviewee","credit_id":"6789ed2845f296f6011d65da","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5184770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty O'Keefe","original_name":"Betty O'Keefe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Interviewee","credit_id":"6789ed3dc2470fc60bacffa1","order":14},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5184774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian MacDonald","original_name":"Ian MacDonald","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Interviewee","credit_id":"6789ed5d22f810f7f9975b77","order":15}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2374611,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michel T.
