Liz agrees to participate in Jaime's experiment, creator of a technology that allows you to relive this emotion through lucid memories. Immersed in the experience, Liz enters a spiral of memories and revelations from her past with Roni, her late husband, which turns her against Jaime. In an acid criticism of new technologies and the lack of empathy, the plot is poetic, mysterious, full of suspense and touches of horror, with characters who fight for lost love.","popularity":0.2446,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":129,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The World I Know No Longer Exists","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eduardo Moscovis","original_name":"Eduardo Moscovis","popularity":0.3136,"profile_path":"/vRIEz0KKxwO63ULtKhDkPWji9wU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6788f9268677bdfadfad24bd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":59321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucy Ramos","original_name":"Lucy Ramos","popularity":0.3105,"profile_path":"/w3swZPROTdL6kSVJC1F2HTX7SDz.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6788f92d38920393ad1d407c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1277129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thiago Luciano","original_name":"Thiago Luciano","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/eiBeyrrnWjk80ggAqSOfpginoWT.jpg","credit_id":"6788f8e1947b19f78b9784e6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1277129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thiago Luciano","original_name":"Thiago Luciano","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/eiBeyrrnWjk80ggAqSOfpginoWT.jpg","credit_id":"6788f8eb947b19f78b978512","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1277130,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beto Schultz","original_name":"Beto Schultz","popularity":0.0814,"profile_path":"/zzqpKO4HJQJtQHFoOvAcNitRyUC.jpg","credit_id":"6788f90588c55856d51d4a58","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3404262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Domingos Meira","original_name":"Domingos Meira","popularity":0.1279,"profile_path":"/9zAP0xCdLzkYycaspjHEK8SV4SB.jpg","credit_id":"6788f91288c55856d51d4a5d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
