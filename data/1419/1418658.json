The film follows them from the gentle ambience of a dinner conversation, to their studios – where we are given insight into the way that each artist works – to some of their finished works and installations. What emerges is how very differently these two highly successful South African artists approach image making. Dumas’ method is deeply intuitive – she often works on the floor as though embracing her paintings, pouring and dabbing paint to produce her remarkable portraits. Kentridge is intensely systematic, alternating gestural mark making with the repetitive action of drawing-filming-erasing for his animated films.","popularity":0.2338,"poster_path":"/oCLeiEOfpRzQEB14ZypZVHBCilf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The two South African artists speak frankly about their work, their studio practice, their inspirations, and the challenges of success.","title":"Kentridge and Dumas in Conversation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1249069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marlene Dumas","original_name":"Marlene Dumas","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Marlene Dumas","credit_id":"67894ab38677bdfadfad369f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1075458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Kentridge","original_name":"William Kentridge","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/e5wLYqybCfMJdCr5vTZ4SDxedpc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67fbfc5eec22ba3b49d956f1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5183694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Catherine Meyburgh","original_name":"Catherine Meyburgh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67894a2b79cf13ee41ad3290","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1494776","wikidata_id":"Q76488766","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":883,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oCLeiEOfpRzQEB14ZypZVHBCilf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":589}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3644,"name":"south africa"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":166676,"name":"contemporary art"},{"id":345316,"name":"william kentridge"},{"id":345317,"name":"marlene dumas"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"KENTRIDGE AND DUMAS IN CONVERSATION Trailer","key":"RSOAamUpIKM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2023-01-10T17:16:44.000Z","id":"6789497e79cf13ee41ad31d8"}]}}}
