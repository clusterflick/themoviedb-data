A group of puppeteers are transformed by their experience of \"being buffalo\" at night under the stars. Amethyst First Rider tells the puppeteers, \"You are the buffalo. With each movement of your hands, each connection, you're creating energy & they become a part of you.\"  In 2017 history was made when bison were reintroduced to Banff National Park where they continue to roam free today. The project was part of the historic Buffalo Treaty, with over 40 First Nation signatories, who are part of the movement to bring buffalo back to their ancestral lands.  Leroy Little Bear & Amethyst First Rider lead this movement, & since Amethyst is first & foremost an artist, she wanted to celebrate the return of the buffalo through art. She met master puppeteer, Pete Balkwill, who was working with sculptural lantern puppets with his collaborators that lent themselves to night time performances on the land","popularity":0.2169,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":196690,"logo_path":null,"name":"TELUS originals","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2024-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"Iniskim- Return of the Buffalo\" is an intercultural artistic response to the return of the buffalo, as wild animals, to Western North America.","title":"Iniskim -
