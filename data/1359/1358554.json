From these 'guests of Verdi,’ age 77 to 107, comprised of international opera singers, ballet dancers, musicians, conductors and composers, we hear an extraordinary array of personal and professional stories filled with music, magic and passion, and ultimately learn why Verdi called this remarkable home his “best work.” A blueprint for retirement homes, Verdi’s generous approach in caring for his colleagues in art, and the energy from the intergenerational exchange that permeates the house, makes Casa Verdi as forward thinking now, as it was then.","popularity":0.1097,"poster_path":"/yB3oxmbZZhRavP2ZNM6mBlyqmtt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":241508,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Monte Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":26953,"logo_path":null,"name":"SimonSays Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":241509,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wanbli","origin_country":""},{"id":153886,"logo_path":"/wcOgb8591a6a506L1bUqxEiRv1B.png","name":"Foothill Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":66478,"logo_path":"/u7WmMkfo9MqsqfD5cuDAbd0u1qY.png","name":"Artemis Rising","origin_country":"US"},{"id":176799,"logo_path":"/oaclGxyfn94yNVsKaKrvteu9h7C.png","name":"The Harnisch Foundation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Viva Verdi!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1573955,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudio Giombi","original_name":"Claudio Giombi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67caa5e2dba14916062b4a7d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1384726,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yvonne Russo","original_name":"Yvonne Russo","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66eb8b385168a896e11fc4a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1147955,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Regina K.
