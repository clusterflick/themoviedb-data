Featuring former New York Times food columnist Mark Bittman, the film chronicles generations of profit-driven conglomerates manipulating our food system, destroying ecosystems, and exacerbating climate change. Industry insiders detail the roadmap for today’s corporate dominance. Simultaneously, slaughterhouse laborers fight for justice against relentless worker abuse. Others, like Paige and Derrick Jackson, have lost trust in the system, radically changing their lives to raise their own food. Committed to rebuilding our perpetually broken meat industry, Minnesota farmer Reginaldo Haslett-Marroquin begins to graze his chickens using an indigenous technique. The effects are a revelation.","popularity":0.2805,"poster_path":"/jZ0yLTTAXPiIoc30dWy2b2CgmVa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Jungle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1615382,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Wechsler","original_name":"Matt Wechsler","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66eb8f69e43f07de82eb675d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33376589","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jZ0yLTTAXPiIoc30dWy2b2CgmVa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1728}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15178,"name":"food industry"},{"id":254781,"name":"climate change activism"},{"id":289753,"name":"meat industry"},{"id":338852,"name":"food industry lobbying"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Woodstock Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
