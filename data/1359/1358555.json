Troll Storm is the story of a Jewish woman in Montana, Tanya Gersh, who was the victim of an unrelenting social media campaign of antisemitism and her decision to fight back in court. “The second I decided to fight, I started to heal,” she says in this powerful film. And although the crux of this story takes place several years ago, the new swarm of antisemitism currently crossing our country makes this story feel extremely relevant. Gersh uses interviews with a holocaust survivor as a brutal reminder of where we could end up again if this culture of hate is not faced by our country. In Accept the Call (WFF 2019) director Eunice Lau’s latest film, the parallel between Europe before the rise of the Nazi party and what happened to Gersh is frightening. – Sabina Barach","popularity":0.315,"poster_path":"/1pyA9SaEgTbtYeZDVNbtLjgJ7wX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Troll Storm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2431432,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eunice Lau","original_name":"Eunice Lau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66eb8b9862c4bb18c9746c6c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31012816","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tjqzA3dMwG2qezSeejQbeCJhzI4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2963,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ayjeF4FHiCZ1Z7TGAsw8YhUKiGd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1pyA9SaEgTbtYeZDVNbtLjgJ7wX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
