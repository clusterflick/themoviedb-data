Set against the backdrop of suburban Massachusetts, the film captures how this extraordinary camp community transforms our world into the fantasy realm of Sidleterra, where they battle villains from the writings of Homer and Lewis Carroll. As each of them invents and role plays as their camp characters, they unearth revelations about their identities, which they gradually carry to the real world.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hero Camp!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
