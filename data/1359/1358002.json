Fun-D-Mmental filmmaking is a genre of my making. The 'D' stands for 'Documentary,' the 'MENTAL' stands for 'experiMENTAL,' and the 'FUN' stands for the thrilling experience I create for the audience--for 'JUICE' is all of these things. And the word 'fundamental' is a variant on my expression of 'pure cinema.' A specialist in filming moving textures from real world situations, I journeyed to Las Vegas with an HD camera to capture pure energy--JUICE. With my paints--the images--I synthesized a digital dream and scored the avant-garde electronic music soundtrack to match the intensity and inner-stellar beauty of the piece. 'JUICE' is singular, unforgettable, and visceral in every way.","popularity":0.0377,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Juice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2642393,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian Zahm","original_name":"Brian Zahm","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e9c91a82ff873f7d1ee3c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1642245","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
