The film tells the entire story using a subjective camera, experiencing what happens from Gregor's perspective, as Kafka himself wanted it to be according to his own diary. It was shot with a 360 degree spherical remote controlled robotic camera that was directed and programmed to interact with the actors and to create an extremely low- angle view of the set as envisioned from the insect's 1st person perspective. Beyond the film/DVD release this method offers several interactive features available on-line, on interactive DVD and in the form of an art installations.  —Barnabas Takacs","popularity":0.1507,"poster_path":"/k1JdYWxMnl9gkmkRlOZz0FmrUHR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":239438,"logo_path":null,"name":"PanoCAST","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-12-19","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Metamorphosis: Immersive Kafka","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4951565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gyorgy Balogh","original_name":"Gyorgy Balogh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66ec4e5d3562807300fa7e79","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4951566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Éva Bata","original_name":"Éva Bata","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66ec4e643562807300fa7e83","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4951567,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ferenc Elek","original_name":"Ferenc Elek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66ec4e74fee2d55381fa7efc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4951568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Attila Janosi","original_name":"Attila Janosi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66ec4e87fee2d55381fa7f0b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4951569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samuel Kardos","original_name":"Samuel Kardos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66ec4e94065b70b54232574f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4951570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Petra Korosi","original_name":"Petra Korosi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66ec4eb995ef84e3ec325624","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4951571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Piroska Mészáros","original_name":"Piroska Mészáros","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"66ec4ec3e08b18d3aafa7f37","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4951572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandor Pali","original_name":"Sandor Pali","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"66ec4ed06868c7449546bf55","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4951573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janos Toth","original_name":"Janos Toth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"66ec4edde08b18d3aafa7f52","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4951574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zsófia Vesztl","original_name":"Zsófia Vesztl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"66ec4ee8e08b18d3aafa7f69","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1042220,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sándor Kardos","original_name":"Sándor Kardos","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/bKPAl5B1naXq1AP0LHrZgEtzMTm.jpg","credit_id":"66ec4f4519e6f27f0546bfb6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1042220,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sándor Kardos","original_name":"Sándor Kardos","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/bKPAl5B1naXq1AP0LHrZgEtzMTm.jpg","credit_id":"66ec4f5c6868c7449546bfb4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1830198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabor Nemeth","original_name":"Gabor Nemeth","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/e38GBwncd82XPkIMoK1zJLw5Wbp.jpg","credit_id":"66ec4f7b065b70b5423257b1","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1667844","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"hu","file_path":"/k1JdYWxMnl9gkmkRlOZz0FmrUHR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hu","note":"","release_date":"2010-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
