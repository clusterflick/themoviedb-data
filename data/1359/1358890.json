Torn from an idyllic life with a loving extended family in 1960's Alabama, young Johnny Turnipseed found himself in Minnesota with a father he no longer recognized, and empty cupboards. AB Turnipseed's alcoholism started a chain reaction of poverty, violence, addiction and despair that nearly destroyed three generations. From lost and frightened little boy to gang leader, drug dealer and pimp, to one of the nation's most respected pioneers of community restoration, this is a story of transformation and restoration told with honesty, and contagious hope.","popularity":0.4646,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Turnipseed: Legacy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lawrence Gilliard Jr.","original_name":"Lawrence Gilliard Jr.","popularity":0.7245,"profile_path":"/p4dVX4Svzu0zDqMgvAbsA1PDpMP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"John Turnipseed","credit_id":"66ec75083562807300fa8a31","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3914434,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norm Johnson","original_name":"Norm Johnson","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/lusVNRCnCBHZcgywyzEdTNL4TVE.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"John Jr.","credit_id":"66ec7516373c0ccc9cfa8e48","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1224615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michelle Paress","original_name":"Michelle Paress","popularity":0.1053,"profile_path":"/mYx45oLbz8jQ9BacTLkq9lBPo3u.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lawyer","credit_id":"66ec7521373c0ccc9cfa8e59","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1152021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keston John","original_name":"Keston John","popularity":0.4829,"profile_path":"/zEqkvuCDDgiErHg3XNyoG5TulUg.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Andre","credit_id":"66ec752d19e6f27f0546c91e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Rautenbach","original_name":"Frank Rautenbach","popularity":0.3428,"profile_path":"/4RD0mKgjdChuWc4yEKwv6oOCsYi.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Art","credit_id":"66ec754add8b3a03f93263d4","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4943048,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joby Harris","original_name":"Joby Harris","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ec73a87f6fca461632636e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2116098,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nathan Scoggins","original_name":"Nathan Scoggins","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":"/1pJyaeWS00BLwJUpoZ8K1HoXWjA.jpg","credit_id":"66ec73b13d29e1389646c810","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4952060,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ralph Linhardt","original_name":"Ralph Linhardt","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ec86a6065b70b542326f79","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3760400","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.782,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ytWio5sIsHfWNYMrQ6Bn69c1fjH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1283}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11436,"name":"redemption"},{"id":41508,"name":"grace"},{"id":156121,"name":"ex-con"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Turnipseed Legacy Trailer","key":"jjvTNxoZ8kA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-09-03T21:58:31.000Z","id":"672e889d1abc957ef41ba48d"}]}}}
