This utopian dream has its source in the relationship between the main character and her twin sister - actress Melania. The process of Antonina creating an innovative bridge design has an intense impact on sisterly bonds. The twinship described is a balancing act between a state of euphoria and love and a state of powerlessness and hatred. The strange dynamics of two sisters, who are so similar to each other, although so different in character, refers to the idea of a bridge. These two poles, these two human beings, come together and diverge in mutual acceptance, in euphoric moments of harmony, as well as in destructive interdependencies, jealousy and competition for the strength of their talents and passions.","popularity":0.0306,"poster_path":"/sUqoKqAI5xlu0Z9dRk9S4uPghCd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44464,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stern Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Absolute Similarities","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1416410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandra Korzeniak","original_name":"Sandra Korzeniak","popularity":0.0847,"profile_path":"/ahWonv1FEhmJTDBbxcar0zf2J8W.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66ec4fcc065b70b5423257ce","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2640962,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Izabella Gustowska","original_name":"Izabella Gustowska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ec4fe4065b70b5423257ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2640962,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Izabella Gustowska","original_name":"Izabella Gustowska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ec4ff1dd8b3a03f9325845","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4951582,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Centrum Kultury Zamek","original_name":"Centrum Kultury Zamek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ec500c19e6f27f0546c07b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4951584,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Patryk Lichota","original_name":"Patryk Lichota","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ec501efee2d55381fa8021","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4951586,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mateusz Rogala","original_name":"Mateusz Rogala","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ec50304a2cd3dc8d46c13f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2835,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sUqoKqAI5xlu0Z9dRk9S4uPghCd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1984}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Camerimage International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
