Sugar cane and pineapple are the two main crops. Sugar cane, first cultivated in Hawaii over a century ago, is harvested after 1.5 to 2 years of growth, with fires used to clear leaves before gathering. Pineapples are planted using a paper mulch technique, and the ripe fruit is quickly processed for canning. Shipping plays a crucial role in transporting these products to the mainland U.S. and bringing necessary goods to Hawaii, making it vital for the islands' prosperity.","popularity":0.1101,"poster_path":"/1o8S74WLgRSSrHhQLhIiK72TA3y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":199881,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pat Dowling Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1951-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hawaiian Islands: The Chief Industries","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aOQkT6iiTC2iJjKv9K1uo9At6LI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1o8S74WLgRSSrHhQLhIiK72TA3y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1668,"name":"hawaii"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1951-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
