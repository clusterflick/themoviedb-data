Confined by a fence, bordering a picnic table that surrounds a tree encased in concrete crosshatches, the dancer explores how this architecture impacts her movement. Like Robert Irwin's Nine Spaces Nine Trees, the public sculpture where it was filmed, External Links invites meditation on confinement and freedom. How can movement of our own bodies become a link to experiences external to ourself? An other-worldly soundtrack by composer Paul Mathew Moore raises the possibility that these links might be portals to other dimensions.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"External Links","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4966044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Kwak","original_name":"Lisa Kwak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66f677d76cedbed01570b52d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4360711,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juliet McMains","original_name":"Juliet McMains","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66eaa42d1beca8ce07d35d7f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4908302,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Matthew Moore","original_name":"Paul Matthew Moore","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f678316c9a68155070be21","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Local Sightings","release_date":"2024-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
