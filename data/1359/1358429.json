The film uses these gates which symbolically mark the transition from the mundane to the sacred as representatives of a personal synaesthetic and spiritual journey through five levels of consciousness, traveling from existentialism to metaphysics, abstraction, and the Shinto deities called Kami, culminating in a final transition that weaves together these diverse philosophical threads. - New Jersey Film Festival","popularity":0.2003,"poster_path":"/cxlRFWtQXy76tASWF40LuWi6Lxf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Torii 鳥居","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1848345,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Martin Gerigk","original_name":"Martin Gerigk","popularity":0.0517,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66eb20ba1beca8ce07d3a938","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15208168","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cxlRFWtQXy76tASWF40LuWi6Lxf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":233,"name":"japan"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"New Jersey Film Festival","release_date":"2024-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Torii | 鳥居 - Trailer","key":"893707354","site":"Vimeo","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-12-12T13:06:55.000Z","id":"66eb219b5168a896e11f98e5"}]}}}
