A squad of fighters is defending their position in the small but strategically significant village of Sunja, where  the invaders have surrounded them on three sides. Ivan Salaj, a young and gifted director who was still enrolled in film  school at the time, chooses to use their story as the subject of his student film. Considered one of the most important films  from a period when Croatian independence was still at stake, it provides an accurate portrayal of life on the front lines.  What makes Hotel Sunja even more special is that it was made by a group of students who risked their lives to make the  movie.","popularity":0.3506,"poster_path":"/t9umIN8e9TbsW4Xb17F201Rx4g8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":64994,"logo_path":"/dLQeFa492g18EnsF0QN2LuToeYY.png","name":"Akademija dramske umjetnosti (ADU)","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"War isn't what TV news show","title":"Hotel Sunja","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1714799,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Salaj","original_name":"Ivan Salaj","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/zpvJQu5I2TJqPxlnik1u8uBZf5D.jpg","credit_id":"66eb5115b2917eb1800c09f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2589787,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Silvio Jesenković","original_name":"Silvio Jesenković","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66eb5198b66746dd790b4ceb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1714799,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Salaj","original_name":"Ivan Salaj","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/zpvJQu5I2TJqPxlnik1u8uBZf5D.jpg","credit_id":"66efe13f7ff2bf57cd2642e8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0104446","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vwefY1afUXlJ9qh2t2kj04tQB2m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t9umIN8e9TbsW4Xb17F201Rx4g8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":449,"name":"yugoslavia"},{"id":1248,"name":"croatia"},{"id":273967,"name":"war"},{"id":294205,"name":"war documentary"},{"id":298580,"name":"croatian history"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hr","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
