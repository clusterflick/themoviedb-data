The film invites you to dive into the creative world of these two experienced musicians who come from very distant countries: Uruguay and Japan. Twined by their passion and their charisma, they have been sharing routes and scores around the world since 1997 until today. Dos Orientales is a journey to the heart of cultural and musical differences that, rather than separating, unite and build bridges.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/oANFmb86JfrcrUWXgy60litpKud.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dos Orientales","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11985060","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.659,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oANFmb86JfrcrUWXgy60litpKud.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2017-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
