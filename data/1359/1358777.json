In the solitude of this place, his temple, he feels happy, full, fertile. Johanna, his sister-in-law, widow of his brother Caspar, approaches him by surprise and chases him through the trees, trying to reach an agreement with him about the guardianship of his son Karl. In his will, Caspar left his brother Ludwig as the sole guardian of his son Karl. But Ludwig was away for a few hours on Caspar's last night and when he returned in the morning the will had changed...  Between them there is more than a hard fight for the child. They are two untamed, wild, asocial beings, fighting for their freedom.","popularity":0.2971,"poster_path":"/73YEDu2mpKwbau8C4wySNlOkkn4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2021-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"He, hypersensitive and volcanic, she, a woman too free for her time, both unable to understand each other and reach an agreement, will fight fiercely until the end.","title":"Ludwig & Johanna","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Felipe García Vélez","original_name":"Felipe García Vélez","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":"/2mijkVpmg9mvZEJnw6iNI230O5J.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ludwig van Beethoven","credit_id":"66ed9d5b772d0fa573bdc34e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1139519,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"María Morales","original_name":"María Morales","popularity":0.1627,"profile_path":"/5GrA2RftV05xVp73lO2xvO7PoWw.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Johanna van Beethoven","credit_id":"66ed9db31923fe0327ade27d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Felipe García Vélez","original_name":"Felipe García Vélez","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":"/2mijkVpmg9mvZEJnw6iNI230O5J.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ludwig","credit_id":"66ed9df61923fe0327ade2ad","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1139519,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"María Morales","original_name":"María Morales","popularity":0.1627,"profile_path":"/5GrA2RftV05xVp73lO2xvO7PoWw.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Johanna","credit_id":"66ed9e084b672d7709bdebda","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3556356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raúl Gómez-Zurdo","original_name":"Raúl Gómez-Zurdo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/okY5ahiiBqcEaV9ATOhyuCCUfyP.jpg","credit_id":"66eda244b236c70006bde4c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3556356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raúl Gómez-Zurdo","original_name":"Raúl Gómez-Zurdo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/okY5ahiiBqcEaV9ATOhyuCCUfyP.jpg","credit_id":"66eda250c6a669d62abdf212","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/nf9swszkL6uLjXVKSK0pGbvs73G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/2dyIPvvsF1MD7VplsDho9D94isH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/9l0he5pykxyEoEqpoANEKCKcn3c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/xkDkUQEiH6GUSUsG93WflVQGdlW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/saKqs900umxaNLzkUYhSJLhXhui.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/kSEKLy640UIOpGpmKjg4PPUDZ9d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/9wTo88f1VPLXP9vmmceVaZiM3oE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":842,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/73YEDu2mpKwbau8C4wySNlOkkn4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":561},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/jeka8CL2xMUR5Zzgru5B3FYMsWh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18035,"name":"family"},{"id":162710,"name":"culture"},{"id":282633,"name":"history"},{"id":283297,"name":"music"},{"id":316421,"name":"drama"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"7","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"LUDWING Y JOHANNA | TEASER TRAILER | YAQ DISTRIBUCIÓN | CORTOMETRAJE | SHORTFILM","key":"6wRkgtktMO0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2021-02-28T20:49:43.000Z","id":"66ed98491923fe0327ade041"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"Ludwig and Johanna\" Trailer (English version)","key":"62acuHkM6Uc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-10-17T16:17:18.000Z","id":"66ed97d71923fe0327addfe6"}]}}}
