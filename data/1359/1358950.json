In a world where it was as if he had never existed: his children had managed to grow up, his wife had managed to alter their father's clothes for them, and the once familiar corners of his home hut seemed too sharp.

The film was based on the story of the same name by Andrei Platonov.","popularity":0.0742,"poster_path":"/eyQdzXW9CgwN5JXeeo2QlyiW0zR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109197,"logo_path":null,"name":"HSE Art and Design School","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2024-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Возвращение","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Vozvraschenie","type":"transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Vozvrashchenie","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3777501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergey Savluk","original_name":"Sergey Savluk","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66ec9ce1373c0ccc9cfa9695","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2388392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irina Semenova","original_name":"Irina Semenova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66ec9d11e08b18d3aafa95fc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4952219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ekaterina Ushakova","original_name":"Екатерина Ушакова","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66ec9d42373c0ccc9cfa96cb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2179359,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Svetoslav Vladimirov","original_name":"Svetoslav Vladimirov","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66ec9d6495ef84e3ec3265d3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4952221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Lomonosova","original_name":"Maria Lomonosova","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66ec9d893562807300fa91b0","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4952224,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sveta Vladimirova","original_name":"Света Владимирова","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ec9da9373c0ccc9cfa9705","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4952224,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sveta Vladimirova","original_name":"Света Владимирова","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ec9dcd3562807300fa91cf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4952224,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sveta Vladimirova","original_name":"Света Владимирова","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ec9de0fee2d55381fa958a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4952226,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Stanislav Bulanov","original_name":"Stanislav Bulanov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ec9df56868c7449546d7f8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4952224,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sveta Vladimirova","original_name":"Света Владимирова","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ec9e066868c7449546d808","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4952229,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Rachel Vasilchenko","original_name":"Rachel Vasilchenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ec9e196868c7449546d81c","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4952230,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Maxim Spitsyn","original_name":"Maxim Spitsyn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ec9e34065b70b54232776a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/eyQdzXW9CgwN5JXeeo2QlyiW0zR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Mayak Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
