Only this institution is in turmoil. As the fiftieth anniversary of the Mustang approaches and the car industry struggles through the deepest trough of the financial crisis, Ford launches a redesign. Now the jobs of workers at Ford’s Flat Rock Assembly Plant, the expectations of the thousands of Mustang devotees, and the livelihood of the city of Detroit are all placed squarely on the shoulders of Dave Pericak. As chief program engineer, he will guide the 2015 Mustang from assembly floor to showroom—if only he can get that vibration out of the steering wheel.","popularity":0.4755,"poster_path":"/h0wqRE85J7N1UDfNr1LEQVKv5jN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53972,"logo_path":"/bEnOf6B2GsW15f1NRg3Ao5Xw2Av.png","name":"White Horse Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Faster Horse","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":30,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2213135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Pericak","original_name":"Dave Pericak","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/MyJW7r2d2HPJPqd4fcxcdlZxzc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5c3791049251415312258fc3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1266474,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Iacocca","original_name":"Lee Iacocca","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/wNVBLB37ri7Qq8cPgESDPhok6KE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5c3791170e0a2631ad552cdd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2213137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rich Hansen","original_name":"Rich Hansen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5c379136925141531c25a081","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2213138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amy Hansen","original_name":"Amy Hansen","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/wK8nfTHc9dblzMBTvwO2fvIgGFK.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5c3791420e0a2631bc551e05","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Gelb","original_name":"David Gelb","popularity":0.1595,"profile_path":"/dHsVDBUQJPtUcsolCc1fD5zqoAJ.jpg","credit_id":"551865759251412b6d002e55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3762974","wikidata_id":"Q21070643","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":763,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r4gtwe9LsseNmJI0aiobCIG9Lpf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1357}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/h0wqRE85J7N1UDfNr1LEQVKv5jN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lahwpHoyw3lIlnHNVlIRVA1uMQb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":8241,"name":"mustang"},{"id":188950,"name":"corporation"},{"id":211277,"name":"car factory"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
