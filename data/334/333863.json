First broadcast in 1971.  The ballet was first performed by the Danish Royal Ballet, first as a TV show on the Danish public service channel called DR in 1971, then as a performance at the Danish Royal Theatre in 1972. The main part was danced by Vivi Flindt, and Flemming Flindt also starred. The ballet caused quite a stir, partly because of its spectacular nude dancing, but also the catchy music, published both complete on vinyl (which double-lp) and in abbreviated form on vinyl and CD.","popularity":0.4441,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1973-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ballet","title":"Dødens Triumf","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1448533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivi Flindt","original_name":"Vivi Flindt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"551c944dc3a3684a28001170","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1448534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flemming Flindt","original_name":"Flemming Flindt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"551c948f9251416a33001077","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10551,"name":"ballet"},{"id":183570,"name":"danish"},{"id":196683,"name":"operetta"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"da","note":"Transmission fra Det kongelige Teater af Flemmings Flindts dansedrama efter Eugéne Ionesco.
