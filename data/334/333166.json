From Nijeveen to Bergen op Zoom, from Weert to Broek op Langedijk. In almost unchanged composition, this band has been able to bind an ever-wider audience. They grew up together and made each other better by working together in a unique way. While for the outside world Huub van der Lubbe is the face of the band, the band is mainly a collective inside: everything is jointly decided. The documentary shows the year in which they release their first international album Hold on Tight and which would be crowned with a performance with Solomon Burke in Paradiso. It is different - the morning of his arrival in Amsterdam, Solomon Burke dies at Schiphol. De Dijk is devastated: they lose a friend, but also a possible international dream is shattered.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/4XhTBPsoZzDax0T7yXi0bgIMqIC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2013-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hou me vast - De Dijk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1245239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Huub van der Lubbe","original_name":"Huub van der Lubbe","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":"/2GdrowrpE2dsot1UmzEZAJ1zNdS.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"himself","credit_id":"598e100dc3a3687524017f5a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Solomon Burke","original_name":"Solomon Burke","popularity":0.1047,"profile_path":"/z8eMAL5bd77FKGsnw8OoMXAHH4R.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"himself","credit_id":"598e1029c3a36875c0017d01","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1176310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nico Arzbach","original_name":"Nico Arzbach","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"himself","credit_id":"598e103b92514178a401a860","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1176313,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonie Broek","original_name":"Antonie Broek","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"himself","credit_id":"598e1057c3a36875b10182fc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1176311,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pim Kops","original_name":"Pim Kops","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"himself","credit_id":"598e1068c3a368755901aa81","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1299703,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suzanne Raes","original_name":"Suzanne Raes","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":"/c3qQSSHGY84p3YrKi0MDGGJdjgN.jpg","credit_id":"598e0ff4c3a368755901a9da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2099635","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4XhTBPsoZzDax0T7yXi0bgIMqIC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2013-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
