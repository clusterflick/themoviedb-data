Such is the path for Kelly, who after growing up happily in a secular family is prompted to alter the course of her own life after her parents’ divorce. Enter Ron and Dawn Wright, a Christian couple who offer to serve as Kelly’s adopted spiritual-family through the courtship process. Now in her 30s, Kelly lives with the Wrights, relying on them to scout and vet all of her prospective partners, as she vows to save her next kiss for the altar.","popularity":0.0731,"poster_path":"/iEQicJDE0IJX7HJ6qdQDvw7kXk0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Courtship","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2882808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amy Kohn","original_name":"Amy Kohn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fcbc8808261ee004140b29d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2721875,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Evan Eames","original_name":"Evan Eames","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fcbc8c595c0af0046a4dbf6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":995367,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Valery Lyman","original_name":"Valery Lyman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fcbca2b11386c003ccfb8f5","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1718794,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jordan Montminy","original_name":"Jordan Montminy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fcbc91741aac4004074dcd7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2882808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amy Kohn","original_name":"Amy Kohn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fcbc86941aac40042753fc0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2882821,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jon Foy","original_name":"Jon Foy","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fcbc9cb41aac4004275426e","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2882827,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Joseph Van Harken","original_name":"Joseph Van Harken","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fcbca71383df2003e5ad185","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Camera"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4191350","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iEQicJDE0IJX7HJ6qdQDvw7kXk0.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9eICxuWtTXjR7LrXeNSV0SlHW6y.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1215}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
