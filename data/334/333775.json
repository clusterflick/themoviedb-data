If it sounds too good to be true, that’s because it was. Finch was an elaborate hoax constructed by the late George Plimpton for SI’s April 1 issue. Unhittable brings back all of the people who made this hoax possible, including Joe Berton, the bespectacled middle school teacher who truly brought Sidd to life.","popularity":0.2721,"poster_path":"/khlqiNB2SozLtesvmxbFA76Ks5J.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unhittable: Sidd Finch and the Tibetan Fastball","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1111756,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Sillen","original_name":"Peter Sillen","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":"/nJe1m4rrp6RFeUJ4WIV7e9Als4e.jpg","credit_id":"551c1042c3a3681f2b000068","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1081,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/khlqiNB2SozLtesvmxbFA76Ks5J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
