Hans Frank and Otto von W채chter were indicted as war criminals for their roles in WWII. Nazi Governors and consultants to Hitler himself, the two are collectively responsible for thousands of deaths. But what stood out to Philippe Sands were the impressions they left on their sons. While researching the Nuremberg trials, the human rights lawyer came across two men who re-focused his studies: Niklas Frank and Horst von W채chter. The men hold polar opposite views on the men who raised them.","popularity":0.7038,"poster_path":"/n7i41SR4QDKJnpGoClt6rrvOqiw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1508,"logo_path":"/zh2EDFdxqFmt695ZzHFuamAbeUo.png","name":"Wildgaze
