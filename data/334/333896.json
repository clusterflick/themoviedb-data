The camera travels freely, through the port, market, streets and cafés, capturing everyday people, some of whom recur frequently enough to seem like protagonists. The nominal plotline follows a French tourist couple’s leisurely visit to the city, the man having previously served in the army during the Algerian war. As they walk around, his comments betray his mindset’s racist colonial prejudices, while his wife reiterates asinine clichés. Their unhurried wandering is interrupted when he comes across a blind man and realises that he tortured him during his army service. The film is punctuated with punchy sequences that show a poet named Momo delivering verse as an elegy for Algiers.","popularity":0.5441,"poster_path":"/rQVrpzU6rndLqBtiEHkZBDiypYa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97160,"logo_path":null,"name":"APC d'Alger","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"}],"release_date":"1971-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tahia Ya Didou !","video":false,"vote_average":8.333,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Alger insolite !","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"AE","title":"تحية يا ديدو!","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SA","title":"تحية يا ديدو!","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"TN","title":"تحية يا ديدو!","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"EG","title":"تحية يا ديدو!","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"MA","title":"تحية يا ديدو!","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"QA","title":"تحية يا ديدو!","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","title":"تحية يا ديدو!","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":929339,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohamed Zinet","original_name":"Mohamed Zinet","popularity":0.1767,"profile_path":"/1zbSOuOYT9lBPlN2ZNihEtgU9wV.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Hassan","credit_id":"5a05d95fc3a36872db000979","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1819807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Himoud Brahimi","original_name":"Himoud Brahimi","popularity":0.1071,"profile_path":"/lBLZnSn8jTcjkFKh67uwTriwQak.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Momo, the poet","credit_id":"62207aab001bbd001bcd82c2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1448606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suzie Nacer","original_name":"Suzie Nacer","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The French Woman","credit_id":"551d0917c3a3684a2000223f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3593927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georges Arnaud","original_name":"Georges Arnaud","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"","credit_id":"62af03df62e86f0050200f8f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1819807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Himoud Brahimi","original_name":"Himoud Brahimi","popularity":0.1071,"profile_path":"/lBLZnSn8jTcjkFKh67uwTriwQak.jpg","credit_id":"62207bb29f1be7001b1a4494","department":"Crew","job":"Poem"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1819807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Himoud Brahimi","original_name":"Himoud Brahimi","popularity":0.1071,"profile_path":"/lBLZnSn8jTcjkFKh67uwTriwQak.jpg","credit_id":"62207ba9eea34d0043012bd6","department":"Writing","job":"Dialogue"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":929339,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohamed Zinet","original_name":"Mohamed Zinet","popularity":0.1767,"profile_path":"/1zbSOuOYT9lBPlN2ZNihEtgU9wV.jpg","credit_id":"551d08fb9251416a33002262","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3320867,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"El Hadj M'hamed El Anka","original_name":"El Hadj M'hamed El Anka","popularity":0.0847,"profile_path":"/truOH4RZnkt4cSZKLEWx9gqkz6G.jpg","credit_id":"61ba3ee5223e200042ae2c0f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":929339,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohamed Zinet","original_name":"Mohamed Zinet","popularity":0.1767,"profile_path":"/1zbSOuOYT9lBPlN2ZNihEtgU9wV.jpg","credit_id":"5a05d99dc3a368721a000a1f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1921186,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antonio Catalano","original_name":"Antonio Catalano","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a05d9cf92514126ba000ad1","department":"Sound","job":"Other"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1921187,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"A.
