An end-of-the-West Western, it shows its grizzled hero revisiting the town of his youthful exploits. But now, in an anticipation of Ride the High Country (1962), civilization has taken over. Cars chase Bud off the streets and the theatre features movies (Universal Bluebirds at that, a bit of product placement). Ford heightens the contrast by letting us into the hero’s memory, introduced by the title: “Memories of the past flashing back to him”—the earliest reference to the term “flashback” I recall seeing in the movies.","popularity":0.1646,"poster_path":"/nqITHLeRC4wZBt0VrtKxYmYGtkM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1919-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Outlaw","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8500,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Ford","original_name":"John Ford","popularity":0.8044,"profile_path":"/ffgVJWV8pDomSdTkjOqdrwMX9G6.jpg","credit_id":"551b2c4c9251414aed000c89","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0208256","wikidata_id":"Q3521529","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nqITHLeRC4wZBt0VrtKxYmYGtkM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cy2Wzu7UdF5wDNsxrevkVrASjg0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1919-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
