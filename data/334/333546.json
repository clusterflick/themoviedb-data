He imagines what might occur if Shih-T’ao’s six poetic procedures for attaining the primal respiration or cosmic breath in painting were applied to one of the flagships of Western art, Velazquez’s Las Meninas.  Ruiz wants the three cultures to interact and test each other like the paper, stone and scissors of the children’s game. The result is an insoluble dispute, a différend. No reconciliation or compromise is possible between these cultural outlooks.","popularity":0.1845,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3541,"logo_path":null,"name":"Koninck Studios","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wind Water","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Feng Shui","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Badin","original_name":"Jean Badin","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/8RQFic73BKbYSWPMqtLrZce0iVM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (Voice)","credit_id":"5ef79d45be7f3500359e81d8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raúl Ruiz","original_name":"Raúl Ruiz","popularity":0.2407,"profile_path":"/gsJkcICbmk1GCi3EkDkxE6qZcpe.jpg","credit_id":"551a26cac3a36835bf000e9b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":134464,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Valeria Sarmiento","original_name":"Valeria Sarmiento","popularity":0.0896,"profile_path":"/heyXSDnTvdX3wVLbfwE2Qtclf2S.jpg","credit_id":"5ef79dadfa4046003406b6d6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134463,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jorge Arriagada","original_name":"Jorge Arriagada","popularity":0.0524,"profile_path":"/zf99gSiTF63GgOhRNYsEp4j8czk.jpg","credit_id":"5ef79dbca284eb00398cb35a","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raúl Ruiz","original_name":"Raúl Ruiz","popularity":0.2407,"profile_path":"/gsJkcICbmk1GCi3EkDkxE6qZcpe.jpg","credit_id":"5ef79d9f27d9cc0038adf94c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1159388,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"François Ede","original_name":"François Ede","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef79d9113af5f00345677c2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1371590","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/28JcKpD5xI1lQUi7wHhZMVJdPTq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
