While Roseanne may have revolutionized the way Americans talked about family, class, race, gender, and gay rights, this campaign trail adventure is a personal account of Roseanne’s thoughts on these subjects—and others, as we have never heard them before. What seems at first like a political profile quickly becomes a humorous and sentimental picture of an icon. This surprising journey uncovers raw and revealing moments from Roseanne’s private world, while juxtaposing her current influence as a politician with her role as a comedy leader in the '90s.","popularity":0.409,"poster_path":"/4ZtL74q8JACfRb5U2yBDzGko5Qj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roseanne for President!","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":46393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roseanne Barr","original_name":"Roseanne Barr","popularity":0.5177,"profile_path":"/oyY5lWTFzhymLB4sJ1OODseI3jR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"576455eb92514142f500010b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rocky Anderson","original_name":"Rocky Anderson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/uVbJ17ZyrsyBQKXCE1CNoIhEfIE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"673ccabe06fd885ab9dd9fd8","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1447266,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Weinrib","original_name":"Eric Weinrib","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55187c209251412cb90030e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3791268","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":3.442,"height":172,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lmYkDct2oYHNVW7CQnZ1cmm63Fm.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":592}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":814,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4ZtL74q8JACfRb5U2yBDzGko5Qj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":547}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Roseanne for President!
