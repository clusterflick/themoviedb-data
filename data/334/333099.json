The film is chock-full of incredible characters. From the questionable District Attorney Kevin Crane, and the highly-confused witness Chuck Erickson, to the high-powered Chicago attorney Kathleen Zellner, the doc depicts both a highly flawed justice system, as well as one that can work brilliantly.","popularity":0.177,"poster_path":"/fOWN2sbHbZ2oWcnTUe5XM8HcAA1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
