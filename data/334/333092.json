Feeling abandoned by her husband and unable to connect with her infant son, she takes up an invitation from her old high school group of guy friends to go on a weekend trip to the mountains. Without the pressure of daily responsibilities and with the help of psychoactive mushrooms, Molly comes out of her shell and is ready to accept the beauty and love that can be found in nature. When Molly's “trip” turns into a dark out-of-body experience she is forced to choose between the person she was and the person she's become.","popularity":0.2565,"poster_path":"/o4bnmys2LUC9bNVJOX634IKzQA3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
