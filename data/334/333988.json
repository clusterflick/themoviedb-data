Forrester recounts previously unknown aspects of the life of Thelonious Monk and the Jazz Baroness, Pannonica Rothschild. The film also explores bebop's origins in the Harlem jazz club Minton's, Forrester's work as a composer of African American church music, as an improv accompanist for silent movies, and as a teacher of jazz musical forms. Forrester's story plays out like a jazz tune: a strong theme runs through a series of improvisational changes, solo riffs, and ensemble resolutions to weave the fabric of a bebop life.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/yWs5oYtCCLKDq7Ss1cQjvzDVyGk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Embracing Dissonance: A Life in Bebop","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2245206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joel Forrester","original_name":"Joel Forrester","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c6b17520e0a261e069ba4de","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1052259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Daly","original_name":"Claire Daly","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5c6b175f0e0a260e9e973eef","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2245204,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Gottlieb","original_name":"David Gottlieb","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6b17380e0a262b349adcb1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2245204,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Gottlieb","original_name":"David Gottlieb","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c6b17410e0a262b349adcbb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yWs5oYtCCLKDq7Ss1cQjvzDVyGk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
