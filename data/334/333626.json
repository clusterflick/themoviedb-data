Taking advantage of an opportunity to study abroad, she was anxious to escape her mother’s authority and avoid a similar fate as an overweight, underappreciated housewife. Traumatized by her decision, the filmmaker began to develop symptoms of anorexia and proceeded to document her mental decline and eventual recovery. Combining video performance art with an intimate home-movie diary, this self-documented coming-of-age story demonstrates how video technologies can be used to capture the most intimate, confessional voice of a filmmaker.","popularity":0.1301,"poster_path":"/kzlgcym0HOQw9TgQsn8krPaDOLG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2002-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":154,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gina Kim’s Video Diary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":145359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gina Kim","original_name":"Gina Kim","popularity":0.1065,"profile_path":"/olpvD8B7H8afWYnXvgNWDoSe5Ef.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67e356d3d4052f4793dc9056","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":145359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gina Kim","original_name":"Gina Kim","popularity":0.1065,"profile_path":"/olpvD8B7H8afWYnXvgNWDoSe5Ef.jpg","credit_id":"551b09b59251414af3000895","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":145359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gina Kim","original_name":"Gina Kim","popularity":0.1065,"profile_path":"/olpvD8B7H8afWYnXvgNWDoSe5Ef.jpg","credit_id":"67e5941ae8a1910e6510c2b5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":145359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gina Kim","original_name":"Gina Kim","popularity":0.1065,"profile_path":"/olpvD8B7H8afWYnXvgNWDoSe5Ef.jpg","credit_id":"67e59445e8a1910e6510c2c6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0382780","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xP2xDgvjHNYhwelwymLFdK6BG6F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kzlgcym0HOQw9TgQsn8krPaDOLG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jeonju International Film Festival","release_date":"2002-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
