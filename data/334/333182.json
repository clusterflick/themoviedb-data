A film experiment that deals with the photoreality and the surrealism of life. A collage-animation that cuts up photos and newsreel film and reassembles them, producing an image that is a mixture of unexplainable fact (Why is Harpo Marx playing a harp in the middle of a battlefield?) with inexplicable act (Why is there a battlefield?). It is a black comedy, a fantasy that mocks death ... a parabolic parable.","popularity":0.5193,"poster_path":"/733b00qcMuHGVRXqLyg7yLxfNQv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1963-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Trageede In Masks","title":"Breathdeath","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Breath Death","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Breathdeath: A Trageede in Masks","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1126159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan VanDerBeek","original_name":"Stan VanDerBeek","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/2lQIoHSteolRdzxLINRCXzBX2yE.jpg","credit_id":"55176a6ac3a36862f6002234","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1126159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan VanDerBeek","original_name":"Stan VanDerBeek","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/2lQIoHSteolRdzxLINRCXzBX2yE.jpg","credit_id":"55176a7cc3a3686692000a73","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1446919,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jay Watt","original_name":"Jay Watt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55176a9b9251412c1e000b37","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1937108","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e8LuJQvQwKGmqJ1IfLzv7gdMJFD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/733b00qcMuHGVRXqLyg7yLxfNQv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":8201,"name":"satire"},{"id":9887,"name":"surrealism"},{"id":208226,"name":"video collage"},{"id":214793,"name":"cutout animation"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Knokke Experimental Film Festival","release_date":"1963-12-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
