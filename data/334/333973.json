Nevertheless, while its aim is clear, the message is vague and up to interpretation. Wherever it casts its eye, Faroughi’s camera tries to register this somehow cynical dichotomy. It begins in a theater house in the old city of Isfahan that has staged Shakespeare’s Othello. There is no attentive audience and the players are detached and exhausted. A young man from amongst the audience begins a long journey into the web of narrow alleys of Isfahan and ends up in the main mosque of the city where he meets a young girl. Despite the initial chaotic situations, from its halfway point, the film begins to render a silent observation of a night that will end at the break of dawn.","popularity":0.0689,"poster_path":"/zAvxt6kXJrIfs1Bn0HjxGEu1olZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"1964-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dawn of the Capricorn","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","title":"طلوع جدی","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IR","title":"Tolu-e Fajr","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1448776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ahmad Faruqi Qajar","original_name":"Ahmad Faruqi","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/j9vhvc6DwOYG58vPdxqusPvgNvW.jpg","credit_id":"551d4ae2c3a3683a18000132","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6949578","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sEosQrpZARhkBYtfPE1ei80kWHr.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/usVXTNR9jlqnjXy9SHWO3jYFuIy.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zAvxt6kXJrIfs1Bn0HjxGEu1olZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1964-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"طلوع جدی  ساخته احمد فاروقی قاجار","key":"jBGdLL5e18I","published_at":"2017-03-25T15:05:19.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"id":"5a062278c3a36879140018e3"}]}}}
