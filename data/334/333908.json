Within this we were trying to tackle two other concerns. One being the terms (and positions) inherent in the discourse surrounding the issues, i.e. terrorism, colonialism, occupation, resistance, collaboration, experts, spokespeople, leadership, the land, etc., and the other being the history and structure of the documentary genre specifically in regards to the representation of other cultures by the West in documentary, ethnography and anthropological practise and the problems/agenda involved from the perspective of the subjects viewed and the practitioners practising. Up to the South challenges traditional documentary formats by positing representation itself as a politicized practice.","popularity":0.0673,"poster_path":"/kfmn8JZfJgvbgO0Q5bYiGMHa28h.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Up to the South","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1267067,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jayce Salloum","original_name":"Jayce Salloum","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"551d13349251416a2300255f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1855277,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walid Raad","original_name":"Walid Raad","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f18dfa6c92c5d00363c3602","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Ku93VbWlu0JgzjNTFbzDOW8Wdi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kfmn8JZfJgvbgO0Q5bYiGMHa28h.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
