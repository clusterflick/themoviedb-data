After losing his own brother to the growing epidemic of prescription drug abuse, documentarian Chris Bell sets out to demystify this insidious addiction. Bell’s examination into the motives of big pharma and doctors in this ever-growing market leads him to meet with experts on the nature of addiction, survivors with first-hand accounts of their struggle, and whistleblowers who testify to the dollar-driven aims of pharmaceutical corporations. Ultimately his investigation will point back to where it all began: his own front door.","popularity":0.7722,"poster_path":"/7V6sDOLCNXcqHsqToGDACbK3HGE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9118,"logo_path":"/9o6KLcDBRw3fNItUflJVwj8dZpC.png","name":"Samuel Goldwyn Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":13150,"logo_path":"/v9s0IXHruAX6APhu08b8FItrIf1.png","name":"Naked Edge Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Is there really a war on drugs?","title":"Prescription Thugs","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":43,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"Op recept van de dokter","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"I bulli delle ricette","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78720,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Bell","original_name":"Chris Bell","popularity":0.0784,"profile_path":"/bCirEu4GYzWXXOQxK98sC2M2qgt.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Host","credit_id":"5e8d2bab87e63e00172ae1a5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1863739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Lieu","original_name":"Ted Lieu","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":"/nyoAh5QZzE5flXfAKuK35bwF7bX.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"650a5ddd81c7be00adfec360","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1222660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Sakoda","original_name":"Ryan Sakoda","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":"/n26P6VWGZkjGnIXpqAm0lMOOf5j.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66953761f6220421c36606c8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":983700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Wiese","original_name":"Matthew Wiese","popularity":0.1497,"profile_path":"/j2i0xY4reL7WuMsyZSGll34BHtF.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6695376d93dde326935349fd","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":208343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Alexander","original_name":"Josh Alexander","popularity":0.181,"profile_path":"/yTzk3rur6gZ8eD2s4fZFGYaCS7c.jpg","credit_id":"6260194ad4cc8e0051a53e40","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78720,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Bell","original_name":"Chris Bell","popularity":0.0784,"profile_path":"/bCirEu4GYzWXXOQxK98sC2M2qgt.jpg","credit_id":"55187866c3a36862ef004a17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":208343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Alexander","original_name":"Josh Alexander","popularity":0.181,"profile_path":"/yTzk3rur6gZ8eD2s4fZFGYaCS7c.jpg","credit_id":"6695371885361c73edcb46fe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4505666","wikidata_id":"Q50413564","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zVxpQ2S1nkDDElRIwjFEwWRXjDa.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eUwdKDd72NzVlhXIlJwgUBNnfSp.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4f211APwQdaCO1ovOLCyWOgwNbq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7V6sDOLCNXcqHsqToGDACbK3HGE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":726,"name":"drug abuse"},{"id":3524,"name":"doping"},{"id":6135,"name":"pharmaceutical industry"},{"id":165423,"name":"prescription drug abuse"},{"id":286307,"name":"opioids"},{"id":293740,"name":"opioid epidemic"},{"id":302150,"name":"opioid crisis"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Tribeca Film Festival","release_date":"2015-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"PRESCRIPTION THUGS - Official Trailer","key":"anDTez2fVVA","published_at":"2015-11-04T16:59:28.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"5bb196d9925141167b00b10c"}]}}}
