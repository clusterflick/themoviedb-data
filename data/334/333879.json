Salah left his three sisters and his mother to become an ambassador, going to work on a Defense site, wading in the mud, he works with a jackhammer. Salah wanders in search of work and housing. Coming up against racism from the owners claiming the respectability of the building and the good neighborhood, he finds himself in a hotel in the Goutte d'Or district. The body of Mehdi, friend of Salah, was found in the Canal Saint-Martin, murdered by a fascist commando, and Ali died of a bullet, killed by a racist janitor. Faced with crimes that remain unpunished, Salah and his friends organize, unite with the French working class to defend their lives and their right to work.","popularity":0.7547,"poster_path":"/yvITyvUT1gQsrVsraMckpq419zb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10647,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unité Trois","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":49800,"logo_path":null,"name":"SATPEC","origin_country":"TN"},{"id":195521,"logo_path":null,"name":"OGEK","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"LY","name":"Libyan Arab Jamahiriya"},{"iso_3166_1":"TN","name":"Tunisia"}],"release_date":"1975-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ambassadors","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"TN","title":"السفراء","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"LY","title":"السفراء","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","title":"السفراء","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SA","title":"السفراء","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"AE","title":"السفراء","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"QA","title":"السفراء","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IQ","title":"السفراء","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"MR","title":"السفراء","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IR","title":"السفراء","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"MA","title":"السفراء","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":543092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sid Ali Kouiret","original_name":"Sid Ali Kouiret","popularity":0.1944,"profile_path":"/rMF8O8YxViMjAdOsBfrkEAKgUd6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Salah","credit_id":"551cfb669251416a230020b0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1448585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tahar Kebaili","original_name":"Tahar Kebaili","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/urjM9LaAE2t0YvLrhuDhKVB47Py.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mehdi","credit_id":"551cfb769251416a33001fe7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1866966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohamed Hamam","original_name":"Mohamed Hamam","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wKvlyScWxD1PFqVT4EWC1Bq8MzF.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ahmed","credit_id":"598b966dc3a36863cb0007af","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1866968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Faouzi Kasri","original_name":"Faouzi Kasri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Ali","credit_id":"598b9694c3a36863aa0006b2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":586258,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Med Hondo","original_name":"Med Hondo","popularity":0.0586,"profile_path":"/oTanMS7MnWhedjQF7wONNyEXXv4.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Med","credit_id":"598b96f192514107bc000015","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Rispal","original_name":"Jacques Rispal","popularity":0.1783,"profile_path":"/r6JQYuwOQRKssHrEudHl4FxJrIa.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"M.
