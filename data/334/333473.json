It's a cautionary tale of what happens when punctuality, protocol and efficiency are taken to the extreme. On Monday April 25th 2005, a West Japan Railway commuter train crashed into an apartment building and killed 107 people. Just what pressures made the driver risk so much for such a minimal delay?  Piecing together personal accounts of those affected by the train crash, with insights from experts and former train drivers, the film poses a question for a society that equates speed with progress. It offers a fascinating insight into the railway's role in Japan's post-war economic boom and the dangers of corner-cutting in the prolonged economic stagnation that followed. Through the lens of this catastrophic train crash, Brakeless considers the ultimate cost efficiency.","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2014-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Why Trains Crash","title":"Brakeless","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"ブレーキなき社会～JR福知山線脱線事故9年","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","title":"80秒殺人事件","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","title":"死亡列車終點站","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1447753,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kyoko Miyake","original_name":"Kyoko Miyake","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/yZ1hfWE3lPpUDD0msN0zRQqpukF.jpg","credit_id":"551982f79251412c1e006c15","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3695226","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-03-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
