He played a major role in the Polynesian cultural revival, particularly in the revival of Polynesian tattoos. We accompany Chef Miko to choose good wood. This is an opportunity to hear the testimony of his Dusseldorf counterpart, Andreas Dettloff. Dettloff is a German visual artist living in Tahiti for around twenty years, who works on popular culture. The meeting with Chief Miko goes so well that a few days later we go to visit Dettloff at his home.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/yn2X2cY099ccXEE7fHhrO2i91F5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":173937,"logo_path":null,"name":"Emotion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PF","name":"French Polynesia"}],"release_date":"2016-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Michel Toofa Pouira Krainer, known as Chief Miko is a French Polynesian speaker, sculptor, traditional navigator, musician, singer, customary chief and activist.","title":"Miko the clairvoyant chef","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4500079,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chief Miko","original_name":"Chief Miko","popularity":0.0716,"profile_path":"/lEfdJeL24A3KKUfm72gbZVlbhbo.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"65b2bc44dbcade016292a447","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4500083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andreas Dettloff","original_name":"Andreas Dettloff","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/bGrMjHzspIsqleF2nJAfjJHCGTT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"65b2bc5da199a6017c9d8154","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4500084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Mara","original_name":"Michel Mara","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"65b2bc734a0b190184caa8b4","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4444561,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Bougard","original_name":"Jonathan Bougard","popularity":0.0816,"profile_path":"/ddpd85hcBmbCbXIsyRvBpZTgJ7e.jpg","credit_id":"65b2bc8fd7cd0601847d50b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2626520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Philippe Joaquim","original_name":"Jean-Philippe Joaquim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b2bca3ad59b50186f66f31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4444561,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Bougard","original_name":"Jonathan Bougard","popularity":0.0816,"profile_path":"/ddpd85hcBmbCbXIsyRvBpZTgJ7e.jpg","credit_id":"65b35299002134014b7bae5b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30985739","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":2340,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yn2X2cY099ccXEE7fHhrO2i91F5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1571}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PF","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
