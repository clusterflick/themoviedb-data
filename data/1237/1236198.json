Jørgen Roos has manipulated the whole thing. Joan is a professional go-go dancer. People like to look at her and she likes to be watched when she dances. For her, dance is an expression of a kind of joy in life, which is perhaps a postulate. So is the movie. Symbols are such a pretentious thing. Is she thinking all that? Do we put something into it ourselves, or is it manipulation with a hidden meaning - it really doesn't matter, because she is very sweet  - Joan.
