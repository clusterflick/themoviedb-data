Unlike Feher's, his name did not make it into the reference film encyclopedias; a modest rehabilitation of Hanus's half-remembered earliest work from the years of the First World War did not occur until the 1990s. The Czech National Film Archive has a copy of \"Mrs. Happiness\" 1922 film in its collections, but there are no records of its screening in other cinemas.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Mrs. Happiness","title":"Die Schuhe einer schönen Frau","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0217784","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
