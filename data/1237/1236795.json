He writes that her picture \"helps me remember what it was like to be me.\" He tells her about sorties into No Man's Land, and that they have orders tonight to charge. Then, his letter becomes a report of that charge: toward an armed German soldier who doesn't fire, even when John reaches him and jumps into the trench beside him. What happens next brings silence and an end to the letter.","popularity":0.676,"poster_path":"/pLsjm0eBCglEEy2ZxxweclIjpHM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":219355,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ex Mortis Films","origin_country":""},{"id":107971,"logo_path":"/41MbzYgni2yh7GTjzYfX7w2b8GH.png","name":"Imperial War Museums","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":219356,"logo_path":null,"name":"Marathon County Public Library","origin_country":""},{"id":219357,"logo_path":null,"name":"New York Public Library","origin_country":""},{"id":14872,"logo_path":"/udD9q0nbMXvneV4lpqYcOR7om74.png","name":"Tisch School of the Arts (NYU)","origin_country":"US"},{"id":219358,"logo_path":null,"name":"MovieScore Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Letter from the Western Front","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":209343,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brian K.
