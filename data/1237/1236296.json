In 2008, I started to capture June, my ultimately favorite month, in picture and sound. Diary film, Berlin portrait, life excerpt, colorful poem, something like that now every year.

And me.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ode to June 4","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1882382,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dagie Brundert","original_name":"Dagie Brundert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/OV1ehMr8YUWy1Rmkht64eXg9Jx.jpg","credit_id":"65b39ef85e14e501620c3f01","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26379509","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
