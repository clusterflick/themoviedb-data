The film paints a portrait of professor Ross Woodman (1922-2014), Jungian author Marion Woodman, and their extraordinary marriage. A champion of creative imagination, Ross was also an original interpreter of depth psychology in the context of his knowledge of world literature and religions. His generosity as a mentor, and his artistry as a lecturer on the poetry of Blake, Shelley and the Romantics made him unforgettable, life changing. He played a key role in the 'Regionalist' art scene in London, Ontario in the 1960s which gave us many of Canada's most significant artists. Ross accompanied Marion through her journey as a pioneering Jungian analyst who brought the Feminine into depth psychology. Through the prism of Woodman's troubled life, the film maker explores the dynamic among, love, creativity and madness in movies, poetry and art.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/4tfKC3uQPmAgZXe2mmbm4n8yN5e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":219325,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ecotone Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rebel Angel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4502227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ross Woodman","original_name":"Ross Woodman","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"subject of the documentary","credit_id":"65b44f3d12425c016247c923","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3418971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marion Woodman","original_name":"Marion Woodman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Subject of the documentary","credit_id":"65b44f56b1131f018d286df2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2331359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Lowry","original_name":"Chris Lowry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b44da5b1131f0172286894","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2331359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Lowry","original_name":"Chris Lowry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b44dc260c51d0184cffba4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2331359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Lowry","original_name":"Chris Lowry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b44dd81c635b0147124f9f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.748,"height":1799,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4tfKC3uQPmAgZXe2mmbm4n8yN5e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1346}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Rebel | Angel Trailer.m4v","key":"736656867","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-11-03T16:35:08.000Z","id":"65b44e7912425c018347ccf1"}]}}}
