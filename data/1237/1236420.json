During their travels, Grandfather tells the story of Minakata Kumagusu, a naturalist of early 20th century Japan.  “Whenever Kumagusu took walks in the forest, he would take a compact microscope along with him so he could observe the slime molds. They’re like tiny gods that can’t be seen with the naked eye, but these microorganisms work to connect the worlds of plants and animals. Kumagusu ventured deep into the sacred groves of Japan’s old shrines in search of these tiny gods – the slime molds which formed an important part of the ecosystem.”  Grandfather takes us on a journey deep into the sacred groves of Japan’s old shrines.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/8YNM5VLdKMBuAa7On6YTv8D2X1i.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Passing through the Shrine's Gate","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4268456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sho Ikeda","original_name":"Sho Ikeda","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b651076e0d720149479ded","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8YNM5VLdKMBuAa7On6YTv8D2X1i.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1802}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
