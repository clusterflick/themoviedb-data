In Vitaria we are Rurutu Protestants. This church draws on its autochthony to regain control over individuals and their native land. To stay in the symbolism, it should be noted that the geographical point furthest from Jerusalem is located in the Austral archipelago, south of the island of Rapa. The prism of local Christianity will be an opportunity to focus on the lives of the people of Vitaria, to get to know Patia Taputu, a charismatic character who is a farmer, breeder and fisherman. His wife Tiare is a recognized craftswoman. The couple raised their seven children on vanilla, coffee, egg production and making woven hats from white pandanus.","popularity":0.0766,"poster_path":"/rIZGe5tZ7Z0omekLo4f3mH6RNZE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":216648,"logo_path":null,"name":"In Vivo Prod","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PF","name":"French Polynesia"}],"release_date":"2018-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Discovery of the community of Vitaria, on the island of Rurutu in the Austral archipelago in Polynesia.","title":"Rurutu Vitaria","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4500390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patia Taputu","original_name":"Patia Taputu","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"65b2e07d96386401640ede06","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4500391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiare Taputu","original_name":"Tiare Taputu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"65b2e08fdbcade016292ac96","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4444561,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Bougard","original_name":"Jonathan Bougard","popularity":0.0816,"profile_path":"/ddpd85hcBmbCbXIsyRvBpZTgJ7e.jpg","credit_id":"65b2e0afce4ddc01848ac684","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4444561,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Bougard","original_name":"Jonathan Bougard","popularity":0.0816,"profile_path":"/ddpd85hcBmbCbXIsyRvBpZTgJ7e.jpg","credit_id":"65b353d0d236e60184bfef9a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30985851","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.678,"height":1988,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rIZGe5tZ7Z0omekLo4f3mH6RNZE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1348}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PF","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
