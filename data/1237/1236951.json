Yet even he could scarcely have imagined they would one day apply to the Southeastern United States, a region better known for plentiful rainfall and abundantly flowing rivers. But for almost twenty years three states – Georgia, Florida and Alabama – have been locked in a fierce struggle over water.  This longstanding conflict, recently ratcheted up to new level of intensity by a severe drought and a judge’s dramatic ruling, is the subject of a new documentary, Chattahoochee: From Water War to Water Vision. By interweaving individual stories, Chattahoochee: From Water War to Water Vision, will educate viewers on the complex issues and choices that increasingly face all of us when it comes to one of our most precious natural resources, water.","popularity":0.3366,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chattahoochee: From Water War to Water Vision","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Coyote","original_name":"Peter Coyote","popularity":1.5648,"profile_path":"/ld3xLYTcZWjAc0bE33DONT7n9o8.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"67396bb3443543191ccbdaf4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1295042,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jonathan Wickham","original_name":"Jonathan Wickham","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b560d658efd3017ccaa944","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4503479,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Katherine Crosby","original_name":"Katherine Crosby","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b561b4afe224016338dd95","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4503484,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sona Chambers","original_name":"Sona Chambers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b5620eb6cff10163f6737b","department":"Production","job":"Development Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4503476,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Chris Fogg","original_name":"Chris Fogg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b561852faf4d0163dc431d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4503473,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rhett Turner","original_name":"Rhett Turner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b560c54f33ad017a0be22a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4503478,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Greg Pope","original_name":"Greg Pope","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b561972faf4d017cdc8f30","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
