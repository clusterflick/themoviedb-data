Manny initially refuses, clinging to his rights as Sameer's husband, while knowing that with every passing hour, Sameer's family grows more infuriated. After an emotional climax, spurred on by the family’s homophobic claim that Manny and Sameer’s marriage was merely a green-card arrangement, Manny comes to realize that his objections won't change the fact that his husband died — try as he might, he cannot delay grief.","popularity":0.5715,"poster_path":"/ytIVUCc8Hgx2LYZhbnBGABy7yo0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":227429,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elessar
