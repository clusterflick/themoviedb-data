The film also broadens its scope to explore the overlooked, eclectic and often ultra-violent sub-genre THE FARMER belongs to - The Returning Veteran film. A film type that hit its stride in the 1970's with hard hitting character studies such as WELCOME HOME, SOLDIERS BOYS (1971), THE NO MERCY MAN (1973) and ROLLING THUNDER (1977).","popularity":0.4138,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How a Revenge Film was Buried for Decades","title":"Best Served Cold","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gary Conway","original_name":"Gary Conway","popularity":0.3752,"profile_path":"/9vg3jyFntkhwiQgiV4Q1UhFys24.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"65b4bc0eb6cff10163f60f0f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1190889,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stratton Leopold","original_name":"Stratton Leopold","popularity":0.0584,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"65b4bc2aafe224018438ac58","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1035,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Schrader","original_name":"Paul Schrader","popularity":0.7513,"profile_path":"/ctRxgCUSRFudwFaPG2AanL71Y3V.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"65b4bc43afe224018438ac7a","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":16545,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Morrell","original_name":"David Morrell","popularity":1.025,"profile_path":"/7qROomgiNAvmm0EWzb8y7fJ6fXy.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"65b4bc57b1131f014928c5ba","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Railsback","original_name":"Steve Railsback","popularity":0.5162,"profile_path":"/wztkAOAQZNGLlbrUrGIhV5cr1S0.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"65b4bc69f6596f0149fdd286","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elliott Street","original_name":"Elliott Street","popularity":0.111,"profile_path":"/ozyQt3dMFgKlUG1moSGe7txrWZA.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"65b4bc7c12425c01834875ce","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086894,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eric Zaldivar","original_name":"Eric Zaldivar","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/yQtsimXwmFryyGKMD0yqKovINdF.jpg","credit_id":"65b4bb681c635b0147129ccd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086894,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eric Zaldivar","original_name":"Eric Zaldivar","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/yQtsimXwmFryyGKMD0yqKovINdF.jpg","credit_id":"65b4bb7412425c00ca47e60d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086880,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Malloy","original_name":"Mike Malloy","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":"/65rpBJYl90gqlLjQP2S4q7Pc9tg.jpg","credit_id":"65b4bbb02faf4d00e7dbb56d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4502652,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Joseph Dunn","original_name":"John Joseph Dunn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b4bbc858efd30163ca14df","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9817,"name":"behind the scenes"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":327874,"name":"the farmer"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"BEST SERVED COLD: How a Revenge Film was Buried for Decades (2024) Trailer","key":"rmuIBxYE-DU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-01-26T17:03:04.000Z","id":"65b4bb37f6596f0184fe3f05"}]}}}
