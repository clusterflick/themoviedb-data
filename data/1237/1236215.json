On screen, sensuality and sexuality, mythical and profane associations, motion and stationariness, framing, light, diaphragm and composition vie for supremacy. We see a boy in beautiful back lighting, the girl curling in the sunlight and we experience the existential and aesthetic inevitability of the physical contact. Herbert allows us to share the act of watching and paints his models like a portrait painter.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jumbo  Aqua","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Herbert","original_name":"James Herbert","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/sxHhmOV569ZQSxP3czQYVnRYIWJ.jpg","credit_id":"65b33bb75e14e501620bf792","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
