Dave Slade (Nicholas M. Garofolo) had walked off into the Coney Island, NY sunset with his soon to be bride and landlord, Mary Lee. Now all is awry. Unfortunately, the young lass did die at the hands of the same forces who tried to take Slade down in 2020. But instead of Terranova there is now Krasota (Karoline Fischer), a blonde bronze babe back to the future. Slade must now navigate his way with this new foe or as Old Man (Dave Sweeney) thinks she's a hoe. Slade and his ex-CIA cohort must now figure out the way out of this new challenge to make things right for themselves and the world at hand. Past, Present and Future. Blood spills and there are many thrills and chills. Tune in but don't tune out. The 1960's sensibilities live with the life and times of Dave Slade.","popularity":0.2008,"poster_path":"/kjxgu2fY0FBTd7uFqTksBsGm2zm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Dave Slade is back now to navigate his way with a new friend or foe.
