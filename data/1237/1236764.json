George soon becomes entangled in a manic chase throughout the city in one action packed night. In relentless pursuit is the mad and obsessive French biophysicist, Professor Henri Gautier and his two equally deranged henchmen, former Nazi rocket scientist, Doktor Werner Von Toller and a French Moroccan hit man, Fartouk Hahmesh. Armed with a '59 Chevrolet, a homemade radar tracking device and a laser gun, the evil trio hurl themselves at Leilah and George from all sides, carving up the late night city streets like a heat seeking missile.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1989-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wild Planet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2536306,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brendan Young","original_name":"Brendan Young","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/eRkUZ3wSZCfDe05R7OMDNp5WiuQ.jpg","credit_id":"65b4f76c2faf4d017cdc4009","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2536306,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brendan Young","original_name":"Brendan Young","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/eRkUZ3wSZCfDe05R7OMDNp5WiuQ.jpg","credit_id":"65b4f7716e0d720163472f1a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hofer Filmtage 1989","release_date":"1989-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
