Rick harvested an elk on the ancestral land of the Sinixt people in Vallican, British Columbia, Canada. To the Sinixt, hunting on ancestral land is an aboriginal right gifted to them by Creator. Itâ€™s a right that has legally been denied to the Sinixt people since 1956 when the Canadian government unjustly declared them extinct in Canada, despite the nearly 3,000 members existing on the Colville Indian Reservation in Washington State. Now with the Desautel Hunting Case, the Sinixt people have a chance to not only bring light to their unjust extinction by the Canadian government but also to abolish the declaration completely.","popularity":0.0971,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":73959,"logo_path":"/o4LDcUD1XPiPv32cCgeoBCz3d0G.png","name":"Vision Maker Media","origin_country":"US"},{"id":219304,"logo_path":null,"name":"a War Pony Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"We are Sinixt and we are still here.","title":"Older Than the Crown","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1912739,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Derrick LaMere","original_name":"Derrick LaMere","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b4071897fdec014a465d12","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4501714,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shelly Boyd","original_name":"Shelly Boyd","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b407319ba86a00bd2fbd0d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4501716,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Meghan Francis","original_name":"Meghan Francis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b4078f5541fa0131b13d03","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1912739,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Derrick LaMere","original_name":"Derrick LaMere","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b407b4a0f1a20161be89bd","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4501721,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Erin Joy Nash","original_name":"Erin Joy Nash","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b40824a06645017c8ddf43","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3759298,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Francene J.
