In 1953 Marcel Janco, a Romanian painter and a founder of the Dada movement, helped transform the village into a Jewish artists' colony, and renamed it Ein Hod. This documentary tells the story of the village's original inhabitants, who, after expulsion, settled only 1.5 kilometers away in the outlying hills. This new Ayn Hawd cannot be found on official maps, as Israeli law doesn't recognize it, and its residents, deemed \"present absentees\" by the authorities, do not receive basic services such as water, electricity or an access road. Rachel Leah Jones' filmmaking debut is a critical look at the art of dispossession and the creativity of the dispossessed.","popularity":0.2166,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"500 Dunam on the Moon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":930630,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rachel Leah Jones","original_name":"Rachel Leah Jones","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b5769d6e0d720163477003","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":930630,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rachel Leah Jones","original_name":"Rachel Leah Jones","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b5768f957e6d014ac547fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0448881","wikidata_id":"Q4639732","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":298655,"name":"palestine history"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
