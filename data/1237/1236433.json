He lives alone and works along his father to raise the family herd. From autumn to spring, he looks after his animals, feeds them and keeps them in the dense forests of holm oaks of French Pre-Alps. In the summer, he travels on foot for more than two hundred kilometres, leaving his father to lead the herd to the mountains pastures, in the High Alps Ubaye valley. There, he lives far from everything for many long months, in a mineral and inaccessible world where an invisible being prowls: the wolf. Against the tide of his time, Félix has chosen a profession that isolates him and keeps him out of the world.","popularity":0.406,"poster_path":"/wy56udxC3dd00BAYGP388lnFVC3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109953,"logo_path":"/s6V1B5qy7t2do8D3aVYwUZHIwxR.png","name":"Little Big
