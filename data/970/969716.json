The film follows Joey as he leads parallel lives—one as a co-director of the Two Spirit Society of Denver—and the other as a father attending the Mississippi wedding of his Pentecostal son. Joey’s words bridge the gap between the closeted person he was in Mississippi, and the Two Spirit activist he is today.","popularity":0.051,"poster_path":"/acbJXfUawh6QdsBUTq7DvGgXczx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Spirits","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3531288,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ruth Fertig","original_name":"Ruth Fertig","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626e0b67bf7744009fbd35c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1478361","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/acbJXfUawh6QdsBUTq7DvGgXczx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-06-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
