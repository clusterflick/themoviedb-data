Their arid land is pierced with blocks of color, each dwelling singular in a stylized way. Their resplendent clothing also boldly proclaims their identity. This unique film also explores Ndebele rituals never shown on film before. We see their fertility rites, a celebration that bonds them to their ancestral tradition. Ndebele performance art shows how traditional forms of expression can become a vehicle for political empowerment today. Nelson Mandela referred to the Ndebele as a 'Rainbow People.' Despite a history of racial oppression, forced removal from their ancestral land and economic privation, their pride and sense of joy has endured.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ndebele Women & The Rituals of Rebellion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3531018,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kelly Lilienfeld","original_name":"Kelly Lilienfeld","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626dc84538e510009b5ea3db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3531021,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Beynon","original_name":"Richard Beynon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626dc84f245dbe0065450c93","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
