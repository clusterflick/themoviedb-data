Independent film-makers worked with them to develop critical dialogue from one generation of concerned film-makers onto another. FILM-WORK looks at sequences from 4 of these films and interviews some of their makers, raising a diversity of issues pertinent to current debates in film, history and politics. The 4 films that are looked at are PENSIONS FOR VETERANS (1953, NSW Branch, WWF), THE HUNGRY MILES (1954, WWF), NOVEMBER VICTORY (1955, WWF), and HEWERS OF COAL (1953, Miners Federation). PENSIONS FOR VETERANS covers the issue of the need for pensions to be given to workers who have worked on the waterfront all their life. THE HUNGRY MILES shows the strength of the workers, the union and its democracy. HEWERS OF COAL is about the coal miners and their struggle to get better working conditions and pensions.","popularity":0.0885,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":174467,"logo_path":null,"name":"Waterside Workers Federation Film Unit","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Film-Work","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1583927,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norma Disher","original_name":"Norma Disher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"626d4ae62ac499009ff0cd21","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3475165,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Jerome 'Jock' Levy","original_name":"Jerome 'Jock' Levy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"626d4aec245dbe004f45bf30","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":235967,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Keith Gow","original_name":"Keith Gow","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"626d4af324b3330098319b5b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3530316,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Glenys Page","original_name":"Glenys Page","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626d4b6feec4f31197ca0f55","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3530318,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrew Duffield","original_name":"Andrew Duffield","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626d4b93d363e52f3658c727","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1322905,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Hughes","original_name":"John Hughes","popularity":0.0578,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626d4b477cffda31db6969d6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1322867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margot Nash","original_name":"Margot Nash","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/vjtsZqUg6DEMUKcFHTu26siLQzi.jpg","credit_id":"626d4b5024b3330098319d41","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1322905,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Hughes","original_name":"John Hughes","popularity":0.0578,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626d4b3cd363e52f350f70cb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3530319,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Lisa Parish","original_name":"Lisa Parish","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626d4b9dd363e52f350f724b","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1401737,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Whitteron","original_name":"John Whitteron","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626d4b7ee004a6009d48aae0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1401737,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Whitteron","original_name":"John Whitteron","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626d4b86e004a6009d48aaf3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ray Argall","original_name":"Ray Argall","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/hXKNP38ytokID6XBpAYlIEP4u9g.jpg","credit_id":"626d4bb5e004a6006877ddd7","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1322905,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Hughes","original_name":"John Hughes","popularity":0.0578,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6798795fb99d7e78c78f2b10","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
