The iconic highway—known for its retro diners, quirky motels, eclectic art installations and extraordinary landscapes—connects Chicago, Illinois to Santa Monica, California. On this day in 1926, the name “U.S. 66” was first proposed for the cross-country route.  The video—set to the classic music track \"Route 66\" by Bobby Troup—celebrates the cultural significance of one of America’s first national highways, and how it became a symbol of a changing nation.","popularity":0.3059,"poster_path":"/2Dk5zo4UTSLe6PTAHpFT4svdQ4Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119338,"logo_path":null,"name":"Google","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Celebrating Route 66","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3531140,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Matthew Cruickshank","original_name":"Matthew Cruickshank","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626dea9fc74eba2e0a65dcf5","department":"Art","job":"Creative Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3531140,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Matthew Cruickshank","original_name":"Matthew Cruickshank","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626deae8c56d2d11af27edfe","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3531142,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Madeline Belliveau","original_name":"Madeline Belliveau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626deaf7d363e52f374fbdfd","department":"Production","job":"Business Affairs Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3531143,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Colin Duffy","original_name":"Colin Duffy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626deb0b245dbe004f486249","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2304,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2Dk5zo4UTSLe6PTAHpFT4svdQ4Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1536}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3306,"name":"highway"},{"id":4944,"name":"route 66"},{"id":180307,"name":"driving"},{"id":204009,"name":"tourism"},{"id":287033,"name":"american history"},{"id":291865,"name":"united states of america (usa)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Celebrating Route 66","key":"ZoPJVcHYlU0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2022-04-29T16:46:04.000Z","id":"626dec08c74eba2e09d20b7d"}]}}}
