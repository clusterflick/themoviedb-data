At the heart of this concert is The Rite of Spring. Once decried, it is now a cornerstone of orchestral repertoire and considered by many to be the greatest work of the 20th century. Its elemental nature is best summed up by Stravinsky, who, in an unaccustomed moment of humilty, said that he didn’t feel he was the composer of the piece, but simply the vessel through which it passsed. Sir Simon Rattle says: ‘I’ve been conduting it since I was 19...it’s one of those pieces that reminds you what the shock of the new is about and it’s still one of the great challenges and one of the great thrills to perform.’","popularity":0.1357,"poster_path":"/hzmjTfrV5j30UmNGPymaX4NfDWB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126347,"logo_path":null,"name":"LSO Live","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"London Symphony Orchestra: Stravinsky","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Rattle","original_name":"Simon Rattle","popularity":0.2831,"profile_path":"/erFlB9B08lVMhEj70bLUpkr28iA.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"626cdde2eec4f300529a15d0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2922346,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"London Symphony Orchestra","original_name":"London Symphony Orchestra","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"626cdde9d363e50a56b7dbb3","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110453,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alban Berg","original_name":"Alban Berg","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/yumFeNQ8CwVu9qSL9JezxbFmcyU.jpg","credit_id":"626cde46d363e50a48e59410","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2770070,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anton Webern","original_name":"Anton Webern","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626cde572385130d96d9ba1b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1655425,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"György Ligeti","original_name":"György Ligeti","popularity":0.0739,"profile_path":"/bpOc7JQ6kj9J919dlln5coEk8uL.jpg","credit_id":"626cde37245dbe00993e7144","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":974330,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Igor Stravinsky","original_name":"Игорь Стравинский","popularity":0.1956,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626cde24c56d2d11b1367577","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1546145,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier Simonnet","original_name":"Olivier Simonnet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626cde016f43ec0068934b36","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1164,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hzmjTfrV5j30UmNGPymaX4NfDWB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":776}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
