All played with great comic effect by Jock Levy. Shot on the wharves at Walsh Bay, Sydney with the aim of educating workers that this type of behaviour damages the union and provides bosses and the media with an excuse to make baseless generalisations about all waterfront workers.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":174467,"logo_path":null,"name":"Waterside Workers Federation Film Unit","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Four's a Crowd","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3475165,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Jerome 'Jock' Levy","original_name":"Jerome 'Jock' Levy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Glass-arm Harry/Tiddly Pete/Nick-away Ned/Ron the Roaster","credit_id":"626d4945d363e52f374ce658","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3530308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonard Teale","original_name":"Leonard Teale","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"626d4a4dc56d2d11af252350","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1583927,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norma Disher","original_name":"Norma Disher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626d4969c74eba2e0a630e93","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3475165,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Jerome 'Jock' Levy","original_name":"Jerome 'Jock' Levy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626d4974d7107e2aa28ae2c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1583927,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norma Disher","original_name":"Norma Disher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626d4991d7107e2aa28ae341","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":235967,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Keith Gow","original_name":"Keith Gow","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626d4987eec4f31193ba9256","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":235967,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Keith Gow","original_name":"Keith Gow","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626d497de004a6009d48a1b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Four's A Crowd (1957)","key":"sHPicth7wo8","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2022-02-18T00:43:01.000Z","id":"626d49c7245dbe006542c399"}]}}}
