It explores the moral and emotional turmoil of Nigora, an Uzbek woman whose traditional life of being a housewife is turned upside down after her migrant husband fails to send back enough money and she finds out he has been having an affair. No longer able to rely on her husband, Nigora defies prevailing gender norms and sets to work fixing car tyres.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/aN5r8VRGLvEvzUd7NLGaqekDtq5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TJ","name":"Tajikistan"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Uzbek","iso_639_1":"uz","name":"ozbek"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Behind the Wheel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3529551,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elise Laker","original_name":"Elise Laker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626c7c61e3fa2f0a1fddb2ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3529551,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elise Laker","original_name":"Elise Laker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64522d2ed8f44e0dae95420b","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3529551,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elise Laker","original_name":"Elise Laker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64522d21d48cee0170254c21","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27660390","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aN5r8VRGLvEvzUd7NLGaqekDtq5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Molodist Kyiv International Film Festival","release_date":"2014-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Behind the Wheel | Πίσω απο το Τιμόνι","key":"112586156","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2014-11-22T20:15:41.000Z","id":"64522d7cc0442900e2f0b38a"}]}}}
