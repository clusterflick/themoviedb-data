At the center of this controversy is glyphosate, the primary active ingredient in Monsantoâ€™s Roundup, the most widely used herbicide in the world. Glyphosate was recently identified as a possible cancer causing agent and is now found in breast milk, baby food, wine and 80% of food grown in the United States.  Why is glyphosate filtering into so many facets of our daily lives? And why are countries banning glyphosate while the United States uses more of it than any other country in the world? Children Of The Vine will peel back the curtain on the flawed regulatory practices that are causing more harm than good to public health while also revealing the scary science behind toxic farming practices. In the end, this solution driven documentary will highlight more sustainable large scale farming practices capable of feeding the world.","popularity":0.3997,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children Of The Vine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1046125,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian Lilla","original_name":"Brian Lilla","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626ce0712ac499009fefd80d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18378,"name":"pesticide"},{"id":163206,"name":"public health"},{"id":182281,"name":"farming"},{"id":237123,"name":"herbicide"},{"id":296210,"name":"farming practices"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
