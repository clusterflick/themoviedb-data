Communities are not just bound by borders – they are often comprised of people with shared passions. A friendly local game store (FLGS) is a unique place where people can connect with each other, create memories, and build community. Celebrating over 40 years of operation, the Sentry Box in Calgary, Alberta has grown to become the world’s largest game store. It has achieved this incredible milestone by being an inviting and welcoming space for people of all backgrounds to enjoy table top games, such as Dungeons and Dragons. The documentary from CUFF alumnus and Calgarian Garry Snow shares the unique history of the Sentry Box by interviewing the owner, long-time customers, current and former employees, and local industry influencers who have all been connected by the friendly local game store.","popularity":0.3329,"poster_path":"/ubB6tOxaf1WZK60Ijuxpqzd8ioH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2022-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Friendly Local Game Store","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3530446,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gordon Johansen","original_name":"Gordon Johansen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"626dbcf3245dbe006544dd14","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3530445,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Garry Snow","original_name":"Garry Snow","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626d5fd724b333009831fe6c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3530445,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Garry Snow","original_name":"Garry Snow","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626dbd06d7107e2aa28ce124","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"diekugames","instagram_id":"diekugames","twitter_id":"diekugames"},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":933,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ubB6tOxaf1WZK60Ijuxpqzd8ioH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10090,"name":"board game"},{"id":163150,"name":"toy store"},{"id":215568,"name":"small business"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Calgary Underground Film Festival","release_date":"2022-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Friendly Local Game Store Documentary","key":"ghLiFZ3EHsg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-10-23T19:47:19.000Z","id":"626d5faee004a60068784284"}]}}}
