This film, shot in black and white and hand developed, evokes a bygone era through texture and tone, while interview commentary meanders between yearnings to preserve the millennia-old tradition and complex discussions of the arbitrary nature of borders. Through the telling of Scottish-English fishing rivalries, water is revered and imbued with power beyond tools and industry â€“ it is the tide that dictates the line in the Solway Firth between the two countries.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/rIxTeJPCT7MD1WxpTeZ3w7azdXV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"HAAF","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2622153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julia Parks","original_name":"Julia Parks","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626bd4572385130d96d572c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rIxTeJPCT7MD1WxpTeZ3w7azdXV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
