In “Given Away,” this week’s moving new Op-Doc by directors Glenn and Julie Morey, Korean adoptees who grew up in Western countries reflect on the complicated emotional terrain that they’ve navigated in their lives.  Glenn Morey was himself adopted from Korea in the wake of the Korean war, and the directors have channeled that connection to create a beautifully nuanced and emotional film. As the Moreys write of Glenn’s experience interviewing adoptees, “He has needed others like him … to help him make sense of his life. They have also helped him make peace with the universe.”","popularity":0.422,"poster_path":"/dNxb9J7KLxcE0QehMOFb7Ac61li.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32686,"logo_path":"/6sDPxaKC0rGfxeWueXsYXu5YlDU.png","name":"The New York Times","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"“One of the last things that my grandmother said was, ‘When you grow up, come visit me.’”","title":"Given Away","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"I Was Adopted From Korea — Here’s What It Was Like","type":"YouTube"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Given Away: Korean Adoptees Share Their Stories","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3529790,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Glenn Morey","original_name":"Glenn Morey","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626cbfcbea37e000656c9601","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3529791,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julie Morey","original_name":"Julie Morey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626cbfdad363e50a48e54237","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2304,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dNxb9J7KLxcE0QehMOFb7Ac61li.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1536}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2393,"name":"adoption"},{"id":186764,"name":"korean minority"},{"id":231519,"name":"korean american"},{"id":241445,"name":"asian origins"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"I Was Adopted From Korea — Here’s What It Was Like | Op-Docs","key":"xeIC1detnD8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2019-07-29T23:00:05.000Z","id":"626cbc33c74eba0e29265df6"}]}}}
