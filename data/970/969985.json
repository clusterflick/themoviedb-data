Mass media childbirth vs the real thing","overview":"100 video clips contrast real and fictional birth scenes, from the silly to the sublime. Anthropologist Vicki Elson shares highlights from her collection of TV and movie birth scenes -- in hospitals, bathtubs, cars, spaceships, and trees -- side by side with ample footage of actual birth. The contrast is hilarious, engaging, and enlightening. 'Unique, hip, and lovable!' Diana Paul, MotherBaby International Film Festival 'The only childbirth video that makes people laugh -- a lot!' Debby Takikawa, BABY! International Film Festival 'An intelligent and well-executed film. Useful and accessible.' Jane Pincus, founder, Our Bodies, Ourselves 'Equally fitting for the art house, the seventh grade health education class, or the graduate lecture series.' Liz O'Dair, MD 'Amazing!'
