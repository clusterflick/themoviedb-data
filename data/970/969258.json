As we watch her going about her daily chores, rhythmically threshing the millet, cooking over an open fire, she tells us of her aspirations. Her strongest wish is for adequate food, good health, and to remain close to her family Images of Western life have not penetrated her village which is three hours from a paved road. This cinematically beautiful film captures life in the dry season which lasts nine months. Cows and goats share the dusty landscape. Villagers trek great distances to bring back the heavy load of water for daily needs. Although life is difficult, there is a dignity about the people.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Portrait of Altine in the Dry Season","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3529579,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Mensa","original_name":"Marco Mensa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626c8139245dbe004f434d94","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3529578,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elisa Mereghetti","original_name":"Elisa Mereghetti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626c81282385130d97094e50","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
