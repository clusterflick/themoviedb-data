The sea is up to 32 meters deep and the waves are high even in good weather. A wind park with 80 turbines is being built here under harsh conditions, which will generate climate-friendly electricity for a million people. A mammoth project that is hard to beat in terms of size and complexity. And things are progressing rapidly: specialists erect the almost 150-meter-high wind turbines within a day.","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":"/jPQ1Mr219h7wAb5bK7uOoF3NtgZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138741,"logo_path":null,"name":"WELT","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wind Farm Assembly- Off The Coast Of Sylt - Millimeter Work In All Weathers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jPQ1Mr219h7wAb5bK7uOoF3NtgZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
