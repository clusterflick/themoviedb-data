Using the latest technology in HD aerial photography, this WQED Multimedia production takes you up in the air -- over neighborhoods, rivers and forests, inside the exploding spectacle of July 4th fireworks - to capture stunning aerial views of one of America's most vibrant regions.  This is Western Pennsylvania at work and play -- in its glorious green seasons and in the cold, crystalline beauty of winter light.  This is Pittsburgh from the Air.","popularity":0.1292,"poster_path":"/hs7EXCNAwnUa1imFakcclHcX0kT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16021,"logo_path":"/2bjAiWiyI4nUWzxLcnGejDO0amC.png","name":"WQED","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's Pittsburgh like you've never seen it before!","title":"Pittsburgh From the Air","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":974481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Sebak","original_name":"Rick Sebak","popularity":0.1465,"profile_path":"/8eYRrrzkY9co4nza7gP0hPwQ9Tb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"(Narrator)","credit_id":"626ede4acb71b813f8fdd915","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1074647,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephen Stept","original_name":"Stephen Stept","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626ede6d68ff7000524e9d6d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1074647,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephen Stept","original_name":"Stephen Stept","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626ede8b1fd36f0050a1be12","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1669797,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Cherokee Walker","original_name":"Cherokee Walker","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626edee665e0a20052607ce6","department":"Crew","job":"Aerial Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2656138,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Frank Caloiero","original_name":"Frank Caloiero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626edefad7107e4aa127cb69","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2656138,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Frank Caloiero","original_name":"Frank Caloiero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626edf13d7107e4aa0ce1231","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2658717,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rebecca Born","original_name":"Rebecca Born","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626edf297cffda5109bf745b","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hs7EXCNAwnUa1imFakcclHcX0kT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
