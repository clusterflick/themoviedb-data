In reviewing the footage afterwards, we discovered that the most memorable events were the interactions of the children with the off-camera adults. We therefore put together a tape that illustrates children's fragile and often stubborn re-interpretation of what adults expect of them. The tape is embroidered with vignettes (filmed on Super-8 as home-movies) of the same children at play.\" -B.A.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Talk, Kids","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3403734,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Byron Ayanoglu","original_name":"Byron Ayanoglu","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626e06a03c434400a9e096a0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
