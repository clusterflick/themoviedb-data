There seems to be a spell on these minorities, an evil spell, despite which life must go on. This tape, tells a straight forward story (which in reality is an allegory) about two lesbians and their attempt to cure themselves of the \"spell\". They are aided by a gay man (which allows for comments on the ongoing rivalry between gays and lesbians), and they find their salvation in the hands of a benevolent dancer/witch in Mexico.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chichenitz Ah","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3403734,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Byron Ayanoglu","original_name":"Byron Ayanoglu","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626e073fc56d2d11b13a9d63","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
