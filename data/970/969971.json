Bain's computer-manipulated images of this mechanical sculpture - which, like the tape, comes across as the creation of a contemporary and lyrical constructivist - are combined with differing, machine-like sounds. The pulsating image is dynamic, and constantly changing in colour and tempo. The sound, which appears to have been injected directly into the electronic, abstracted images, both influences and directs the image, and vice-versa. Ultimately this gives rise to a form of synthesis whereby the seperate elements fuse together into a surprising and alternative single entity, which reaches, and intrigues, our senses as 'Electrophase', a new 'synthetic achine environment'.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/moWNAllJgkckI4rMoMzDfiptm7z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Electrophase","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3532320,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Bain","original_name":"Mark Bain","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626eed99c74eba2e0a698155","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/moWNAllJgkckI4rMoMzDfiptm7z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
