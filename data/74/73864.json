The story of Alexander's childhood is also the history of an era, the fifties and sixties, and a never solved murder case. Murder goes back to an authentic incident: in 1956, right before Christmas, a policeman was shot in broad daylight in Maassluis during a large-scale evangelistic campaign. The film also plays a failed escape attempt with a herring trawler involved in the turbulent days of May 1940.","popularity":0.4535,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2006-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rage of the Whole World","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":570351,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maarten Heijmans","original_name":"Maarten Heijmans","popularity":0.1116,"profile_path":"/1ykcid5vioZL2GnqepKv6Cp2k49.jpg","cast_id":1000,"character":"Alex Goudveyl","credit_id":"52fe48aec3a368484e105759","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":211055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bart de Vries","original_name":"Bart de Vries","popularity":0.1156,"profile_path":"/wgs7Iml7usK7rOnAWsIvLzbpOnQ.jpg","cast_id":1001,"character":"Aaron Oberstein","credit_id":"52fe48aec3a368484e10575d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":460363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivienne van den Assem","original_name":"Vivienne van den Assem","popularity":0.1825,"profile_path":"/nvg17OCSIFldqGa48qiEhcn3vl0.jpg","cast_id":1002,"character":"Ruth Oberstein","credit_id":"52fe48aec3a368484e105761","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cees Geel","original_name":"Cees Geel","popularity":0.1801,"profile_path":"/clLwUanbbYrEWOm10lG254Muxgu.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"Joost Vroom","credit_id":"52fe48aec3a368484e105765","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":211159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esther Way","original_name":"Esther Way","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/vGJr4GkzqK6nKS6glODIeU3v0ux.jpg","cast_id":1004,"character":"Yvonne Varekamp","credit_id":"52fe48aec3a368484e105769","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":239573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Speller","original_name":"Anna Speller","popularity":0.1134,"profile_path":"/iX4AfhdkOIOe3qlu2vPDm4mTS5D.jpg","cast_id":1005,"character":"Joanna Overstein","credit_id":"52fe48aec3a368484e10576d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Lammers","original_name":"Frank Lammers","popularity":0.5959,"profile_path":"/rGIikThUCilyt8rgHkeJAxxEhCO.jpg","cast_id":1006,"character":"Inspecteur Douvetrap","credit_id":"52fe48aec3a368484e105771","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":211304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Drost","original_name":"Peter Drost","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":"/wp9sdz9nvx0V0bjtX8OClGUd5k0.jpg","cast_id":1007,"character":"Vader Goudveyl","credit_id":"52fe48aec3a368484e105775","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":211223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ottolien Boeschoten","original_name":"Ottolien Boeschoten","popularity":0.0843,"profile_path":"/nVJN99vLo2Suyf2eMikXmubx1AI.jpg","cast_id":1008,"character":"Moeder Goudveyl","credit_id":"52fe48aec3a368484e105779","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":233931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joost Prinsen","original_name":"Joost Prinsen","popularity":0.1898,"profile_path":"/kei7afrBZxfbzYHLMUkfvxm1Gs8.jpg","cast_id":1009,"character":"Inspecteur Graswinckel","credit_id":"52fe48aec3a368484e10577d","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":108632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miryanna van Reeden","original_name":"Miryanna van Reeden","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":"/gmUFF0xOx1AyDtzphOR46OAVdF2.jpg","cast_id":1010,"character":"Maria Minderhout","credit_id":"52fe48aec3a368484e105781","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":570352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Pieters","original_name":"Kim Pieters","popularity":0.105,"profile_path":"/iMsbRept9OMnKB6zLHYHgED6iyv.jpg","cast_id":1011,"character":"Alice van Essen","credit_id":"52fe48aec3a368484e105785","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114387,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guido Pieters","original_name":"Guido Pieters","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48aec3a368484e10578b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1248462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maarten 't Hart","original_name":"Maarten 't Hart","popularity":0.0599,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"552d2c82c3a3684ad6000a53","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0393354","wikidata_id":"Q2015889","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
