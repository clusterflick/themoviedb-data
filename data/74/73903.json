As scientists and beekeepers search for the cause, Colony captures the struggle within the beekeeping community to save the honeybee and themselves. Colony documents a time of unprecedented crisis in the world of the honeybee through the eyes of both veteran beekeeper, David Mendes, and Lance and Victor Seppi, two young brothers getting into beekeeping when most are getting out. As Mendes tries to save the nation's collapsing hives, the Seppi's try to keep their business alive amidst a collapsing economy.","popularity":0.1897,"poster_path":"/ct9oxiye9SEb4FK6yuIibttv30V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Endangered World of Bees","title":"Colony","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1980191,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carter Gunn","original_name":"Carter Gunn","popularity":0.1095,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a88a0b09251410a89056b55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1771319,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ross McDonnell","original_name":"Ross McDonnell","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/5JvhIpisSnw1a0QTDrBTx2jx6g9.jpg","credit_id":"5a88a0ba9251410a1f055cc2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1480655","wikidata_id":"Q5148485","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ct9oxiye9SEb4FK6yuIibttv30V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1063}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
