She and her boy friend, Ronnie, devise a plan to lure Darman to her apartment, where she gives him a drugged drink. She tells Darman they had been intimate and blackmails him for $50,000. More than a little distracted by his situation, his wife senses something is wrong and he gets into a violent argument with his father-in-law who owns the producing company Darman works for, and discontinues the picture. Sherry informs Darman she is going to tell his wife all about them. Darman tells his secretary that he is going to work late and is not to be disturbed, sets the moviola runnings, and exits by the back door and hot-foots it to Sherry's apartment.","popularity":0.7203,"poster_path":"/taGFESqIbjVbtM2F9uAiPSRIVnR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5296,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hugo Haas Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1954-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Every Man She Touched - She Destroyed!","title":"The Other Woman","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugo Haas","original_name":"Hugo Haas","popularity":0.247,"profile_path":"/mPbmTlrSRnPALznF0Q4tNXdo63D.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Walter Darman","credit_id":"52fe4897c3a368484e101007","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":94199,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cleo Moore","original_name":"Cleo Moore","popularity":0.1535,"profile_path":"/uM4cIvTfilEYelVRCFkrC3ogEkW.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Sherry Steward","credit_id":"52fe4897c3a368484e10100b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lance Fuller","original_name":"Lance Fuller","popularity":0.2021,"profile_path":"/mwVv57nP36YgbMFTEAcqOWPDidj.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Ronnie","credit_id":"52fe4897c3a368484e10100f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":142440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucille Barkley","original_name":"Lucille Barkley","popularity":0.1756,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Mrs. Lucille Darman","credit_id":"52fe4897c3a368484e101013","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":568909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Macy","original_name":"Jack Macy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Charles Lester","credit_id":"52fe4897c3a368484e101017","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Qualen","original_name":"John Qualen","popularity":0.4488,"profile_path":"/aMuzXYaBmblQm95JxHZrmseeIYh.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Papasha","credit_id":"52fe4897c3a368484e10101b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan Arvan","original_name":"Jan Arvan","popularity":0.2318,"profile_path":"/djff9Pen3LjmUQyBUolEs2dzSDI.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Police Inspector Collins","credit_id":"52fe4897c3a368484e10101f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":134634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karolee Kelly","original_name":"Karolee Kelly","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Marion","credit_id":"52fe4897c3a368484e101023","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Mitchell","original_name":"Steve Mitchell","popularity":0.4473,"profile_path":"/aMs3QkRmgrHOsZHqgfj7QCEYv1q.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"1st Assistant Director","credit_id":"52fe4897c3a368484e101027","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2505005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Lowell","original_name":"Mark Lowell","popularity":0.0947,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"2nd Assistant Director","credit_id":"52fe4897c3a368484e10102b","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":112011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melinda Markey","original_name":"Melinda Markey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Actress","credit_id":"52fe4897c3a368484e10102f","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":137204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carol Kelly","original_name":"Carol Kelly","popularity":0.0748,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Marion","credit_id":"64c2d5cb9590e300c8d1daa2","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugo Haas","original_name":"Hugo Haas","popularity":0.247,"profile_path":"/mPbmTlrSRnPALznF0Q4tNXdo63D.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4897c3a368484e100fe5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17911,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Eddie Fitzgerald","original_name":"Eddie Fitzgerald","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4897c3a368484e100ffd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":69815,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Robert S.
