It homes in on the daily life of a father with a daughter whose hands and feet are deformed. “Animal Farm” relies on the rough-and-ready feel of stop-motion clay animation to create a satire of bullying and mob dynamics. “At Her House” paints a devastating picture of gender inequality within a marriage. “Flesh and Bone” gently pillories superficiality and the obsession with outward appearance. “Bicycle Trip” focuses on the discrimination experienced by foreign workers in Korea. “Be a Human Being” looks at the way young Koreans are barely treated as human beings before they get to university.","popularity":0.1736,"poster_path":"/xiNrPUYe3SLddM2gCtKInFzmJET.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79498,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chungeorahm Film","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":112448,"logo_path":"/i2Buhtxe5wshqAtRn7MpF38LEyt.png","name":"National Human Rights Commission of Korea","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2005-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"If You Were Me: Anima Vision","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1977828,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kwon Oh-sung","original_name":"Kwon Oh-sung","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a83d2990e0a26401100c8ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1977826,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yu Jin-hee","original_name":"Yu Jin-hee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a83cf95925141759900a0a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1977829,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Joon","original_name":"Kim Joon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a83d4240e0a26401100ca41","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1978288,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Jin-suk","original_name":"Lee Jin-suk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a84f66c925141759901b33b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1978286,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jung Yeon-joo","original_name":"Jung Yeon-joo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a84f4ec9251410b01015ca1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1978285,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Park Yun-kyung","original_name":"Park Yun-kyung","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a84f3019251410a89017432","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1978875,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Ae-rim","original_name":"Lee Ae-rim","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a860d2c0e0a264011038b03","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228278,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Sung-gang","original_name":"Lee Sung-gang","popularity":0.1222,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a862222c3a36862e102c82f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1978924,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Park Jae-dong","original_name":"Park Jae-dong","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a862078c3a36862a702a213","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937484,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oh Sung-yoon","original_name":"Oh Sung-yoon","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9742290e0a260153006c02","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":938902,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chang Hyung-yun","original_name":"Chang Hyung-yun","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ba774a8c3a3680e50029da2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2877161,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Son Yeong-hwa","original_name":"Son Yeong-hwa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc61b852fdec6003b79f5b8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13545090","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":861,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/xiNrPUYe3SLddM2gCtKInFzmJET.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":574}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18339,"name":"human rights"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"2005-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
