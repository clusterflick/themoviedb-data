It's all around in nature. Only birds and man can sing; man \"sings\" even when he speaks. We see a quick survey of the stages of life, as captured by songs: the alphabet song for primary school, Here Comes the Bride, The Old Gray Mare, etc. Some inspirations for song are outlined in song: love, sailing, trains, the West, motherhood, etc., but \"we never sing about brains.\" Finally, an example of how a simple melody can be expanded into a symphony: an elaborate version of the simple tune that opened the lesson","popularity":0.4874,"poster_path":"/jOqHx8ScjyPabGVefIF2lCW5RDt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney
