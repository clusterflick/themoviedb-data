Despite her attempts, Rosalba's persistent attempts to convert him to the rituals of high society, enlightened, or feminine tastes do little more than annoy him.\r Strongly determined to build a stable relationship with a woman who can fulfill his visions of peaceful married life, he leaves for the Amazon, where he is offered the opportunity to choose and buy a new wife as a slave. The choice falls on the beautiful and docile Manua that he trains to act the way he'd like, then proudly shows to friends and to his former wife, attracting curiosity, envy, and his ex-wife's resentment.","popularity":0.3319,"poster_path":"/1ETYLc4nCZ25VvG6kz4kCpJIlec.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1973-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Darling Slave","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lando Buzzanca","original_name":"Lando Buzzanca","popularity":0.4873,"profile_path":"/pVfDFDQGYtlFNifGEMW16pQktFu.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Demetrio Cultura","credit_id":"52fe488ac3a368484e0fe1a9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":70119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Spaak","original_name":"Catherine Spaak","popularity":0.5698,"profile_path":"/5kiWPIlbNrpOCUxoDwrkKQLjqVJ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Rosalba","credit_id":"52fe488ac3a368484e0fe1ad","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":44110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adriana Asti","original_name":"Adriana Asti","popularity":0.5826,"profile_path":"/kYZa3wNA2Ncyk3QZTvZo02spqUy.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Elena","credit_id":"52fe488ac3a368484e0fe1b1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":567990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Veronica Merin","original_name":"Veronica Merin","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Manua","credit_id":"52fe488ac3a368484e0fe1b5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gordon Mitchell","original_name":"Gordon Mitchell","popularity":0.4274,"profile_path":"/egzMP5LPg6WiO45nSGlOyfhaTsb.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Von Thirac","credit_id":"571092c2925141763e000a25","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gianni Bonagura","original_name":"Gianni Bonagura","popularity":0.1975,"profile_path":"/7IPaeFBBM9EHxmB7WjemUixCNDX.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Balzarini","credit_id":"57109323c3a36860a8003e21","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33717,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giorgio Capitani","original_name":"Giorgio Capitani","popularity":0.2299,"profile_path":"/4rZqvpJHZiOPB6ZZz9Jeeyhsu3c.jpg","credit_id":"52fe488ac3a368484e0fe187","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21228,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sandro Continenza","original_name":"Sandro Continenza","popularity":0.1874,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe488ac3a368484e0fe18d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":567989,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Giulio Scarnicci","original_name":"Giulio Scarnicci","popularity":0.0729,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe488ac3a368484e0fe193","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raimondo Vianello","original_name":"Raimondo Vianello","popularity":0.3094,"profile_path":"/nSx9vQ3PH9f4ooXgDFrBR0zhchC.jpg","credit_id":"52fe488ac3a368484e0fe199","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91546,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Piero Umiliani","original_name":"Piero Umiliani","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/fvUySwSc1IzL1OmO6biTUWDSzi0.jpg","credit_id":"52fe488ac3a368484e0fe19f","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553861,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alessandro D'Eva","original_name":"Alessandro D'Eva","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe488ac3a368484e0fe1a5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0069230","wikidata_id":"Q3824030","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/1ETYLc4nCZ25VvG6kz4kCpJIlec.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
