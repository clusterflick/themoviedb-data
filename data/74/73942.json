He meets a waitress who's also seen her share of trouble and they start up a tenuous relationship. Then there's a murder and things get complicated. It's noir so the plot isn't the main focus but the mood of the film is consistent and properly downbeat. The characters can't seem to shake the fate that hangs over them.","popularity":1.6039,"poster_path":"/g6sNFJImU8BIUsiHkViDqiohHYc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39224,"logo_path":null,"name":"Imageworks Entertainment International","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Box - 2003","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Russo","original_name":"James Russo","popularity":1.0576,"profile_path":"/nubhNb5OUkzsrndD1BNqzp7MGyo.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Frank Miles","credit_id":"52fe48b4c3a368484e106745","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theresa Russell","original_name":"Theresa Russell","popularity":0.5695,"profile_path":"/v0s86Nh5IMqYk5oazosuAwXAiO5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dora Baker","credit_id":"52fe48b4c3a368484e106749","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brad Dourif","original_name":"Brad Dourif","popularity":1.5961,"profile_path":"/o9f0fHMF1Jo0PDCjz2r1dneolwS.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Stan","credit_id":"6146275aed28b90042c668d7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1055951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Parra","original_name":"Mark Parra","popularity":0.1213,"profile_path":"/p8TczVIB6aeVh2tPOgKVlphalIr.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Steve","credit_id":"6146276185da120020bb4cbf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Railsback","original_name":"Steve Railsback","popularity":0.5162,"profile_path":"/wztkAOAQZNGLlbrUrGIhV5cr1S0.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jake Ragna","credit_id":"6146276cdaf57c002c90dd1c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Polito","original_name":"Jon Polito","popularity":0.4079,"profile_path":"/4HjxMy4Ir2dWz7ycX5l3sgxOY4g.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Michael Dickerson","credit_id":"61462773daf57c004365e12f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Rooker","original_name":"Michael Rooker","popularity":2.6371,"profile_path":"/dq3xFKDWJsQjPffm1bmB3TbMilq.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Detective Stafford","credit_id":"6146277e1b70ae0042749925","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":152408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Snyder","original_name":"John Snyder","popularity":0.2288,"profile_path":"/oRdYmwMqEoseT1C539KHYw0AjiK.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Detective Miller","credit_id":"6146278aed28b90042c6693d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Weaver","original_name":"Lee Weaver","popularity":0.371,"profile_path":"/xg1t80JugQ6zWbnoRxbnCW1kUa4.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Joe","credit_id":"614627922dffd800921343db","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1702507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Palese","original_name":"Joe Palese","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Mike Jennings","credit_id":"6146279f9450fe0064f9db4e","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2156916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucille M.
