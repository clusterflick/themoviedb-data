To challenge the past. To accept the present. To decide the future. Sam arrives in his home town after 18 months away, hopeful that Meg, the girlfriend he abandoned, will go back with him to the city. His return brings the outside world into the parochial confines of the town, provoking mixed reactions which fuel conflict. Meg, heartbroken when Sam left her, has begun an affair with Sam's friend Johnny. On the eve of Sam's arrival, Johnny asks Meg to marry him. The marriage proposal, along with Sam's unexpected return, forces Meg to choose not only between the two men but also the type of life she wants. The conflicting loyalties and emotions generated by the triangle provide the focus for an array of inter-related characters enmeshed in the life of this country town. There is a feeling of impending tragedy as night falls and Johnny becomes increasingly desparate.","popularity":0.8439,"poster_path":"/7p4MfCHOUNT5U0ErWzQhBBlZlIv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27110,"logo_path":"/9cEnyvjE2SGatjwPY9WigJqBnGM.png","name":"Beyond Productions","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1990-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Where destiny meets desire.","title":"The Crossing","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Mammone","original_name":"Robert Mammone","popularity":0.4207,"profile_path":"/6R2xAV1tpJow5mLUmewOdtDA2Rg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"52fe48acc3a368484e104dcd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":266189,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danielle Spencer","original_name":"Danielle Spencer","popularity":0.2172,"profile_path":"/yknlQ0eaG6Kz6TFephH93AdddXw.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Meg","credit_id":"52fe48acc3a368484e104dd1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russell Crowe","original_name":"Russell Crowe","popularity":4.9196,"profile_path":"/fbzD4utSGJlsV8XbYMLoMdEZ1Fc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Johnny","credit_id":"52fe48acc3a368484e104dd5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1322337,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Lumbers","original_name":"Emily Lumbers","popularity":0.0871,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Jenny","credit_id":"543ec1fac3a3684fe600009f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2708273,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodney Bell","original_name":"Rodney Bell","popularity":0.1204,"profile_path":"/8kUhGYrTUQHkPSf6rj0qVvvIYTx.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Shorty","credit_id":"5f08b8691f98d100361a0c49","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57433,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Ogilvie","original_name":"George Ogilvie","popularity":0.0901,"profile_path":"/cUUUQ0KdIiFdQIJWgx7rRRLFLVs.jpg","credit_id":"543ec21ac3a3684fd10000c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1322359,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ranald Allan","original_name":"Ranald Allan","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"543ec226c3a3684fd50000bf","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0099323","wikidata_id":"Q7728178","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.695,"height":835,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7p4MfCHOUNT5U0ErWzQhBBlZlIv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":580}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":246,"name":"dancing"},{"id":9713,"name":"friends"},{"id":13008,"name":"train"},{"id":13063,"name":"car accident"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"M","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Crossing Trailer 1992","key":"olCFUtIIuws","published_at":"2014-10-15T02:06:54.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"543ec2720e0a2667480000a8"}]}}}
