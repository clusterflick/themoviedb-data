Trendy power chords and 5000 vocal tracks in the chorus involved sopping metal hymns and arenas with topless teens. It is not easy to be a legend. No matter what you do, no matter how much you change and you deliver qualitative work you are always in the eye of the critics and are measured against the famous classics. \"Def Leppard\" are not an exception. The hard rock institution from Sheffield delivered with \"Pyromania\" and \"Hysteria\" two groundbreaking albums in the 80s - million seller.","popularity":0.8399,"poster_path":"/425RscHQhwAX91eTufxNc9SKS15.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Def Leppard - Live in Sheffield","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Savage","original_name":"Rick Savage","popularity":0.2149,"profile_path":"/h45AZA3vFPH2zsd8jEFX6NuiI9A.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself - Bass, Backing Vocals, Additional Guitars, Keyboards","credit_id":"551add82c3a3687669000211","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Elliott","original_name":"Joe Elliott","popularity":0.2923,"profile_path":"/gOwf3IiQkQBwnd9oDrZpjENyUdj.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself - Lead Vocals, Additional Guitars, Keyboards, Piano","credit_id":"551add93c3a368767d0001d9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":200060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Allen","original_name":"Rick Allen","popularity":0.1659,"profile_path":"/lfboPtsJipz2OAzkUmMiqMJbJEB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself - Drums, Percussion, Backing Vocals","credit_id":"551adda7c3a368766c000222","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":232724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Collen","original_name":"Phil Collen","popularity":0.3252,"profile_path":"/3VXV5E6RXN4pknRqydoiZt4DxC.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself - Guitars, Backing Vocals","credit_id":"551addb79251414aed0001e1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":232739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivian Campbell","original_name":"Vivian Campbell","popularity":0.3184,"profile_path":"/rizkCgiqNrRP5DfY5E3LftCehCM.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself - Guitars, Backing Vocals","credit_id":"551addc69251414aed0001e3","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/425RscHQhwAX91eTufxNc9SKS15.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3pO3Unbpc4BBR3pujvZk4mBlVFl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
