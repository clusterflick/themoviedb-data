But just as they appeared to be getting a really break big, they just disappeared. Thirty years later, a cable TV reporter for MIX TV, a musical station, is removed from her show because of being stoned on air. Her station gives her a choice of being dismissed or investigating what happened to Sweetwater. A blending of modern day fiction and past fact is then blended in this biographical story.","popularity":1.6013,"poster_path":"/wJdj1QEWTQBUV5MdZ6kEHa5X8Wj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sweetwater","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Sweetwater: A True Rock Story","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":56895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amy Jo Johnson","original_name":"Amy Jo Johnson","popularity":0.8673,"profile_path":"/mgMtXlgOjEIvpndGFQo5TuuFKjC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Nansi Nevins","credit_id":"52fe4894c3a368484e100399","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":95468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelli Williams","original_name":"Kelli Williams","popularity":1.3666,"profile_path":"/6P8MzCm2rgBJFVciaka2r6E6TIt.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Cami Carlson","credit_id":"5b8f16170e0a267f59002094","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60721,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kurt Max Runte","original_name":"Kurt Max Runte","popularity":0.2264,"profile_path":"/8WGPyDSfIqSYLeS525VifPHfHlL.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Alex Del Zoppo","credit_id":"5b8f1625c3a36837f1001e6b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Moloney","original_name":"Robert Moloney","popularity":0.4742,"profile_path":"/gbmYYq0R6xvuKZQ1kwUBwkN9iso.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Fred Herrera","credit_id":"5b8f1634925141739400299e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1753322,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nancy Moonves","original_name":"Nancy Moonves","popularity":0.1484,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mrs. Nevins","credit_id":"5b8f164692514173b2001c0a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":276478,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Anthony Rawlins","original_name":"Michael Anthony Rawlins","popularity":0.1381,"profile_path":"/yI11koCnxcpQdbwYp5EyIBRGZDu.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Ian","credit_id":"5b8f16690e0a267f61001d88","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Ant","original_name":"Adam Ant","popularity":0.3037,"profile_path":"/d0VTssBcN9sTXFdSU49NDi0MBsf.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Todd Badham","credit_id":"5b8f167bc3a3683807001c9d","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":56895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amy Jo Johnson","original_name":"Amy Jo Johnson","popularity":0.8673,"profile_path":"/mgMtXlgOjEIvpndGFQo5TuuFKjC.jpg","credit_id":"6303b775e86017007c6b6216","department":"Sound","job":"Songs"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64196,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joel Goodman","original_name":"Joel Goodman","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655e9e572b113d00ada253a6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32876,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bernard Couture","original_name":"Bernard Couture","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655e9e221d356300c40889e6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24954,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jay Ferguson","original_name":"Jay Ferguson","popularity":0.1204,"profile_path":"/xvMJGdtcVV0DZMCyWXUPgtFJ7xN.jpg","credit_id":"655e9e84180dea00ad81b83b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":398769,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Victoria Wozniak","original_name":"Victoria Wozniak","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655e9dfa1dbc88011ea4f1b9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1081808,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joanne D'Antonio","original_name":"Joanne D'Antonio","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655e9e3c7dfda600ac20ea30","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":534087,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lorraine Senna","original_name":"Lorraine Senna","popularity":0.1418,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55be4efe9251413e51004dbc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1331947,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael G.
