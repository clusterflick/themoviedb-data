In \"The Day Off\", Ah Nan (John Cheng) and Ah Lei (Wang Lei) goes for their annual in-camp training and they meet a very \"on\" Platoon Commander. As they're about to play a prank on the Commander as a form of revenge for all the rigorous training they had to put up with, a series of strange things happen. In \"Ghost Bride\", Ah Hui (Henry Thia) who is unlucky in love meets a stranger, Ah Hai (Mark Lee), who promises him fortune and blessings if he seeks help from 'brothers and sisters' in the netherworld. Ah Hui does so and ends up finding a beautiful jade bangle inside a red packet. Soon after, Ah Hui strikes the lottery, but spends it all lavishly. Just when he is down in the dumps again, Ah Hai offers him another solution and something strange happens.","popularity":0.413,"poster_path":"/cLrQXWPY93m40McCgIPKUShkUCP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2011-01-06","revenue":1450000,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ghosts Must Be Crazy","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":570524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Cheng","original_name":"John Cheng","popularity":0.0852,"profile_path":"/9ca0G3ONL4PP6ZJq7J6GFafiTug.jpg","cast_id":1004,"character":"Ah Nan (Reservist)","credit_id":"52fe48b2c3a368484e10620b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":570525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wang Lei","original_name":"Wang Lei","popularity":0.5992,"profile_path":"/m8ECr0646x1pfmRuIFgDRNz6kXP.jpg","cast_id":1006,"character":"Ah Lei (Reservist)","credit_id":"52fe48b2c3a368484e106213","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1817063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Bala","original_name":"David Bala","popularity":0.0966,"profile_path":"/9YhFaTNuy4iZLlrYIbK6tTgSiiy.jpg","cast_id":1008,"character":"Encik Muthu","credit_id":"591970fa92514157230571a2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Chew","original_name":"Dennis Chew","popularity":0.0849,"profile_path":"/1BeqD1bpCagGL5zNDKbPvTMpuU4.jpg","cast_id":1009,"character":"Ah Tan (Reservist)","credit_id":"59197e98c3a36842c1058962","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":570506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Thia","original_name":"Henry Thia","popularity":0.1003,"profile_path":"/xtHCo2OeRuWRa63ff0svZI5GNRU.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"Ah Hui","credit_id":"52fe48b2c3a368484e106207","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":570522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Lee","original_name":"Mark Lee","popularity":0.3712,"profile_path":"/9HlO3yUCaW4wClB6245MAamjc4D.jpg","cast_id":1005,"character":"Ah Hai","credit_id":"52fe48b2c3a368484e10620f","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":570522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Lee","original_name":"Mark Lee","popularity":0.3712,"profile_path":"/9HlO3yUCaW4wClB6245MAamjc4D.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48b2c3a368484e1061ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":570520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boris Boo","original_name":"Boris Boo","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48b2c3a368484e1061f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225055,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Neo","original_name":"Jack Neo","popularity":0.2727,"profile_path":"/39ynOQRISBlEl9A4uDHw6FodrV0.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48b2c3a368484e106219","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6423546","wikidata_id":"Q7736339","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aSs1ZSvJMfOhWXQAWzoCbxYRqoR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1420,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cLrQXWPY93m40McCgIPKUShkUCP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"鬼也笑 THE GHOSTS MUST BE CRAZY REGULAR TRAILER JACK NEO 梁智强","key":"Q-RvZhs9JqM","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2010-11-19T09:57:28.000Z","id":"5f3e916696670e00372a0dbe"}]}}}
