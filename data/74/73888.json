More than 1,000 of them are war criminals convicted at the 1946–48 Tokyo tribunal, including 14 Class-A war criminals, Hideki Tōjō among them. The film shows not only the widely reported political incidents associated with the shrine, but also takes an in-depth look at the shrine's sword-making tradition, the Yasukuni sword being the film's underlying motif.","popularity":0.0713,"poster_path":"/oFPDW17YI9zRj60tYkH1PsU9Qse.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123664,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beijing Youth Film Studio","origin_country":""},{"id":96981,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dragon Films","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2008-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yasukuni","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":474211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naoharu Kariya","original_name":"Naoharu Kariya","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe48b0c3a368484e105dcb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2265561,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Junichiro Koizumi","original_name":"小泉純一郎","popularity":0.1779,"profile_path":"/ub1VSxwJTVqsWwNKSGyuDOWE6os.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5c8b2b73c3a368644f0ef776","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":265149,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Li Ying","original_name":"Li Ying","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48b0c3a368484e105dc1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":265149,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Li Ying","original_name":"Li Ying","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48b0c3a368484e105dc7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1973109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takahiro Nakamura","original_name":"Takahiro Nakamura","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bbef74ec3a3682b3400ca8c","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1073548","wikidata_id":"Q850790","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vMSZTAzHntb21kHkR6c6H33fDXR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/oFPDW17YI9zRj60tYkH1PsU9Qse.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
