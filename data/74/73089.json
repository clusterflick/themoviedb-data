They battle their way through a series of events that combine physical challenges with high-speed beer chugging. For the past 4 years, this dedicated group has competed relentlessly to bask in the glory of winning the coveted title of Outdoorsmen Champion. As we examine the lives and friendships of the \"Veteran\" and \"Newbie\" Outdoorsmen, we discover a tradition of male bonding and whole-hearted dedication to a competition that pushes its players through events like DEATH RACE 3000, THE HATCHET TOSS, and BLIND MAN'S BEER.","popularity":0.0479,"poster_path":"/dRHX2wEsNoxPaEl45aj52TqryPu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's about nuttin' up!","title":"The Outdoorsmen: Blood, Sweat & Beers","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1362815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Yarovesky","original_name":"David Yarovesky","popularity":0.4167,"profile_path":"/44w2SUhfY7aPtZgv8cVvdo1ptiJ.jpg","credit_id":"66b187eb2762e38fe59e614b","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1325761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Allen Perry","original_name":"Scott Allen Perry","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/friRQbpc76HHqTFQqzYNio3FsXP.jpg","credit_id":"66b1880620a237a7e5a12f41","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1325761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Allen Perry","original_name":"Scott Allen Perry","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/friRQbpc76HHqTFQqzYNio3FsXP.jpg","credit_id":"66b1881a6f0784c33a91287b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4869380,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dan White","original_name":"Dan White","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b18837e5ff069407358dee","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0455670","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dRHX2wEsNoxPaEl45aj52TqryPu.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
