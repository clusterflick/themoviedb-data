The ex-soccer player now coaches the youth team of a suburban club. His sayings are just as feared as his unconventional ideas in labor disputes. Hannes lives on a houseboat that he restored himself and has a well-balanced relationship with his likeable long-term fiancé Isolde. His pride and joy is his pretty and clever daughter Annika, whom he raised alone. He would do anything for her. He even slips into an uncomfortable suit and tie and has himself chauffeured to Hamburg-Blankenese. In the small family circle, Hannes is supposed to get to know his future son-in-law, the young chef Alexander. Annika is amazed when she is received with her father in a grand villa.","popularity":0.3826,"poster_path":"/nF8nRUHykdkKR8018Syn9vYFbys.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2009-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meine Tochter und der Millionär","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan Fedder","original_name":"Jan Fedder","popularity":0.3652,"profile_path":"/l6YLu5FxF0wb7wVz6AmzN47F5vN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Hannes Schmitz","credit_id":"52fe4892c3a368484e0ffd5d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anja Knauer","original_name":"Anja Knauer","popularity":0.7475,"profile_path":"/ek3EcNvDUmXczlIB2CD3NyfnOz4.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Annika Schmitz","credit_id":"5340325fc3a36815270001f3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":233682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mareike Carrière","original_name":"Mareike Carrière","popularity":0.098,"profile_path":"/cqSXma9X1VJ3A9cNsrCT1rNTQqT.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Verena von Wrede","credit_id":"535ad1b90e0a264fdb000556","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ulrich Noethen","original_name":"Ulrich Noethen","popularity":0.2812,"profile_path":"/wetpWDhR88VBNXq1vjq6JT8N4O1.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Moritz von Wrede","credit_id":"535ad1c60e0a264fe1000570","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":233985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ulrike Grote","original_name":"Ulrike Grote","popularity":0.0605,"profile_path":"/sGUHurjOeUSGhYas6EbK9iQUTtD.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Isolde","credit_id":"54a731709251414d60000250","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1022690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristian Bader","original_name":"Kristian Bader","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Innensenator Raimund Görden","credit_id":"55c12eba9251410d7b002d49","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Güldenberg","original_name":"Patrick Güldenberg","popularity":0.1108,"profile_path":"/zdhlff9fgQghitehXFARz3EVqVK.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Alexander von Wrede","credit_id":"569ff6629251415e6700aaf6","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":45734,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christina Große","original_name":"Christina Große","popularity":0.4381,"profile_path":"/fG4JnnB6z9S1KGVugJQpClionkm.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Trude Sawatzki","credit_id":"569ff67092514149bc003132","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henning Peker","original_name":"Henning Peker","popularity":0.236,"profile_path":"/vAtZTarZEr2q4mkDdaNBsYpsZTA.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Sigi Blaschke","credit_id":"58b4336692514177b8017b27","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":221489,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephan Meyer","original_name":"Stephan Meyer","popularity":0.1175,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4892c3a368484e0ffd67","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4414037,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Rautgundis Beutel","original_name":"Rautgundis Beutel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6589f01f2dffd85b40465b00","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1327056,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Annemarie Bremer","original_name":"Annemarie Bremer","popularity":0.1102,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6589f0264da3d4644a4245ca","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38603,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hans Grimmelmann","original_name":"Hans Grimmelmann","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6589f030688cd057eb856cf7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1277948","wikidata_id":"Q1918025","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nF8nRUHykdkKR8018Syn9vYFbys.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-05-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
