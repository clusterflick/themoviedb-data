The veteran tight end is a fan favorite and on pace to set the all-time receiving yards record that will guarantee a spot in the Hall of Fame. While working out at training camp, Jake receives an call from that his father Frank has suffered a major heart attack. Jake immediately leaves practice and returns home to a small town heâ€™s avoided for 15 years. Memories of glory and regret flood his mind as he returns to family and friends he once abandoned in pursuit of his career. Jake dutifully visits his father, but hurt and misunderstanding from the past begin to resurface. A second unexpected call, this time from his agent, delivers Jake another crushing blow. His contract is not being renewed amid concerns about his surgically repaired knee. Suddenly, the life Jake knows is over.","popularity":1.0484,"poster_path":"/kdIKGOGgoHaTvRSdmc41RuseJlB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"When winning is everything, what's left?","title":"Game Time: Tackling the Past","video":false,"vote_average":2.8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Game Time- Tackling the Past","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan McPartlin","original_name":"Ryan McPartlin","popularity":0.6511,"profile_path":"/v0vKYfoSVLBEGBZ2ldjm3cHJwf3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jake Walker","credit_id":"52fe48b4c3a368484e1068a3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2222,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beau Bridges","original_name":"Beau Bridges","popularity":2.0457,"profile_path":"/Aiezvt0Uj2Ka9QVW3GvuRLkNS2V.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Frank Walker","credit_id":"52fe48b4c3a368484e1068a7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":40588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katie Carr","original_name":"Katie Carr","popularity":0.2218,"profile_path":"/fvL1y9DIyxfLCPZ3mzHJ4vYpkdn.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sarah","credit_id":"52fe48b4c3a368484e1068ab","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Hicks","original_name":"Catherine Hicks","popularity":0.7429,"profile_path":"/eGgCeUbtsq69nCPG1w7vU7DzJpO.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Anna Walker","credit_id":"52fe48b4c3a368484e1068af","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":206928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maxwell Perry Cotton","original_name":"Maxwell Perry Cotton","popularity":0.2399,"profile_path":"/mk4x51e1a1vTF3KiOt8AtnN7jRh.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Micah","credit_id":"52fe48b4c3a368484e1068b3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":915692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Varga","original_name":"Lisa Varga","popularity":0.2536,"profile_path":"/wu5kNf7IC8TQapOvM3stIeHKnjb.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Karen Walker","credit_id":"52fe48b4c3a368484e1068b7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1046348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maggie Elizabeth Jones","original_name":"Maggie Elizabeth Jones","popularity":0.5598,"profile_path":"/uW5b3YCczuDiD7ROAeQZKBojdvN.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Shayla Walker","credit_id":"52fe48b4c3a368484e1068bb","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1213302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Braaten","original_name":"Josh Braaten","popularity":0.2692,"profile_path":"/6DjSpg01t0j3hyG9wEvYClAIdFa.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Dean Walker","credit_id":"52fe48b4c3a368484e1068bf","order":7}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2011024","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kdIKGOGgoHaTvRSdmc41RuseJlB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":802}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":579,"name":"american football"},{"id":12279,"name":"family drama"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
