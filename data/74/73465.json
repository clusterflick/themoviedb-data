From the discovery of his sexual identity to his first love, from his military service to his move to the big city, his personal experience traces the history of Spain, from Franco's dictatorship to the achievement of democracy. A baroque melodrama where the protagonist's homosexuality and religious belief together form a single devotion, passionate and unwavering.","popularity":0.1927,"poster_path":"/bGxvP1vbBBSuE2f5LUYxCL0yjeE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7690,"logo_path":null,"name":"Artimagen","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2009-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Madre
