Escorted by Arturo, Marta's husband, Kevin paid monthly visits to his mother in the guerrilla camp until the AUC (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia) a paramilitary group, took hold of the region. The AUC murders Marta and destroys the village, forcing Kevin's displacement to the nearby city of Bucaramanga, to stay with Fabiola, Marta's sister. There, Kevin refuses to accept his new conditions, leaves school, and plots to go back and find his parents. But Fabiola's sudden illness will force him to choose between chasing ghosts or embracing his newfound family.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blanket of Words","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
