Unfortunately, Abraham's son Sonny has not inherited his father's decent, hardworking instincts so when his mistress, Mrs. Morgan, needs money Sammy robs Abraham's safe and then disappears. Time passes, and oil is discovered on a tract of land left to Abraham by his late wife. Although he can now afford to live comfortably with his adopted daughter Mary, Abraham still strongly feels the loss of his son. His life is finally made complete when Sammy returns repentant to marry Abraham's housekeeper Sarah, and the old peddler, his struggles now over, can spend the rest of his days surrounded by his family.","popularity":0.0844,"poster_path":"/b3mlSTWRbcsVgCu3huw2TIeHMqs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99729,"logo_path":null,"name":"U.S. Amusement Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Peddler","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1385261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sidney Mason","original_name":"Sidney Mason","popularity":0.0847,"profile_path":"/vLSaJoBcEdrJGqAZkd58iMP9BQx.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sammy","credit_id":"671a2e3d6e4210780f78c294","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2363451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Calvert","original_name":"Catherine Calvert","popularity":0.0522,"profile_path":"/l9ysWQSa9begNOISuGXxfCLH8ok.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sarah","credit_id":"671a2e466e4210780f78c299","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1285046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kittens Reichert","original_name":"Kittens Reichert","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/78amDSpvQdFPWS2MMVYHjQKkCwp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mary","credit_id":"671a2e529ff681d9e0a3d0ac","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1142898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sally Crute","original_name":"Sally Crute","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/j4EAUflh93T6hlZV0eSvTS2XFtx.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mrs. Morgan","credit_id":"671a2e5de833d92ef05fda94","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5018953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Welch","original_name":"Joe Welch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Abraham Jacobs","credit_id":"671a2e339ff681d9e0a3d097","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144044,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Herbert Blaché","original_name":"Herbert Blaché","popularity":0.1033,"profile_path":"/kMzBOVmNGzn4Lx1xhB39KGAVQTh.jpg","credit_id":"671a2e689ff681d9e0a3d0b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1466148,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frederick Chapin","original_name":"Frederick Chapin","popularity":0.048,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671a2e74fefd1e0510ffe6d6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1797360,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John G.
