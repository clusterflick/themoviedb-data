And he obsessively tries to capture it with his phone camera. Other experts—filmmakers from different countries, art historians, a scenographer in charge of a natural science museum, and members of the human species from a distant future—think about ways of representating nature. A kaleidoscopic, playful collage, sometimes fiction, sometimes documentary, the film cannot help but wonder about the nature of cinema itself.","popularity":0.0708,"poster_path":"/nsMxf6i8fO5DOdOlbocVDyq9UrQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Instead of Trees","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1169134,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philipp Hartmann","original_name":"Philipp Hartmann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6719f37f5be9e8759da6e2db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1169134,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philipp Hartmann","original_name":"Philipp Hartmann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6719f3965be9e8759da6e2e8","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":1078,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mAS2dPvFlCpxvkpsqhuuDlOamZd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":799,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nsMxf6i8fO5DOdOlbocVDyq9UrQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":565}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
