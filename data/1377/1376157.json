When asked, the father reacts by telling Rüdolph that he will give his daughter only to an officer. In the next indoor scene his daughter is sick, and Cupid comes along and whispers something in the father’s ear that makes him very happy. In the final scene of the fragment we see the father in a room, sleeping on a chair next to a baby when Cupid enters. The ending is missing. The setting and clothes are in the 18th-century French aristocratic style.– Elif Rongen-Kaynakçi","popularity":0.0807,"poster_path":"/2iJm4Z9GKqeRVAGsQjneEanfxw1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9,"logo_path":"/nda3dTUYdDrJ6rZqBpYvY865aDv.png","name":"Gaumont","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1910-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L’amour vainqueur","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Luguet","original_name":"André Luguet","popularity":0.179,"profile_path":"/xH9Qv3BCQ2VOXbkl5RA7aEhvtBb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6719e6af27bd57d91f624c35","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5119880","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2iJm4Z9GKqeRVAGsQjneEanfxw1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1910-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
