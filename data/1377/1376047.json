From the window, you can see they are in Vienna’s Alterlaa housing project, a satellite city. Life feels opaque next to the strange beauty of the concrete walls and the green terraces; it is sufocating to live in pre-designed happiness. An elderly woman drags herself through the complex, trying to leave her life behind. In a place that houses 9000 people, you can find absolutely everything. That’s the fun of it but also the misery.","popularity":0.4454,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":69284,"logo_path":"/bJvXyW1dGcGJMb4F1qxaKKLc5JP.png","name":"Nabis Filmgroup","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2024-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ruletista","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":238260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margarethe Tiesel","original_name":"Margarethe Tiesel","popularity":0.2687,"profile_path":"/vyZ9qH5HFot8EcpzClc7S0G2qOT.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"671983a3e833d92ef05fc8b0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1411886,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lukas Valenta Rinner","original_name":"Lukas Valenta Rinner","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671983b8427c5c19f025b17f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3925040,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yael Svoboda","original_name":"Yael Svoboda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671983d4427c5c19f025b189","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1411886,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lukas Valenta Rinner","original_name":"Lukas Valenta Rinner","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671983e6e833d92ef05fc8d2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1622583,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Javier Favot","original_name":"Javier Favot","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67198417e833d92ef05fc8f7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3925040,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yael Svoboda","original_name":"Yael Svoboda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67198425c7802cc50359b607","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1639042,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Serafin Spitzer","original_name":"Serafin Spitzer","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67198442427c5c19f025b1d8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Viennale","release_date":"2024-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
