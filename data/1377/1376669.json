Hot on the heels of last year’s Oscar-winning film Oppenheimer, this timely investigation of Canada’s complicity traces the connection from Gilbert LaBine’s 1930 discovery of a rare radium deposit in the Northwest Territories to today’s ongoing 2.6 billion dollar nuclear waste clean-up project in Port Hope, Ontario. Atomic Reaction features fascinating expert interviews, first hand testimonies, and generational accounts to present a nuanced and thought-provoking examination of how these hidden histories have impacted the Indigenous Dene people of the Northwest Territories, Port Hope residents, and other communities worldwide.","popularity":0.0828,"poster_path":"/k9ddwLKBAQzxp30hrvM4kJ4OiOW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Canada’s significant role in the Manhattan Project and the fallout seventy-five years later.","title":"Atomic Reaction","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":230201,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michèle Hozer","original_name":"Michèle Hozer","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671b0a1227bd57d91f6282d6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5020502,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Hatch","original_name":"David Hatch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671b0a84fefd1e05100009db","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2585539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernie Finkelstein","original_name":"Bernie Finkelstein","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671b0a94b3d5cbb842f3fc76","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5020504,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Hatch","original_name":"David Hatch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671b0aa99ff681d9e0a3ef73","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k9ddwLKBAQzxp30hrvM4kJ4OiOW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1382}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"DRIFF Premiere","release_date":"2024-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"CBC Documentary Channel Premiere","release_date":"2024-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
