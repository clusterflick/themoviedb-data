The color temperature of different light sources is ­measured in Kelvin. 6500 Kelvin corresponds to the value of overcast daylight and is used as a standard for the neutral registration of white surfaces. 6500 is an essay film on the relativity of words, ­questioning the application of absolute values in an argument, visualized through a play on colors, their spaces, and their highly subjective perception. Quotes from Ludwig Wittgenstein’s “Remarks on Colour” ­emphasize this rhythmic flickering and slightly absurd ­conversation between colour and language.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/jkwl5WmYJgoQiOU96M8gnDU0c67.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"6500","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1951056,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa Truttmann","original_name":"Lisa Truttmann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/75cY8kY0ykZke1CxAjEgWSAZvSW.jpg","credit_id":"6719d2bd5be9e8759da6de12","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1658,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jkwl5WmYJgoQiOU96M8gnDU0c67.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1105}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
