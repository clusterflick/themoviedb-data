She discovers too late that Blake already has a wife but makes the best of the situation until Mason's death, just after he has made a lucky gambling coup, leaves her a little money. Determined to escape, she goes to a small town where minister Daniel Clarkson becomes interested in her. Because James Lawton had sought marriage between Clarkson and his daughter, when Blake turns up, and Lawton learns the story, he denounces Ruth to the minister. When Clarkson learns the truth, he forgives Ruth and, knowing that he will lose his position, he enlists, promising to return and marry her when the war is over.","popularity":0.1232,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":242742,"logo_path":null,"name":"Frank A.
