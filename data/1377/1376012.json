Filmed with a camera in a waterproof housing strapped to Greenough√≠s back, the sequence is composed entirely of slow-motion footage shot inside the curl of waves, edited to the 23-minute song \"Echoes\" by Pink Floyd. The group reportedly allowed Elfick and Greenough to use the music in their film in exchange for the use of Greenough's footage as a visual background when they performed \"Echoes\" in concert.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/9ka8ndNDU243jFVAtz6pOFSxvqA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pink Floyd: Echoes The Crystal Voyager","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sMNNyvMizqXpsx3gFOwWJnLnvrB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9ka8ndNDU243jFVAtz6pOFSxvqA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
