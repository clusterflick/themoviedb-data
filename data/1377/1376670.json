They often graduated from prestigious foreign film schools, or just exploded on the scene, a big change from the slow and gradual rise to the top of the past. More importantly, their way of knocking at the door was often short films. Wild, wacky, genial, brilliant short films. This second edition of Korean Academy of Film Arts - My Beautiful Short Stories not only features short films from acclaimed directors, such as Bong Joon Ho, Lee Young Jae, and Lee Jung Hyang, but also gems from new names whom we may see a lot more of in coming years.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Korean Academy of Film Arts - My Beautiful Short Stories, Volume 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
