The film depicts the internal dialogue on coping with the grief and fear of ecological degradation, using the local streets of Berlin as a means to materialise and confront these emotions. As both the body and mind begin to wander, encounters with the landscape over a 24 hour period are transformed into an overstimulating and emotionally charged journey.  Camcorder footage, film developed in beer and cyanotype create sensational and playful depictions of the surroundings, joining the rats scurrying on the ground and fleeing the night lights with the moths. Creatures of metal and flesh interact within and between the frames, coming together as an ugly yet vibrant community.  Subverting the nature-culture dichotomy, a new image of nature is formed, not only as a romantic, distant place, but rather a dirty, omnipresent force.","popularity":0.15,"poster_path":"/cs5IhxJFL2xCU9OhMSddgZIPzWk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Yearning for intimacy with nature, the body and mind wander the streets of Berlin to discover its dirty, omnipresent force.","title":"Losing Touch","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5538018,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charlie Black","original_name":"Charlie Black","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/x7sNonOcGlx2Gw9wx2o8n0AMQXs.jpg","credit_id":"6863e3c19d379a470c2be1ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5538040,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lucas 'FleurVil' Hochar","original_name":"Lucas 'FleurVil' Hochar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6863e52aaee3e833782be150","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5538018,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charlie Black","original_name":"Charlie Black","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/x7sNonOcGlx2Gw9wx2o8n0AMQXs.jpg","credit_id":"6863e588a7b6fd81eee64a04","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eXJzb3UBXxY4UgQdJ14znFQ044.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eDsdki8figSy87GxfHVbjxexw7L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wIdPxQu1zzZTyfqbBgY6kd1hVcN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kAVO0aaabhpo9Oum3BMhGDZUZk2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":2760,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cs5IhxJFL2xCU9OhMSddgZIPzWk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":242436,"name":"urban nature"},{"id":272851,"name":"environmental documentary"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"},{"id":296071,"name":"experimental documentary"},{"id":296721,"name":"experimental animation"},{"id":297442,"name":"animation"},{"id":304618,"name":"urban landscape"},{"id":330335,"name":"analog film"},{"id":353988,"name":"analogue camera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Losing Touch / Trailer","key":"1049798309","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-01-23T19:57:29.000Z","id":"6863e126dadeb09ce0f8445a"}]}}}
