Through a journey into their lives, we discover what it means to live with this condition and begin to break down the barriers and misconceptions that have been built over more than four decades, contributing to a stigma that no longer reflects the reality of HIV today. A mother with HIV who was able to have a healthy child, a patient who has lived with the disease for over twenty years, a father who lost his son in this battle, a man who was diagnosed but has maintained a safe sexual relationship with his partner for years, and a young man born with HIV who fights every day to raise awareness about the issue.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"VIH: La causa justa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34006162","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
