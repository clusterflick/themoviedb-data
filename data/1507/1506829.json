Roger Corman, an independent artist out of the box, embodies the ideal of an autarkic and democratic art, able to combine originality and popularity. In a journey of fifty minutes, through the words of the director, the images of his most famous works and crossed testimonies, is composed the portrait of an artist unique in the world, able to discover a very young Jack Nicholson - of which you can see the thunderous look already in La piccola bottega degli errori - but also talents like Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Jonathan Demme, Ron Howard, James Cameron, Joe Dante.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/qS99QJ1GhGWl3O4BL14uDNlPkoi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":266768,"logo_path":null,"name":"01 distribution","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il mago del cinema - L'incredibile storia di Mr. Corman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":592716,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Luigi Sardiello","original_name":"Luigi Sardiello","popularity":0.0608,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686405d1d76e6c42421f8078","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2697683,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nico Guidetti","original_name":"Nico Guidetti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686405f22e3ae012378c23f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2759724","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/qS99QJ1GhGWl3O4BL14uDNlPkoi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
