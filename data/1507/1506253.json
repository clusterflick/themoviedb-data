Often labeled as self-hating, they reflect on intergenerational trauma, faith, family rupture, and political awakening. Their message is clear: to oppose injustice in our name is not self-hatred — it’s self-love.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Self-Loving Jew","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5536097,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sterre Volders","original_name":"Sterre Volders","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6862861463ca70f67a4d231e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
