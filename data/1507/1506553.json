The bout marked Zárate's third U.S. appearance after knockouts of James Martinez and Joe Guevara. Amores, though stopped in three of four losses, carried legitimate knockout power with 23 KOs, including wins over quality opponents like Alberto Herrera. The matchup pitted Zárate's methodical body attack against Amores' aggressive volume punching. Promoters saw this as Zárate's final test before world title contention, while Amores aimed to derail the Mexican phenom's rise. The Forum crowd anticipated whether Amores could withstand Zárate's devastating power or become his 33rd knockout victim.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orlando Amores vs. Carlos Zarate","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
