It tells of people who stay in a country at war to be there for animals. With all the hurdles that have become their normality.  And it tells of dreamers from Germany who are confronted with the bitter reality of a privileged situation. People with two left hands who admittedly have more heart and soul than manual skills.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Animal Bridge - Every soul needs a home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5536351,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malte Zierden","original_name":"Malte Zierden","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6862afe18481ff3aa50d97d1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5536353,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phia Quantius","original_name":"Phia Quantius","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6862aff6295fd4150c915ee8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5536354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Broder Böll","original_name":"Broder Böll","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6862b004b75319a1064d23b3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5536355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hubertus Zeck","original_name":"Hubertus Zeck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6862b010b24921d8238e0ff8","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5536351,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malte Zierden","original_name":"Malte Zierden","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6863b20c0826f61b6df83ec5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5536353,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phia Quantius","original_name":"Phia Quantius","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6863b2291c819cb834ccd9c6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2gNUrKxLnrJ7HR4LY9FI5pbi8TQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/8jhmZmsF58TMi2VHpfayZIcR0Ru.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2025-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
