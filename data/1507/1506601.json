A roller skating coach from San Pablo de Yao, a small town in the Sierra Maestra, Cuba, leaves his house in his daily routine, crosses the river, and teaches skating classes. He returns home, carrying all the love of the city of San Pablo de Yao. However, his work is fraught with conflicts that mark his work and the children's education. The streets of San Pablo de Yao allow this sport to exist in the city, but the river poses a threat during periods of constant rain, causing training to be suspended for several days, either because it prevents Chepe from crossing the river and reaching the town, or because the streets are wet.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/aZtI4q8304FblTVO1LtSexpGkQI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":266729,"logo_path":null,"name":"Televisión Serrana","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What entertains children and allows them to dream in a small Cuban town?","title":"Deseo Y Esperanza","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Desire and Hope","type":"English"},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Desejo e Esperança","type":"Portuguese"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
