Guided by an adult, a symbol of the generations that preserve this centuries-old tradition, the child enters a world of memories, knowledge and traditions that resist the test of time.  Between workshops and shipyards, conversations with master builders and walks along the waters of the estuary, the story unfolds like a bridge between generations. This docufiction interweaves reality and fiction, testimonies and dramatization, showing how cultural heritage is transmitted, not only through words, but through lived experiences.  More than telling the story of the Vougas, this film celebrates those who keep them alive, and those who will one day carry them forward.”","popularity":0.2143,"poster_path":"/vwSASoteWgBCyE3cFK2AvwdUq2k.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":266754,"logo_path":null,"name":"Classe Vouga","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2025-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A docufiction about heritage, memory, and the future.","title":"Vougas of the Ria de Aveiro","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5538007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mário Ribeiro","original_name":"Mário Ribeiro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Mário","credit_id":"6863de35a8ab8bdbeb4d0d05","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5538008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucas Loura","original_name":"Lucas Loura","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Lucas","credit_id":"6863de44aecded363fbb3a35","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5538010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Delmar Conde","original_name":"Delmar Conde","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Delmar Conde","credit_id":"6863de605b14001df2495623","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5538011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"João Vilarinho","original_name":"João Vilarinho","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"João Vilarinho","credit_id":"6863de7327c04db8f3f83ec4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5538012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hélder Ventura","original_name":"Hélder Ventura","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Hélder Ventura","credit_id":"6863de8d9b677a4572bb3a3d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4520532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomás Viola","original_name":"Tomás Viola","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/dGJP1OUHhKXgwZdxFfORYgWsSez.jpg","credit_id":"6863dc6a8dbe867835d123e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4520555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claudia Neto","original_name":"Claudia Neto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6863dc7bc4d2c380b4ccdb4d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5538002,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pedro Luzia","original_name":"Pedro Luzia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6863dc92a3a0665fe22be18a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5538004,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mário Costa","original_name":"Mário Costa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6863dca9e23b86f33b4d0caa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/faXUgwuyy2sZt5mwo2q6TMWowze.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wxSBxiZcG9SAuLsDvsy6uY9UGhE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lERn45dQro2JkyhTiIpmrhN3zVa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":0.725,"height":1644,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kzZg7RItHp0U2wJ1mNdkDPNU1aW.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1192}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1398,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vwSASoteWgBCyE3cFK2AvwdUq2k.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":932}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":324,"name":"portugal"},{"id":1422,"name":"boat"},{"id":267537,"name":"mixed media"},{"id":283800,"name":"docufiction"},{"id":325824,"name":"hopeful"},{"id":349668,"name":"vela"},{"id":354558,"name":"classe vouga"},{"id":354559,"name":"aveiro"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"M/3","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2025-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Os Vougas da Ria de Aveiro","key":"DLIEWd-VtfE","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2025-07-01T13:18:42.000Z","id":"6863e07cae1974c5611f7fc5"}]}}}
