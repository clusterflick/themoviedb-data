The stakes were higher this time, with the vacant IBF junior middleweight title also on the line after Natasha Jonas vacated the belt.  Spencer, a decorated Canadian amateur, overhauled her training camp post-loss, hiring coach Samuel Décarie-Drolet to address technical gaps exposed in their first fight. Hermans, a former WBO champion, entered with momentum from two 2023 stoppage wins and confidence from her prior victory.  Promoters framed it as a grudge match, with Spencer vowing to \"lead the dance\" in Hell’s territory—a nod to Hermans’ punishing style in their initial bout. The event, streamed on ESPN+, featured a stacked Eye of the Tiger card, including Erik Bazinyan’s co-main title defense.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Femke Hermans vs. Mary Spencer II","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
