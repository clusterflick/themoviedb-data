The abode is a flattened cylinder with rubber walls fifty meters in circumference and eighteen meters high. It is constantly illuminated by a dim, yellow light, and the temperature fluctuates between 5°C to 25°C, sometimes in as small an interval as four seconds. This leads to extremely parched skin, and the bodies brush against each other like dry leaves. Kisses make an \"indescribable sound\" and the rubber makes the footsteps mostly silent.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/8LGgjrpMmTaGjANTq3udvW6MT4g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lost Ones","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Warrilow","original_name":"David Warrilow","popularity":0.1031,"profile_path":"/w6APS9AwQk3WlNLMJ1En0fdYjDL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6862cf1aa4aaebefde892a67","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":119227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellen McElduff","original_name":"Ellen McElduff","popularity":0.2231,"profile_path":"/svjRKa7gWBkM3FQ4Qsc6YyS0iBx.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6862cf831febe8bd9ce5c03c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5536604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Wolfe","original_name":"Linda Wolfe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6862cfa4a2475e17d07ffffd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5536606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Raymond","original_name":"Bill Raymond","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6862cfb34c89c819d0988d5f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5536609,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Breuer","original_name":"Lee Breuer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6862cfe31a8868984a2ec8d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5536609,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Breuer","original_name":"Lee Breuer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6862cff1e45069de8a892a6c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148609,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Samuel Beckett","original_name":"Samuel Beckett","popularity":0.2183,"profile_path":"/e1SlVssYS2O6Xq35u89ZKHPKEgt.jpg","credit_id":"6862d0055619ce2f0f15ae5e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1551,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Philip Glass","original_name":"Philip Glass","popularity":0.233,"profile_path":"/dsf8ajHq4BJeTHdrwcM9OW72x4R.jpg","credit_id":"6862d053009e89a3937f1f00","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8742804","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8LGgjrpMmTaGjANTq3udvW6MT4g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
