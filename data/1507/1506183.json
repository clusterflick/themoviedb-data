Through poetic verses and rhythmic rap, the lyrics express deep admiration for a lover’s beauty, comparing it to the radiance of the moon and the melody of music. The singer confesses that words cannot define their emotions—every glance, smile, and moment shared makes their heart race. The chorus passionately declares that life feels meaningless without their beloved, as no other love exists in this world for them. The bridge reflects on the darkness of separation and the light their lover brings, while the outro fades with a tender vow to cherish them forever. A heartfelt ode to love’s enchanting power.
