With the gritty rhythm of the Northeast and the polish of a comedy veteran, Vecchione unloads a barrage of fast-paced, observational humor that hits on everything from aging and generational divides to the absurdity of modern life.  Navigating the world with sarcastic precision and deadpan charm, Vecchione doesn’t pull punches—but he doesn’t play favorites either. No one is safe, including himself. It’s clean comedy with an edge, and a masterclass in making the mundane feel hilariously high-stakes.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/a3WkZynxYnZ5Ac3L0cNnCkjplhT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mike Vecchione: Low Income White","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2081963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Vecchione","original_name":"Mike Vecchione","popularity":0.1476,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68628a580dda9a12df9160f7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1337794,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nate Bargatze","original_name":"Nate Bargatze","popularity":0.3211,"profile_path":"/60KdELrwXRuNAKJveTaZIpHyDUU.jpg","credit_id":"68628a774f4da68690a4da55","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3499075,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Lavin","original_name":"Mike Lavin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/cuLGgIahUZZzOC9OpHmDfJ2lWax.jpg","credit_id":"68628a842bcbb0006c3042d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a3WkZynxYnZ5Ac3L0cNnCkjplhT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9716,"name":"stand-up comedy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
