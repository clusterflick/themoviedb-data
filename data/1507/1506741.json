After all, nothing anyone does ever seem to make any difference. With the quick deterioration of freedom in Hong Kong, how much longer can the old man choose to stay silent before the oppression becomes too much? Amidst the noises from all sides, which side should we listen to, or should we simply stay apathetic and block out the noise altogether?","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/bHbBLd2vuGHk16n90gyZ3DMGtYO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2011-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paradox","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2601931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricky Yeung","original_name":"Ricky Yeung","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6863e563b746ffb2a88c24df","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2007875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lo Chun-Yip","original_name":"盧鎮業","popularity":0.3508,"profile_path":"/jJr20Wd096NRnUjLmaxdLeZgSKt.jpg","credit_id":"6863cea53869b0a85d2be21b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2007875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lo Chun-Yip","original_name":"盧鎮業","popularity":0.3508,"profile_path":"/jJr20Wd096NRnUjLmaxdLeZgSKt.jpg","credit_id":"6863cebc2d8d9cb03d4955b4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2007875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lo Chun-Yip","original_name":"盧鎮業","popularity":0.3508,"profile_path":"/jJr20Wd096NRnUjLmaxdLeZgSKt.jpg","credit_id":"6863ceca4e9420cda54d0cfd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2531338,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rick Lau Tsz-Kin","original_name":"Rick Lau Tsz-Kin","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6863cefc7d607284cdd12347","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5532691,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivia Chan Hei Yu","original_name":"Olivia Chan Hei Yu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6863e791c60ae42bcfe64a19","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":814,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eb25FFIXdXWmmOh2iMOkaEAnzJC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1448}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":856,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bHbBLd2vuGHk16n90gyZ3DMGtYO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":570}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"6th Fresh Wave International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2011-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Freshwave 2011 鮮浪潮--本地競賽短片 淹沒 trailer","key":"SMHvWCDrR-Y","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2011-08-26T13:34:19.000Z","id":"6863cf26d78ee72881495587"}]}}}
