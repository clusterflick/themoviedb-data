The fight was Zárate's final tune-up before his WBC title shot against Rodolfo Martínez. Zárate had only gone past 4 rounds five times in his career, including twice since his 1974 decision over Víctor Ramírez (7 rounds vs Martinez, 8 vs Torres). Deciga was a durable test - stopped just twice before round 5. Zárate's team wanted rounds to prove his stamina for championship fights. While on a 14-fight KO streak, Zárate needed to show he could dominate late. Deciga's toughness made him ideal preparation for Martínez. The Monterrey crowd awaited to see if Zárate could handle extended action before his title challenge.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cesar Deciga vs. Carlos Zarate","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-03-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
