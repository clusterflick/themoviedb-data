Zárate, then 23 and sporting a 30-0 record (29 KOs), faced Martinez—an unbeaten Texan prospect (19-0-1)—on the undercard of Ruben Olivares vs. Alexis Arguello at the Forum in Inglewood. Promoters positioned the bout as Zárate’s U.S. debut, testing his vaunted power against Martinez’s gritty resilience. Though Martinez lacked name recognition, his undefeated record and regional reputation (including wins over fighters like Johnny Moreno) made him a legitimate hurdle. Zárate’s team saw the fight as a chance to prove his dominance extended beyond Mexico, while Martinez aimed to derail the rising phenom’s momentum.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"James Martinez vs. Carlos Zarate","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
