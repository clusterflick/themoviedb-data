Torres, brother of flyweight champion Efren Torres, brought experience but was outmatched by Zárate’s relentless power. The bout followed Zárate’s dominant U.S. performances against James Martinez and Joe Guevara, and preceded his WBC title eliminator against Nestor Jiménez two months later.  Torres, though tough, was seen as a tactical step for Zárate to refine his technique before world title contention. Zárate’s trainer, Arturo \"Cuyo\" Hernández, emphasized disciplined aggression, aiming to prove his pupil was more than just a brawler. The fight was part of Zárate’s systematic dismantling of regional contenders, showcasing his precision and body-shot mastery en route to his 1976 title shot against Rodolfo Martínez.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jorge Torres vs. Carlos Zarate","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
