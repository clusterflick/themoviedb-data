The matchup pitted Zárate's devastating power against Martínez's championship experience, with both Mexican fighters known for knockouts.  Zárate entered riding a 16-fight KO streak, having dominated contenders like James Martinez and Joe Guevara. Martínez had made three title defenses since dethroning Rafael Herrera in 1974, including tough battles against Venice Borkhorsor and Alberto Sandoval.
