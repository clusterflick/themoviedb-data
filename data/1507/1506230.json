Her work is described as magical realism. She has created an imaginary planet called Namseki.  Ani grew up in Yerevan and lived there until she was accepted to teach english in a borderline village school at Choratan, 6 kilometres away from the Azerbeijani border in a high risk conflict zone.  This documentary concentrates on the personal transformation of Ani. Why did she decide to leave the city? What did she find here? How did her creative work change?  With Aniâ€™s transformation Namseki has transformed as well. She expands the realities of Namseki by actively recording her reality from Choratan in her diary, which she wants to, one day, print out in a form of one, thick book.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/A2DFHN1Yktk5dejbhEJGPUx5Xgt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Armenian","iso_639_1":"hy","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ani from Planet Namseki","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5536107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ani Khachatryan","original_name":"Ani Khachatryan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Key Cast","credit_id":"686289eb1572bfd78a0d9744","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5536045,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sona Khachatryan","original_name":"Sona Khachatryan","popularity":0.0929,"profile_path":"/iAZjKfejfxzYjT6dbO67r6YiNIm.jpg","credit_id":"68627aa21a96c102737b4f1f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5536045,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sona Khachatryan","original_name":"Sona Khachatryan","popularity":0.0929,"profile_path":"/iAZjKfejfxzYjT6dbO67r6YiNIm.jpg","credit_id":"686289d81d3d3d52497edde1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A2DFHN1Yktk5dejbhEJGPUx5Xgt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hy","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
