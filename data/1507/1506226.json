The rhythm of the days dictates the rhythm of the film - making a fire, looking out of the window, spending time together at the table. La Grotta documents a peculiar state of relaxed concentration on a spring day by the sea, solving crossword puzzles with friends and panning shots along the rock formations. Late Summer is a portrait of our friends Heide and Karola, who recently moved into a new apartment. From the stairwell to their rooms, light, objects and colors reveal the idiosyncrasies and experiences of two shared lives. In the fall we visited Ewelina, Nuno and Helena in Portugal, Mãozinha is an immediate and gentle expression of these days together: falling leaves in the park, small hands and large objects, the setting sun paints the clouds in different shades.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/qWsNmAe0c2ZDjifthDQjgf3R4P5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2025-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Album","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5125420,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Björn Schmitt","original_name":"Björn Schmitt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686278d5762b477c3f718aa4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5125418,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Larissa Krampert","original_name":"Larissa Krampert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686278e4085282ee007b4f26","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qWsNmAe0c2ZDjifthDQjgf3R4P5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
