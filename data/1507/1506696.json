Crisp (not to be confused with the other Quentin Crisp, author of The Naked Civil Servant) contemplates the value of living a creative life such as his.  Duckweed (根無し草) adopts the form of the literary zuihitsu, a style of Japanese literature dating back to the Heian period, where one ‘‘follows the brush’’. This feature-length film-essay is structured around readings of Crisp’s own zuihitsu of the same name, which, in essence, is the story of his life. As we follow Crisp on a walk deeper into the ‘‘little wood’’ of his private landscape, the binaries of success and failure begin to fade away.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Obscure, aging and living on the outskirts of London, writer of supernatural fiction Quentin S Crisp asks himself a fundamental existential question, ‘Who am I?
