Zárate, riding a 31-fight KO streak broken just once by decision, was systematically destroying opponents - including his crushing U.S. debut KO of James Martinez months earlier. Guevara had earned this shot through disciplined wins over tough regional fighters like Frankie Duarte, though his modest 5 KOs in 14 fights raised questions about his power. The matchup represented a classic clash: Zárate's devastating Mexican power-punching versus Guevara's technically sound, undefeated American style. Promoters positioned it as Zárate's final proving ground before world title contention, while Guevara's team saw a chance to shock boxing by handing the phenom his first loss. The bout drew particular interest as Zárate's second U.S. appearance, testing whether his dominance would translate fully stateside.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joe Guevara vs. Carlos Zarate","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
