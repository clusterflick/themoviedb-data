But at Lancasterâ€™s A-Yard, near Los Angeles, a group of young men, willing to take a chance to be mocked in the yard, start a dance class led by French choreographer Dimitri Chamblas. This class quickly becomes an intoxicating escape from their grim reality so they decide to create a dance show. In this exceptional context, the inmates engage with overwhelming sincerity, evoking their childhood, ganglife, the crimes, the prison, and their desire for transformation. Beyond damaged lives and a prison system on the edge of the abyss, DANCING IN A-YARD explores redemption and the capacity of human beings to reinvent themselves, when given a chance. And more importantly, how art and introspection can help see the light.","popularity":0.0786,"poster_path":"/ciENkCvcMHhD6ptrUJXhTYXT7Rj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dancing
