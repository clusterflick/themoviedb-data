The voices of well-known actors humorously comment on the mundane situations in the airport hall, the outdated equipment of the old airport and the unprecedented technical innovations of the new one. The modern airport ensures the best possible care not only for passengers but also for the crew and the machines themselves, which is a prerequisite for safe flight. Finally, the film returns to the four-year construction of the terminal in 1964–1968 with several archive shots.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Prague Airport","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","title":"Letiště Praha","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2615857,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rudolf Obdržálek","original_name":"Rudolf Obdržálek","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68645826d94af163c51f8162","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1968-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
