Whitaker, the reigning WBA/WBC/IBF lightweight champion (25-1), was an Olympic gold medalist and defensive mastermind fighting in his Norfolk, Virginia, hometown. Díaz, Spain's undefeated European champion (32-0), was a charismatic brawler known as \"El Potro de Vallecas\" who'd revitalized Spanish boxing. Their rivalry ignited in 1990 when Whitaker fought in Madrid, where Díaz famously taunted him from the crowd, shouting threats that electrified Spanish media. Negotiations were tense, with Díaz's team pushing for a neutral venue before conceding to Whitaker's backyard. The fight became a cultural event in Spain, with 2.5 million viewers staying up past 4 AM to watch 1. Whitaker aimed to dominate, while Díaz—who'd trained by studying Whitaker's flaws—believed he could shock the world.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Policarpo Diaz vs. Pernell Whitaker","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-07-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
