Tapia, the undefeated WBA bantamweight champion (46-0-2), was a flamboyant star known for his \"Mi Vida Loca\" persona and turbulent life outside the ring. Ayala (27-1), a disciplined but lesser-known southpaw, had failed in his only prior title shot in Japan—a fight unseen by U.S. audiences, which may have led Tapia’s team to underestimate him. The bout, held at Mandalay Bay, was initially overshadowed by a heavyweight undercard but became a clash of styles: Tapia’s slick boxing versus Ayala’s relentless pressure. Tensions flared at the weigh-in when Tapia shoved Ayala, foreshadowing an explosive encounter.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paulie Ayala vs. Johnny Tapia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
