The aim of the unlikely pair is to find - and kill - the vampires who, according to legend, live in a mysterious castle here. They find shelter in the freezing cold night in a run-down inn owned by the untrusting Chagall and his wife Rebecca. Here Alfred falls in love with the innkeeper's daughter Sarah, who is soon lured to his castle by the sinister but also extremely charismatic Count von Krolock and invited to a grand ball. As Alfred and the Professor try to rescue Sarah, they themselves end up in the castle, where they are already welcomed by the Count. Events escalate at the big midnight ball, but in the end they both manage to free Sarah - but not without a surprising twist.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/vzt01ZBy3aXouT3VlhEJDeUolef.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":173,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dance
