What's more, the long hair that her parents always loved is now gone. The image of their daughter in a floral dress hasn't really been Berry for a long time, or perhaps never was. Except that one time a year, for the sake of Mom and Dad. The family gathering becomes a nightmare, and coming out feels like holding a sword of Damocles over Berry's head, with the implication of \"always having to be different...\" hanging over them. The film takes us on a journey of identity and embodiment, constantly torn between anxiety and finding a sense of belonging within the community.\r â€”Julia Sprenger","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2024-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Berry Wilde is a film about the search for honesty with oneself.
