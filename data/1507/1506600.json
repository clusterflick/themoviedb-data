This film deliberately presents its narrative in reverse chronological order, moving counter to the original storyline. The film is accompanied by a score composed by the band Local People Rockband (a music alias of the director himself), taken from a concept album titled Countryman. The album consists of 13 + 2 tracks meant to be listened to in sequence. Once the final track ends, the film reverses itself, looping back to the beginning. Through this structure, viewers are invited to discover a moving and memorable cinematic and auditory experience.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/oxGn4UKHXhTRb2ie2QkQd1B8aOm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2020-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Like Raining at the End of April (Director's Cut)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"th","note":"","release_date":"2020-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
