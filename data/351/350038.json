One day, when she’s in Sunday school, she meets Ragna, a girl who has just moved to the same small town with her alcoholic mother and her 8 year-old brother. In Ragna, Ester sees what she has been looking for her whole life. Unaware that Ragna sees the exact same thing in Ester, and especially Ester’s father.
