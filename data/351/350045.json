She is afraid of being left alone. Although Pia has never had a boyfriend, she thinks that she needs to find a man to love in order to survive. Then Pia meets a man called Jens at the harbour. Pia embarks on a quiet and simple relationship with him, not realising that in the meantime it is her mother who is left alone.","popularity":0.1611,"poster_path":"/iQ9gKQHlOaIwDbUWe2PZG6Qq5iE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":64935,"logo_path":"/9TR3JrU9t78JJlPX837LzWRAApf.png","name":"Adomeit
