The youth of today is called early to be mature, to have the illusion that the world is small, dependent on technology and finally to an extreme competition. Faced with such a view, a large part of today's youth, is often tending to apathy, waiting without purpose, to a life without goals.  It 's a phenomenon that the world doesn't know?
