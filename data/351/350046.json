But this is no ordinary day. It is her last. When Sia in the end closes her eyes it will be for the very last time. After two strange encounters with her pet parrot and cat she herself realises that this exact day will be her last. And it is with this realisation in mind that she has her two best friends over for tea in order to ask them to aid her with her final preparations. But not all goes according to plan.","popularity":0.0745,"poster_path":"/mgxifhKgY1KzeJCzy5LMMFQ1d66.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sia","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1584486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sigrid Lippert","original_name":"Sigrid Lippert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Sia","credit_id":"56d44d029251410bd100299b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1584487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jytte Rygaard","original_name":"Jytte Rygaard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Veninde 1","credit_id":"56d44d10c3a3681e5001376c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1354188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christiane Rohde","original_name":"Christiane Rohde","popularity":0.1562,"profile_path":"/4SzpngPa8IK1SJHkPqkpK9sMppB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Veninde 2","credit_id":"56d44d2f9251413402010fe2","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1488633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annika Berg","original_name":"Annika Berg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55ac528c9251411e0600806d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4795724","wikidata_id":"Q33566764","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mgxifhKgY1KzeJCzy5LMMFQ1d66.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
