Part two and three take place in the desert of the Southwestern United States and Mexico, where I went in quest of, and found, the natural habitat of the peyote cactus. I watched this sacred plant cut and dried for the Indians of the Native American Church. I consumed peyote on numerous occasions. In later years when I red Castineda’s books on the teachings on Don Juan I realized that Mescalito was not a figment of Don Juan’s imagination, and that there is a spirit world whether we like it or not. Part four is a document of the time, and exemplifies the poetry that was in me at that time.\"","popularity":0.1886,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1958-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Triptych in Four Parts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1180192,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wallace Berman","original_name":"Wallace Berman","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5bea476b0e0a263c0204db82","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2174572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Lamantia","original_name":"Philip Lamantia","popularity":0.0343,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5bea4772c3a36876cf01d655","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael McClure","original_name":"Michael McClure","popularity":0.1184,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5bea48f10e0a263c0a04e845","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1701755,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Reed","original_name":"John Reed","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5bea47eb92514143ea04c403","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":267634,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lawrence Jordan","original_name":"Lawrence Jordan","popularity":0.2613,"profile_path":"/nELFCK1hpF0pmhRSQy9EdWrVG6R.jpg","credit_id":"55adcbe79251411e0b009c82","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2189444","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vGgIbp1cECS4LAITPrp4AZ90Ok5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Camera Obscura Film Society (unconfirmed)","release_date":"1958-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
