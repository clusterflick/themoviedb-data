World famous landscape photographer Ken Duncan chases the light in an odyssey to get the perfect shot on the spectacular island gifted by Queen Victoria to the Pitcairn Islanders, mutineers from the Bounty, their Tahitian wives and their families and descendants.  Ken, the master, has his sidekick and protégé Ray Martin along with him and they link up with local photographer and underwater specialist Zach Sanders. Capturing their chase is one of Australia’s most awarded cinematographers Andy Taylor. Andy turns his own lens on the lensmen and Norfolk’s unforgettable scenery, characters, culture, and customs.","popularity":0.3429,"poster_path":"/bCkEdxFfVaxX637RPnjeF1Z41K8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205918,"logo_path":null,"name":"Latis
