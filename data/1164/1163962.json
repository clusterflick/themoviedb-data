A political gamble for its inhabitants, a myth for its visitors, Jerusalem remains a universal object of desire that borders on fetishism. The film takes its inspiration from the Jerusalem Syndrome, a psychiatric syndrome, officially recognised in the 19th century, and from which the pilgrims and tourists that visited the Holy City suffered. A camera visits Jerusalem looking for a new approach to show the city. In parallel a young boy wanders the streets and discovers one night a prostitute with golden breasts. The boy, as does the camera, becomes a victim of a violently feminine Jerusalem.\" - DAfilms","popularity":0.2284,"poster_path":"/3ER56okrdd0upVeJ1zilDfVd6wr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jerusalem(s), Borderline Syndrome","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Jerusalem(s), Borderline Syndrome","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932736,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eyal Sivan","original_name":"Eyal Sivan","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d778acb6c2641157538fc0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0190490","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":840,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3ER56okrdd0upVeJ1zilDfVd6wr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
