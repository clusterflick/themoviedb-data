Later it was staged also in Firenze (October ’86), Perugia (April ’87) and finally in Palermo (June ’87, part of the collective exhibition “Per amor del Cielo” at the Modern Art Gallery).  The installation is an ever-changing landscape of memories dedicated: “…to the black island, where a beloved shipwrecked friend, after having suffered for a long time has been turned into a fish”.  The theme of the work is the shipwreck in all of its allegorical meanings. Mixing music, electronic images, voices, scenographic materials, GMM re-proposes the poetic reconstruction of a seascape populated by fishermen, castaways, wrecks, hallucinated backgrounds.","popularity":0.1046,"poster_path":"/34ejbLgaX5SHWm8Jb2yoYkEyh86.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Movimenti sul Fondo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3166065,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giovanotti Mondani Meccanici","original_name":"Giovanotti Mondani Meccanici","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/nP631ytcd5RwlP6oqrs3N6q2G7j.jpg","credit_id":"64d77624f14dad00ad4ef8f1","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3166065,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giovanotti Mondani Meccanici","original_name":"Giovanotti Mondani Meccanici","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/nP631ytcd5RwlP6oqrs3N6q2G7j.jpg","credit_id":"64d77648001bbd00c6c6e129","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/34ejbLgaX5SHWm8Jb2yoYkEyh86.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rtch3KfIsti2L8pH0b5sku5NbDg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
