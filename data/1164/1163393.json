From there, Alejandro, a young lumpen, interacts with various characters that burst into the space, generating situations that allude to his minimal survival, reselling or exchanging objects. Voy y vuelvo is verbally organized with an anthropological approach, with the same interest of the director for the Mapuche dialect in Cautiverio Feliz and in Date una vuelta en el aire, and from there incorporates elements of popular culture and the notion of purgatory as a recurring figure.","popularity":0.065,"poster_path":"/nnn9OjeuFKSHxjGc7TdOvehfYit.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82743,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nómada Producciones","origin_country":""},{"id":77789,"logo_path":null,"name":"Warrior Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2023-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Voy y vuelvo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4366078,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan Cruz Palacios","original_name":"Juan Cruz Palacios","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"654ceb851ac2927b2f283074","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":2779950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iván Cáceres","original_name":"Iván Cáceres","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/4VIczsPhw1AsnJ8jgkc1eBRxXlw.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"654cebafd46537011b4b6017","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1453189,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cristián Sánchez","original_name":"Cristián Sánchez","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/2Km1hndUknUS61TI1HGCNSlahQ.jpg","credit_id":"64d56868021cee00ae518510","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1521805,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sebastián Pereira","original_name":"Sebastián Pereira","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654cea4bfd4f800101b8a3b1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2799357,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alex Mora","original_name":"Alex Mora","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654ceab9fd4f800101b8a3dc","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289817,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Diego Soto","original_name":"Diego Soto","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654ceacfd4653700ab947549","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289817,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Diego Soto","original_name":"Diego Soto","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654cea8229383501387d5eb7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1453189,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cristián Sánchez","original_name":"Cristián Sánchez","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/2Km1hndUknUS61TI1HGCNSlahQ.jpg","credit_id":"654cea75d46537011b4b5fb2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2625934,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Víctor Muñoz","original_name":"Víctor Muñoz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654cea9367b613011f41f6b6","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4366073,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alex Waghorn","original_name":"Alex Waghorn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654cea67d4653700c4e31cba","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1453189,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cristián Sánchez","original_name":"Cristián Sánchez","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/2Km1hndUknUS61TI1HGCNSlahQ.jpg","credit_id":"654cea1c2866fa108dc3d30e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289817,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Diego Soto","original_name":"Diego Soto","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654ceac3d4653700e1a6b5ec","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nnn9OjeuFKSHxjGc7TdOvehfYit.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival Internacional de Cine Valdivia","release_date":"2023-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
