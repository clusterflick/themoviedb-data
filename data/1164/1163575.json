When her mother needs money to settle her medical bill, she asks her godfather for assistance. Her godfather assigns Elena to abduct Fred Tan, the heir and grandson of one of the richest men in the Philippines, and hold him captive for ransom. When Elena succeeds in capturing Fred and is nearly apprehended by the police, they hide at a villa owned by Fred's family. While Elena is distracted, Fred tries to escape. Elena wrestles with him to prevent him from running away. In the midst of their argument, Fred's grandfather, Henry, pays a visit to the villa and sees them in an improper position. This leads to Henry planning to get them married as soon as possible. Now, Elena and Fred must pretend that their relationship is something more than a botched kidnapping.","popularity":0.59,"poster_path":"/2UJ466zim5AL46h7gJmejC5oHtj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8356,"logo_path":"/tais5f60IAWlBZvkU8KwjGvBUc4.png","name":"Viva Films","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2023-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kidnap For Romance","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":227135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cristine Reyes","original_name":"Cristine Reyes","popularity":1.5962,"profile_path":"/jHv8apcyAJLsZQdN3id2iGzGvvi.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64d6149ef14dad00ad4e48b7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1082683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Empoy Marquez","original_name":"Empoy Marquez","popularity":0.3485,"profile_path":"/vFs6KjBaKrfzjcc2VRXAlE4EcBf.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64d614b0bf31f201ccbe0c12","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1576192,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikko Natividad","original_name":"Nikko Natividad","popularity":0.2634,"profile_path":"/hWUvuBABRbfkM1COuhl2ZGeSidt.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64d61624b6c2641154f873b2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1499936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Debbie Garcia","original_name":"Debbie Garcia","popularity":5.668,"profile_path":"/epJlBtRbHXR6p6qK5NnbWU3kjLr.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"64d6163ed100b600ada08939","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"TJ Valderrama","original_name":"TJ Valderrama","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"64d6165ed100b600e268f326","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3705883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boboy Garrovillo","original_name":"Boboy Garrovillo","popularity":0.0549,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"64d61670f14dad011dfc6856","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1058265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yayo Aguila","original_name":"Yayo Aguila","popularity":0.4645,"profile_path":"/gSOCogk9uEzpqFgRLVGbtNbOp38.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"64d61688b6c264115752e510","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1456136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeric Raval","original_name":"Jeric Raval","popularity":0.4121,"profile_path":"/8JbbHrorAofEQnSUEHxon1fDxJ3.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"64d6169bbf31f201ca8b8988","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Archie Adamos","original_name":"Archie Adamos","popularity":0.264,"profile_path":"/p6Ix8lZJHy5SASjQ4cqbDyrI1HG.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"64d616b1d100b600c5d08f7e","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1550480,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marnie Lapus","original_name":"Marnie Lapus","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":"/saRKGM0Ke49wbIshcI7v8JlmM0L.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"64d616c4d100b600c5d08f8d","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":585894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricky Rivero","original_name":"Ricky Rivero","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/vWlCCqXGsYAKrSI4s6yPU0QWe3t.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"64d616e2db4ed60139599f42","order":10},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":2959345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Jake Cortez","original_name":"Billy Jake Cortez","popularity":0.706,"profile_path":"/aGSMfBoIg4PiwzVHVV9MJu1uh1R.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"","credit_id":"64d61704f495ee0290e30aa4","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2828927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kyo Quijano","original_name":"Kyo Quijano","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/9HLJYoHcfuuJrsB6Pu2Zzufu3xq.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"","credit_id":"64d6171ef495ee0290e30abd","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4208860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tyro Daylusan","original_name":"Tyro Daylusan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"","credit_id":"64d61742f14dad011dfc6919","order":13}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1360831,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victor Villanueva","original_name":"Victor Villanueva","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/5fEdANK6vAfS7llH0ANWpTjGYEQ.jpg","credit_id":"64d614d5bf31f201c94db76b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2039407,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roni S.
