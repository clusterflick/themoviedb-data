In large and small fragments, looking both inward and out, through a critical lens that is by turns social and personal, the film closely examines these underknown creatures. While The Night Visitors is interested in moths as organisms, with fascinating life histories, staggering biodiversity, and a functional importance as indicators of climate change and habitat degradation, its engagement with them is not primarily entomological. Instead, the film looks at moths as aesthetic beings and as carriers of meaning, aiming for a deep encounter with the beauty and incommensurability of the profoundly other.  The small hours of the night are threaded through with a sense of mortality and loss. Moths, with their trembling and exquisite impermanence, provide both a kind of solace and, in their diversity and difference, a focal point around which the desire to know can be organized.","popularity":0.0729,"poster_path":"/2itbaJfBQmrcbSU8ZjoLifUeSRy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Night Visitors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1836182,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Gitlin","original_name":"Michael Gitlin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/uzoiNnQ9gMGxk3T1627RdGwBC6s.jpg","credit_id":"64d563b0021cee013b72a0ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28753307","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.661,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2itbaJfBQmrcbSU8ZjoLifUeSRy.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":991},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kPPpFC5aAfrDf6wQrTSroiSzN43.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Seoul Animal Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New York Film Festival","release_date":"2023-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
