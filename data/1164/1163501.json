Two Dutch brothers in their sixties. Faces and bodies marked by a whole life spent traveling on the Rhein, the Maas, the Danube... They are born on the water and the boat is their only house. The Watna measures 86 meters in length, 11 in width and 12 meters in depth. Most of the time Harrie and Leon are alone in their daily routine, while outside the landscape flows restlessly away at a constant speed of twelve kilometers per hour. Huge industries and romantic castles. Cargo boats and luxury cruises. Observed from the cabin, the river banks appear unapproachable and fleeting, bound to a parallel temporal state where every matter seems to float suspended. Meals are often solitary and there is only little time to rest: Watna cannot stop its rush against time, since the profit on carriage of raw materials barely covers the costs of the shipping.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/rwR4XQ9TVSBxd2CbpEfFNGepZIm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Watna","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4181516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lorenzo Casali","original_name":"Lorenzo Casali","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d5d0cdf14dad00ad4e176e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2364075,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Micol Roubini","original_name":"Micol Roubini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d5d0dbdb4ed6011c4b8cbe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rwR4XQ9TVSBxd2CbpEfFNGepZIm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
