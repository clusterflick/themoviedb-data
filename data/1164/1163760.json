It is a celebration of the music of J S Bach as it is played, danced, sung, jazzed, computed, tapped, electrified and busked by a wide range of internationally renowned artists. Among the performers highlighted in this spectacular homage are jazz pianist Keith Jarrett, Christopher Hogwood and the Academy of Ancient Music, contralto Maureen Forrester, cellist Anner Bylsma, the Canadian Bass and the National Tap Dance Company.","popularity":0.1386,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":137750,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canada Broadcasting Corporation","origin_country":""},{"id":164,"logo_path":"/v3zcUepvKC7Vz36yjklk1rw6k8Q.png","name":"Rhombus Media","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":75168,"logo_path":"/7QhlWdkgNchV1XK194QTbFNGy6v.png","name":"TVO","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1985-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All That Bach","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1121482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Jarrett","original_name":"Keith Jarrett","popularity":0.1002,"profile_path":"/rWI5UtL8Rr8rUQGWRm3gdFbZzJg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64d698c4b6c2641158c6f5bf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1639636,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maureen Forrester","original_name":"Maureen Forrester","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/e0mdP1R2wqFGIBKCEhvt0jL6KKd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64d698e0f14dad01004b56f1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1027125,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Larry Weinstein","original_name":"Larry Weinstein","popularity":0.104,"profile_path":"/iQJKsuy5X4bgN9apc4eJeL8KkeY.jpg","credit_id":"64d69845f14dad00e3b82931","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0461898","wikidata_id":"Q123287655","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
