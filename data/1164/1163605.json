The Puguang City Police has been collecting evidence of the criminal team for many years to protect people's safety. The gang has a large number of people, uses the Internet to commit crimes, and the identity of the gang leader is mysterious. The gang members will always put the crime on the individual, or the witness will overturn the confession when he goes to court and will never involve the backbone members of the gang. One day, a brave girl changed everything. Yonglin walked into the anti-gang brigade of the Public Security Bureau to report the criminal gang. Tang Xi, head of the anti-crime brigade of Puguang City, led the police to conduct in-depth investigations, evidence collection, proof production, and arrests, and used the money left after Yonglin left to launch a one-off operation against gangsters within 72 hours.","popularity":0.0976,"poster_path":"/65z95iNCXBxgDAlLDkj7OvJ8kxI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"72 Hour Gold Operation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/65z95iNCXBxgDAlLDkj7OvJ8kxI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-08-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
