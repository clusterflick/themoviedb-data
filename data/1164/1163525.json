Primarily organized by then-Microsoft employee and principal architect of DirectX, Alex St. John, the event brought together 35 game developers, including id Software, who were given centre stage for the event via inclusion of the finals for Deathmatch '95, a previously organized and officially sponsored DWANGO multiplayer tournament for Doom and Doom II. Doom95 would play a pivotal role in the event as a part of Microsoft's continuing strategy to promote Windows 95's potential as a gaming platform. The event also served as the official release party for Raven Software's last Doom engine game, Hexen: Beyond Heretic.","popularity":0.0973,"poster_path":"/alw1RgaBKyZA96AHO7rjoIo1wOG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5133,"logo_path":"/6flSXpvY2t4SMWtRKyx26DTaMhf.png","name":"Microsoft","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Microsoft Judgment Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4163511,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alex St. John","original_name":"Alex St. John","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Devil","credit_id":"64d5e585d100b600c5d06cdd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4208707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Robar","original_name":"Jason Robar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Gamer","credit_id":"64d5e5a0f495ee02919e1d6b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4163511,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alex St. John","original_name":"Alex St. John","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d5e4dfdb4ed6011c4b98c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/alw1RgaBKyZA96AHO7rjoIo1wOG.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1995-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
