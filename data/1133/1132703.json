Desperate to get their faces Out There, they crop dust a neighborhood with their headshots, send t-shirts of their likenesses to directors-- only to find them ending up on homeless people-- all the while parading through town in absurdly \"quirky\" hats and sunglasses. On the way to chasing their dream, they must evade evictions, hit and run lawsuits, and the wrath of the tyrannous old lady running their favorite eatery... though not as successfully as Hollywood evades them. But it just might work out when they finally get their big break as the \"quirky nuns\" in something called a \"Skinemax flick.\"","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hairdos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1686104","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
