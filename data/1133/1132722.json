It is a film about the culture of winning. During one hot morning in Texas a bunch of students share the same playing fields. A high school PE soccer team scrimmages on the back field, the drama club rehearses on the side field, the college track team runs laps around the track, and the fifth grade football players practice right in the middle of it all. Sometimes the drive to win comes from within, and sometimes it comes from a coach, parent or teammate, but in all four cases the need to win takes all the fun out of the game. While there is plenty of action, this is not an ordinary sports flick. Ten-year olds clash helmets to a spaghetti western soundtrack and high schoolers break out in song. Does pressure ruin the game for everyone, or are there ways for individuals to shine even without being winners?","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Six in Austin: Out of Bounds","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0482126","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
