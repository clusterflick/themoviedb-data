An opportunity to challenge your own attitudes and view sex work through the perspective of the artists, the sex workers themselves. In 2016, Amnesty International chose to advocate for the decriminalisation of all aspects of consensual adult sex - sex work that does not involve coercion, exploitation or abuse. Community stigma impacts the law which in turn directly influences health, wellbeing and access to basic human rights.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Whore Pride","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4084380,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hélio Ribeiro","original_name":"Hélio Ribeiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64730b77a199a60116c76448","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
