Placed simultaneously between and beyond these two eras, the film becomes a lyrical lament for the promised New York that never was.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/yQGncGHNkRZr2vRUhVZ0rwcJG4A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89305,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinema Conservancy","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One More Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1038008,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manfred Kirchheimer","original_name":"Manfred Kirchheimer","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/9OwvvUNGiz3sKo4bX9tT7txI7QF.jpg","credit_id":"64715773dd731b00c0ba5370","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1038008,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manfred Kirchheimer","original_name":"Manfred Kirchheimer","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/9OwvvUNGiz3sKo4bX9tT7txI7QF.jpg","credit_id":"64715802dd731b00c0ba53cb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1038008,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manfred Kirchheimer","original_name":"Manfred Kirchheimer","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/9OwvvUNGiz3sKo4bX9tT7txI7QF.jpg","credit_id":"647156d5be2d4900dcda388c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2726441,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Walter Hess","original_name":"Walter Hess","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647157659ae61301466772d2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yQGncGHNkRZr2vRUhVZ0rwcJG4A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
