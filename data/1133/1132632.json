Is Mary (Auder) a wealthy housewife whose vacuous existence leaves her with nothing of substance to get a hold on her past-life? Or, is she the partner in crime of Sally (Hoffmann), who grifts off of the leftovers and vacant homes of this vacation community? This is the first feature of writer/director Nick Nehez. Auder and Hoffmann, daughters of Warhol Superstar Viva, have worked with directors Wim Wenders and Woody Allen among others. Nehez and Auder studied improvisational acting with Alan Arkin and the late Paul Sills.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Surrogate Mary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2004402","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
