Each of the directors wanted to show what they think about love and what it can be.  Marina Kalinina's film \"Ayyy Badym\" is the story of a visitor from Moscow who comes to visit his friend in Yakutia. During the hunt, he finds himself drawn into a mystical story that will affect the fate of a young couple.  Experimental film \"Neighbor\" by Nyurgun Fedorov is about the fact that love does not divide people by age, ethnicity or even gender. The feelings of two girls are certainly sincere and are able to resist the attacks of those in whose eyes it seems wrong.  The short film \"Love with Time\" by Ekaterina Abdulayeva tells the story of two people whose love has been able to stand the test of time. The story of how they found each other and were able to keep the feeling no matter what!","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/w5TEbfM6KoB5jOf7F2M3CAxEv10.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Такая разная любовь","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3015352,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marina Kalinina","original_name":"Marina Kalinina","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/oUPTbNZqGg4OFdZjwGyQP3hMqLx.jpg","credit_id":"64731d76a199a60116c76b86","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4084512,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nyurgun Fedorov","original_name":"Nyurgun Fedorov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64731d9b9408ec013e80b154","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4084514,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ekaterina Abdulaeva","original_name":"Ekaterina Abdulaeva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64731dbda199a600dc4ca967","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5l2ttlBFufaIvmOYBy3YUdcMtTP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1488,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w5TEbfM6KoB5jOf7F2M3CAxEv10.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1052}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
