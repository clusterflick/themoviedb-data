As the people of Derry city came together to commemorate the event, a bold new piece of musical theatre was staged in the Guildhall - the intended but never-reached destination for the fateful 1972 civil rights march. Commissioned by the cityâ€™s Playhouse Theatre, The White Handkerchief seeks to create a dramatic elegy to the 13 killed alongside those others injured, and to catalyse a creative legacy from those devastating events. The result is a bold experiment which renders the events of Bloody Sunday on a vivid new audio-visual canvas and seeks to inspire a new generation of local talent in musical theatre, offering a bright and unexpected legacy of that day 50 years ago. Filmed over nine months, this intimate portrait takes viewers into the heart of the production and a city striving to come to terms with the defining event of its recent history.","popularity":0.1617,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":114251,"logo_path":null,"name":"MVGroup","origin_country":""},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The White Handkerchief","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1993313,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vinny Cunningham","original_name":"Vinny Cunningham","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Host","credit_id":"64733538be2d4900f9941907","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1993312,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Peto","original_name":"John Peto","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Host","credit_id":"64733544a199a60116c775b4","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":318459,"name":"bloody sunday"},{"id":318460,"name":"londonderry"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
