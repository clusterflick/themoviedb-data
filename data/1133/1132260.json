Merline Saintil, a former Tech COO and Robin Washington, a former CFO, were well-known in the boardrooms of America. During an ordinary phone call between the two women, something extraordinary happenedâ€“ the movement to create an organization to expand the opportunity and exposure of Black women who can impact America's boards. Black Women on Boards, the now global organization of 200+ members, was conceived at that moment.","popularity":0.473,"poster_path":"/hiErhe6Mki0AUOSO2zQNj33C8V2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"OnBoard","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1095438,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deborah Riley Draper","original_name":"Deborah Riley Draper","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e0a868a39d0b0186087fb2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4564835,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Merline Saintil","original_name":"Merline Saintil","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e0a8c5daf57c01859c4541","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4564835,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Merline Saintil","original_name":"Merline Saintil","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e0a890a39d0b016307be07","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4564837,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shannon Nash","original_name":"Shannon Nash","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e0a8b4a284eb0187d441d0","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4564839,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mary Hentges","original_name":"Mary Hentges","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e0a8dd51f99a0185573859","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4564837,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shannon Nash","original_name":"Shannon Nash","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e0a8a651f99a0185573821","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4564851,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nathan Bowhall","original_name":"Nathan Bowhall","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e0a97451f99a018557392c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4564841,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lakecia Gunther","original_name":"Lakecia Gunther","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e0a8f9f8595801864f5e00","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1095438,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deborah Riley Draper","original_name":"Deborah Riley Draper","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64722e39be2d4900dcda91ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28234756","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hiErhe6Mki0AUOSO2zQNj33C8V2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":191731,"name":"female empowerment"},{"id":235671,"name":"gender equality"},{"id":291081,"name":"black woman"},{"id":309328,"name":"documentary short"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Vimeo","release_date":"2024-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"OnBoard: Story of Black Women On Boards","key":"775339839","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-11-26T18:47:17.000Z","id":"65e0a8525294e701864f7595"}]}}}
