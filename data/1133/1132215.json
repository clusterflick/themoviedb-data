Referencing the 1993 New Yorker cartoon by Peter Steiner, Nate King performs and composites an online identity of puppy play, a popular underground kink expression in LGBTQ+ spaces. King questions if we are able to share ourselves online while still retaining a sense of privacy. Despite being out as a gay and queer man over a decade and having explored pup play and other kink for years, King highlights a his own self-consciousness toward others finding out about his sex life. The piece is a way to unabashedly claim that space and recon with his own self judgments.","popularity":0.0504,"poster_path":"/m4LXbZij1Kai1eQLxVhlpUDWKXr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No One Knows I’m a Dog on the Internet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4083433,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nate King","original_name":"Nate King","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64721d998813e401035711d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28117850","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/m4LXbZij1Kai1eQLxVhlpUDWKXr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
