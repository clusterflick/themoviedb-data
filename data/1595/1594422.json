What begins as a simple teaching job quickly turns into a battle against deep-rooted injustice, corruption, and patriarchal traditions that shape the everyday life of the community.  Determined, outspoken, and fiercely idealistic, Almaz refuses to stay silent in the face of inequality. Her presence disrupts the village’s long-standing power dynamics, uncovering the struggles of ordinary people while highlighting the importance of education, civic responsibility, and women’s voices in society.  Shot across various regions of Azerbaijan, Citizen A blends personal drama with social commentary, offering a grounded and emotional portrait of a woman fighting for dignity and change in a world resistant to both.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":570,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Citizen A","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
