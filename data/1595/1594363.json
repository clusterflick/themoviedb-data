Japanese director Akane Yamada travelled to the war zone to document an often-overlooked story - the fate of animals and the people who reuse to abandon them. Known for her work in disaster zones since Fukushima, Yamada witnessed animal welfare groups mobilising at the Polish border to help refugees and their pets, and followed Ukrainians who continued to adopt shelter animals amid the chaos. In Borodianka, near Kyiv, she uncovered the tragic deaths of shelter dogs left behind during occupation. Her three-year investigation led her deep into Ukraine's frontline regions, from flooded Kherson after the Kahkovka Dam's destruction to a children's hospital in Kyiv struck by a missile. Through the stories of people who refuse to abandon animals even amid the devastation of war, this documentary portrays the resilience and dignity of those who refuse to surrender to violence.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/cOwRnnqWwoiLWHyfJ5JB1zLAUPe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Japanese filmaker's three-year journey in Ukraine, portraying the lives of animals and humans in war. \"Through dogs' eyes, the truth of war/\"","title":"Dogs and War: What I saw in Ukraine","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1251807,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Akane Yamada","original_name":"Akane Yamada","popularity":0.2186,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Them self","credit_id":"6934d3198a17d799df17b082","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1185386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masahiro Higashide","original_name":"東出昌大","popularity":1.9994,"profile_path":"/6YOBIQ22Y7ZCkuk50QRotvUAl7v.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6934d427a1a21707a4c1f3a9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5861837,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viktor Kopach","original_name":"Viktor Kopach","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Animal-id.net Representative","credit_id":"6934d4ba130074b3b805d30e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5861853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Przemysław Malik","original_name":"Przemysław Malik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Centaurus Foundation Shelter Manager, Poland","credit_id":"6934d5a2ea80ab509505d152","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5861855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olena Kolesnykova","original_name":"Olena Kolesnykova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Representatives of Animal Protection Group \"Hvostata Banda\", Ukraine","credit_id":"6934d5d072afe1b1d0c1f417","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5861856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anastasiia Onikova","original_name":"Anastasiia Onikova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Representatives of Animal Protection Group \"Hvostata Banda\", Ukraine","credit_id":"6934d5e4231e10e64b70aad8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5861857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ira Samoilenko","original_name":"Ira Samoilenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Member of Animal Protection Group \"Hvostata Banda\", Ukraine","credit_id":"6934d6039f8f2a4074b7107b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5861859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Representative of BREAKING THE CHAINS, UK","original_name":"Representative of BREAKING THE CHAINS, UK","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Tom Tommies","credit_id":"6934d624ce6073469bb71240","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1251807,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Akane Yamada","original_name":"Akane Yamada","popularity":0.2186,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6934d346aadd46352ec1f471","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1251807,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Akane Yamada","original_name":"Akane Yamada","popularity":0.2186,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6934d68ec9c11446bbd1fb6d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":898,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cOwRnnqWwoiLWHyfJ5JB1zLAUPe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":637}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15162,"name":"dog"},{"id":223378,"name":"animal rescue"},{"id":294795,"name":"war in ukraine"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-02-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
