The loss of the Vasa was a major setback for Sweden’s ambitions to become a power in the Baltic during a turbulent period of European history. Three centuries later, in 1961, the wreck of the Vasa was raised. Remarkably well preserved by the mud and water in the Baltic Sea, she is a 17th-century time machine. Following the work of archaeologists, divers and historians, this programme plunges into Stockholm harbour to make new discoveries and reveal more about the lives of those who built, sailed and died on one of the most powerfully armed warships of her time.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/v8SrSJhB3ND7hCDJc16O8ITK5HD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vasa: The Ghost Ship","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4730852,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charlotte Nottegham","original_name":"Charlotte Nottegham","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69359b37c9632c2bf070af5e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kM9XCrXUMd0OJaj0eVsdC7piuFe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/v8SrSJhB3ND7hCDJc16O8ITK5HD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jyDdE8Nmst955WuAv0FiQf2Y0aL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"This 1 hour BBC made documentary movie is not to be confused with the 2 Part TV Mini Series made by Factstory and Seppia Films called \"Vasa, le galion fantôme\".
