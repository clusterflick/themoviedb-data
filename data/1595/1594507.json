The film follows Danny, Mitch, Tommy, and Russell—four university friends approaching the end of their studies who realize adulthood is closer than they’d like to admit. Desperate for one last adventure before life changes forever, they set out along an abandoned countryside train line after hearing rumors of a long-lost drug plane that supposedly crashed decades ago.  What begins as a goofy treasure hunt quickly turns into something deeper. As they hike further into the forgotten outskirts of their hometown, old wounds and hidden fears come to the surface. Each step forces them to confront the uncertain futures they’ve been avoiding: fractured family ties, failing relationships, directionless ambition, and the overwhelming fear of growing up.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":282555,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dumb Cineboys","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2026-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"Friendship lasts forever.
