This group of 60 islands is one of the last pristine wildernesses on Earth.  The Chagos Archipelago is one of the world’s largest marine national parks, and is strictly protected. A scientific expedition has been granted access to this politically disputed territory for the first time. In times of climate change, as global reef communities face a growing crisis, the researchers seek to show how coral reefs fare in places with minimal human interference.  During a journey into the unknown, we follow in the footsteps of internationally renowned scientists, who aim to unlock the secrets of a lost world and gain astonishing insights into one of the last true wildernesses on Earth.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/knGoOv1Jn4nLaqUsKV0xcFiQYEB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46466,"logo_path":"/f48uQ4ggvURzB2hDIERueyzzOC9.png","name":"Gruppe
