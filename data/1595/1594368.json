Shot in contemporary Manchester to underline the work’s universal themes, this powerful film embraces a rich mix of locations: out along the city’s waterways, up among the skyline of an industrial car park, in hidden passages and pubs, under the stage of Bridgewater Hall for a devilish game of cards, and on stage where the musicians of the Hallé, directed by Sir Mark Elder, form a central part of the action.  A work devised to be 'read, played and danced', it is set to some of Stravinsky’s most entertaining and affecting music.  This production features a new English translation by Jeremy Sams.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A vibrant and bold new take on The Soldier’s Tale, Stravinsky’s dark masterpiece of music theatre about a soldier who trades his soul to the devil in return for untold riches","title":"The Soldier's Tale","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3060703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martins Imhangbe","original_name":"Martins Imhangbe","popularity":0.1874,"profile_path":"/ca8Zx7IuK1eNH7dCiLhjql28SEA.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Soldier","credit_id":"6934d90308827f406d70aafc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Katz","original_name":"Richard Katz","popularity":0.3955,"profile_path":"/crAR7zWiz6LhnJSxi6gNuRwQDRu.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6934d91533addc2000b710b6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1713561,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Lockyer","original_name":"Mark Lockyer","popularity":0.2719,"profile_path":"/bUhTKYhDLpW7aLl7C48yDXdEUHd.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Devil","credit_id":"6934d92482375ca71805d0dc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2112283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Faith Prendergast","original_name":"Faith Prendergast","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Princess","credit_id":"6934d932df276c917fd1fd3d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":974330,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Igor Stravinsky","original_name":"Игорь Стравинский","popularity":0.8413,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6934d85d21ad985d82243a36","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4058839,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Charles Ferdinand Ramuz","original_name":"Charles Ferdinand Ramuz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6934d87a70e7745cfb05d201","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1073310,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jeremy Sams","original_name":"Jeremy Sams","popularity":0.1045,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6934d8a7932ca1cf5405d0c0","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1566981,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annabel Arden","original_name":"Annabel Arden","popularity":0.0775,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6934d8bd82375ca71805d0c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1411985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Femi Elufowoju Jr.","original_name":"Femi Elufowoju Jr.","popularity":0.1723,"profile_path":"/8CmhUB0SMPLpeEOg3Qgs9NQbfJE.jpg","credit_id":"6934d8d029af7ad14505d279","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Elder","original_name":"Mark Elder","popularity":0.1343,"profile_path":"/wTR8N0JGrui4WAOxVF0TbK0xs62.jpg","credit_id":"6934d8ed6189424742243bdc","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26928790","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
