Lena, a guarded young artist, hides her feelings for Ethan—who secretly feels the same but fears losing their bond. Her bold best friend Mia masks her unraveling inner world with humor, while Jade’s fearless exterior cracks under the weight of being left behind. Ryan, the loyal peacekeeper, struggles as buried truths threaten to break the group apart. As summer fades and adulthood edges closer, one pivotal moment forces them to confront what they want, what they fear, and the risk of finally letting their true selves be seen.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":4,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"One Summer, 5 decisions.","title":"Parts of us","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
