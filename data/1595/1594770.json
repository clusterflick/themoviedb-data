At its heart is Aikaterini Valsamaki, a key yet largely forgotten figure of the rebellion at the Mega Livadi iron mines, who was imprisoned for her defiance. The film weaves memory, myth and feminist defiance, linking the stone-throwing women to the petrifying power of Medusa’s gaze, engraved in the island’s landscape.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stonethrowers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5863792,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sofia Dona","original_name":"Sofia Dona","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693603fde440f514c04e5022","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
