Late one afternoon, ‘Hawk’ Williams, a brutal convict, boasts of shooting ‘black crows’ – his slur for the land’s First Nations inhabitants. Jack threatens him in return, but is kept in check by the property owner.  Later that evening when the property owner has left, Hawk spots an Indigenous man at the tree line and rushes outside with his rifle, with Jack in pursuit. Knowing full well the punishment he faces if he intervenes, Jack witnesses Hawk fire and shoots him dead in return. As the police are summoned, all that remains is for him to wait for the law to take its inevitable course.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Drama, Historical, Short","title":"Black Crows","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5861637,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Curran","original_name":"Christopher Curran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6934b3a04cd69a528370a9f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5861637,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Curran","original_name":"Christopher Curran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6934b3af2e35466b1ed1fb84","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
