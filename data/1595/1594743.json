Sir Clive who was well known for his prior consumer technological triumphs such as the first LED electronic pocket calculator, miniature televisions, and the famous home computers the ZX81 and the ZX Spectrum (which many people cite as being the catalyst of the UK computer and software industry in the 1980s, and which many current programmers still quote as the start point of their careers).
