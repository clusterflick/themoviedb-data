He has governed Baden-Württemberg as Minister-President since 2011, longer than any of his predecessors. Soon, his tenure will come to an end: Kretschmann will not run again in the 2026 state election. This film takes stock of his time in office. A Catholic with a communist past. A conservative in a left-leaning party. A Green in the automotive heartland of Baden-Württemberg: Winfried Kretschmann’s political biography is a long journey marked by surprises and contradictions. Jenni Rieger and Jürgen Rose retrace this path. They speak with Kretschmann’s party colleagues and coalition partners, long-time close aides and early companions such as Joschka Fischer, Cem Özdemir, and Annalena Baerbock, as well as political rivals like Volker Bouffier, Markus Söder, and Bodo Ramelow.
