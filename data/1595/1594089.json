These are the grandparents who came here with nothing and died here with even less. They came to make their fortune in America, and most didn't succeed. Nevertheless, with their strengths and weaknesses, they contributed to building the nation.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"1988-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Balada de los abuelos que no hicieron la América","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5860907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Néstor Moragues","original_name":"Néstor Moragues","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693453d3231e10e64b70a8ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
