Through a moving series of interconnected stories, one man’s spiritual journey reveals how the average person hears the Gospel 76 times before accepting Christ — and how grace keeps calling even when we don’t listen. When he buys a struggling youth camp, his mission becomes clear: to make sure no one misses their opportunity to know Jesus.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Seventy-Six chances to say Yes to Jesus","title":"Missed Opportunities","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
