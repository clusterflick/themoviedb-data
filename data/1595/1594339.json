When a chorus of mooing from a nearby rabble of cows jolts her into reality, her body regurgitates a response: a deep and guttural moo.  As the woman observes the rhythm of the herd, she sees there is a strange, wordless peace in the simplicity of their world. She begins living like a cow, grazing on grass and hay and wandering aimlessly through the field. Nevertheless, this pantomime only makes their differences more obvious – and after she finds a small abandoned cowbell in the scrub, she embarks on a journey into the unknown to discover where it is she truly belongs.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"moo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3236183,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sarah Jo Fraser","original_name":"Sarah Jo Fraser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6934bb7c5d66bb771b4e4aac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
