This documentary follows the remarkable story of adventurers Juho, Sohvi, and their dog Nova, who deliberately freeze their vessel into the Arctic ice for the season. Filmed by a visiting documentarian who spends a week onboard, the short film offers an intimate look at the surprisingly ordinary life lived in an extraordinary location—exploring the resilience, routine, and profound isolation of spending a winter locked in the ice.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/lsvplVbtRK0ViOsLaeJP8f2JNJF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A unique and personal look at extreme living in the Alluring Arctic.","title":"Winter in Ice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5812843,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sohvi Kangasluoma","original_name":"Sohvi Kangasluoma","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/zt9evI2GKsvZlvs15d4ZA1AqplT.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6936127b54a2f5f2f6244095","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5814769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juho Karhu","original_name":"Juho Karhu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/tk8yF9N0Q2Eyo6kiB7TxM5K1E2c.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"693612b2f7208738464e5089","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5654207,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mikko-Pekka Karlin","original_name":"Mikko-Pekka Karlin","popularity":0.2374,"profile_path":"/dF47V1Uk1wVnAOn7B9ExnyaLErZ.jpg","credit_id":"693613620d4b1cb36605d66a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"alluringarctic","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lsvplVbtRK0ViOsLaeJP8f2JNJF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"OUR HOME FROZEN INTO ICE IN GREENLAND (181 Days of Winter)","key":"fzatT_xnVfA","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2025-12-06T10:28:05.000Z","id":"693611c9aa89eb7d4624408f"}]}}}
