Journalist Monique Daniels is newly married, expecting her first child, and grateful to God for her many blessings—until Harmony, a new assistant from the news station, enters her life.  What begins as casual workdays quietly spirals into daily drama as secrets, sabotage, and temptation rise to the surface. Someone is determined to destroy Monique’s family, her career, and her peace. As the tension escalates, her instincts as an investigative journalist sharpen, drawing her into a dangerous search for the truth.  In a gripping unraveling of deception, Monique is forced to confront a devastating reality: the news anchor isn’t just reporting the headline—she’s become it.  A tense, emotional roller coaster captured live on stage, Enemy in My House delivers powerful performances, sharp storytelling, and a shocking ending that leaves audiences breathless.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/5lHXnMUDA62V8EGeULKu41qmExZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126819,"logo_path":null,"name":"Parables Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"They had the perfect life.
