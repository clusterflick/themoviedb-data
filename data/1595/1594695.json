Despite excelling in all aspects of her life from academics to dance and singing Neha's world is overshadowed by the crushing pain of her family's turmoil. As her father succumbs to alcoholism, her mother's baseless accusations shift the blame onto Neha, turning her into the family's scapegoat. Abandoned even by her siblings, Neha must navigate her teenage years in profound solitude. This is a story about a girl living under the weight of undeserved negativity, and what happens when the one person who cared has gone.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":282583,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sensa pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":282584,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sensa studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2027-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":132,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"She was blamed for the silence.","title":"Neha","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5863372,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alwin Regnork","original_name":"Alwin Regnork","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6935d781078980ea25d1ff35","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5863375,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Smitha Regnork","original_name":"Smitha Regnork","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6935d8019b027be70270afa6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5863377,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Edwin Regnork","original_name":"Edwin Regnork","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6935d8197f6c18430f17b7a2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5863375,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Smitha Regnork","original_name":"Smitha Regnork","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6935d841a44b66cff44e4dd6","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5863377,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Edwin Regnork","original_name":"Edwin Regnork","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6935d8587bb9acbb33b7147b","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12279,"name":"family drama"},{"id":33626,"name":"millionaire"},{"id":264285,"name":"family entertainment"},{"id":298758,"name":"life"},{"id":320065,"name":"all ages"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ml","note":"","release_date":"2027-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
