The documentary discusses the “better in us” a needed collective perspective in the current climate of national disunity across racial, religious, and political lines. This has significant implications for addressing public issues from immigration to health care and the myriad of governmental, educational, business, and religious challenges that we must successfully meet to weave the fabric of unity which is indispensable to survival as a nation.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/vOPhL85EvEzDOteva5dHIePGYsm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An American Story: Race Amity and The Other Tradition","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5861769,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"William H.
