The film explores the long-term consequences of war and genocide in an attempt to understand the social, cultural, and historical context and experiences of rural villagers who seek out and dismantle UXO (unexploded ordnance) for profit. Part of a global economy, these individuals clear UXO from their land in order to protect their families from harm and to earn enough money to survive. Bomb Hunters is an eye-opening account investigating the on-going residual, persistent effects of war experienced by post-conflict nations around the globe, and the complex realities of achieving \"peace\".","popularity":0.4424,"poster_path":"/ymg9AYYeaeFJbcE3U3m4Hc8nmIU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14444,"logo_path":null,"name":"Collective Eye Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bomb Hunters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1986188,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Skye Fitzgerald","original_name":"Skye Fitzgerald","popularity":0.085,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665391ccd54e344446068562","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1986188,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Skye Fitzgerald","original_name":"Skye Fitzgerald","popularity":0.085,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665391dacae8ba7849b49479","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0963978","wikidata_id":"Q4940671","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ymg9AYYeaeFJbcE3U3m4Hc8nmIU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":506}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2960,"name":"cambodia"},{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":10983,"name":"anthropology"},{"id":14900,"name":"genocide"},{"id":18339,"name":"human rights"},{"id":167475,"name":"southeast asia"},{"id":193164,"name":"current affairs"},{"id":273967,"name":"war"},{"id":276777,"name":"asian studies"},{"id":307324,"name":"jackson hole"},{"id":314753,"name":"film festival"},{"id":328215,"name":"global studies"},{"id":331761,"name":"documentaries"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
