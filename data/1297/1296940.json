Shot one day during a break on the Ragged Glory Tour. Hip Hopped-up NYC roadie Maurice Menares plays the psychotic sidekick/bunny. Offensively endearing, in the face of P.E., N.W.A., REM, and Desert Storm. Chance occurrence of fire, predating the LA riots. Stopping at yard sales, ended up on Venice beach. By the end of the day, I went nuts. Keep in mind, this was at a time when \"Rico Suave\" by Gerrardo was in heavy rotation.","popularity":0.6962,"poster_path":"/z29YV27hpfEI98KovcUJGp1JXd6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rap Damage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thurston Moore","original_name":"Thurston Moore","popularity":0.2069,"profile_path":"/5MFuvfhH1S0X6lTrJxq3QywG0Dn.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66561b03513d8cb15f511a24","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4741310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Menares","original_name":"Maurice Menares","popularity":0.0481,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66561b1019f8e6841416c78f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101811,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Markey","original_name":"David Markey","popularity":0.3507,"profile_path":"/3rrt6IbT6x1tb3jIZbB090c3RZZ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66e391aaf467c2ad62f9445c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3632605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jordan Schwartz","original_name":"Jordan Schwartz","popularity":0.0437,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"RUN-DMC Fan","credit_id":"66e3994028048d92def93433","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101811,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Markey","original_name":"David Markey","popularity":0.3507,"profile_path":"/3rrt6IbT6x1tb3jIZbB090c3RZZ.jpg","credit_id":"66561b1f192dc8f70a212b10","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z29YV27hpfEI98KovcUJGp1JXd6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10570,"name":"roadie"},{"id":10849,"name":"sonic youth"},{"id":154950,"name":"venice beach, california"},{"id":207369,"name":"rabbit costume"},{"id":242921,"name":"rap"},{"id":249121,"name":"gangsta rap"},{"id":337924,"name":"wiggers"},{"id":337925,"name":"ebonics"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1991-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"RAP DAMAGE .
