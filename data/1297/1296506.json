This footage, described as \"the best tornado footage you will ever see\", was shot at incredibly close range, with debris pelting their vehicle, \"The War Horse.\"  With debris still falling and the roar fading, Jeff and Kathryn transitioned into search and rescue mode. They were the first to arrive on Iowa St., hit directly by the EF-5 tornado. Jeff pulled people from the rubble, while Kathryn cleared twisted metal beams from the road for rescuers.  Survivors Amber Munson, Ryan Tackett, Mark Lindquist (via his sister Linda Lindquist-Baldwin), Lucian Myers, and Judy Owens-Lowe share their stories of survival and courage.  Joplin begins its recovery with the help of thousands of volunteers. The Spirit of Joplin thrives as the community rebuilds, wearing the badge of honor that says: I AM JOPLIN!","popularity":0.0614,"poster_path":"/iTHyWwA6x7twp8BfsID19E34hKi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Capturing Courage: Jeff and Kathryn Piotrowski's Unmatched Tornado Footage and Joplin's Heroic Recovery","title":"Journey Through Tornado Alley: Storm Chasing The Joplin EF-5 Tornado","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4739145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Piotrowski","original_name":"Jeff Piotrowski","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/nrJ6Y86oA2SDOdB0QkLNVA1pgwP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6654b3573741a12b18ac65ef","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4739147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathryn Piotrowski","original_name":"Kathryn Piotrowski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6654b362dd4ad446c1ac65fe","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4739145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Piotrowski","original_name":"Jeff Piotrowski","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/nrJ6Y86oA2SDOdB0QkLNVA1pgwP.jpg","credit_id":"6654b3a23741a12b18ac65f6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":2233,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iTHyWwA6x7twp8BfsID19E34hKi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1591}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-05-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Devastating Joplin, Missouri EF-5 Tornado - May 22, 2011 and Aftermath","key":"EfdK6H9d6J0","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2011-06-05T23:40:38.000Z","id":"6654bcbb5ba4aa18d55a62ec"}]}}}
