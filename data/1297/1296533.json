The film is an effort to bring back the forgotten culture of \" putola naach\" of Assam as puppetry is used to make this film. The Covid pandemic had obstructed our lives in unimaginable ways but it gave us the time to revisit our roots, NAZNEEN7 Productions' presentation and CHINMOY BARMAâ€™s directorial \"Tezor Tukura\" is the result of the same. Another strong element of our short film is the \"menstrual cycle\".","popularity":0.076,"poster_path":"/473QwNAENScJE48HBEKi5xbG7P1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tezor
