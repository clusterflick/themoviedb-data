're-ma(r)king' is focused on two items that belonged to the artist's grandmother, which she animates through performance. On one screen, we see Raskopoulos unraveling a woven doily then winding this into a ball of thread, restoring the crafted object to its material origins. In the other, we see her dripping olive oil onto a concrete floor, then spreading it with a rolling pin as though preparing pastry. These actions invoke the power of mnemonic triggers to bring the past into the present. A portrait of the artist can be glimpsed in the reflective surface of the oil, partial and provisional, like memory itself.","popularity":0.07,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"re-ma(r)king","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4738554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugenia Raskopoulos","original_name":"Eugenia Raskopoulos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"665460afcd64b1006f06b93a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4738554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugenia Raskopoulos","original_name":"Eugenia Raskopoulos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665460a48d7688c580992e86","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
