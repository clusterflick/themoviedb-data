He has just completed his exams with excellent results and, what is more, he has become engaged to his great love, Lilly, a shipowner’s daughter. Her scorned suitor, Mr Bang, a merchant, whose proposal to Lilly was rejected shortly before, is incandescent with rage and hatches a malicious plan to get his rival out of the way. One evening, he lures Willy out to gamble and drink in an obscure harbour pub to get him shanghaied. The plan is to get Willy drunk, make him accept a loan from the pub landlord and sign a receipt which is actually a blank contract committing him to service on board a ship. Bang’s dastardly scheme succeeds, and before Willy realises what is happening, he has become a slave on a half-rotten wreck of a ship, ‘The Octopus’.
