Burning Mirror presents scenes of everyday life in Beijing reflected in mirrored plastic. The images quiver and then blacken and melt away as the reflective sheet is set alight and small flames become an engulfing fire. Passers-by are shown paying little attention to the blazing performance. Song Dong has often worked with fire and mirrors, capturing moments of reflection, destruction and restoration in powerfully understated performances involving everyday objects and locations.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Burning mirror","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3745031,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Song Dong","original_name":"Song Dong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66545f4b6ac858d61db4bc6e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
