This quickly escalates to a violent confrontation as Officer TJ Meadows III accidentally shoots and kills his partner, Officer Kevin Cooper, with his backup gun. Years later, no longer a cop and still traumatised, he moves back to Pittsburgh and finds his way to his partner’s widow, Kacie. They slowly fall in love as Kacie confronts the history she’s been avoiding, including telling her 15-year-old son, Ralph, TJ’s backstory.","popularity":0.4179,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"The Gun on Second Street","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1603909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Poppy Delevingne","original_name":"Poppy Delevingne","popularity":0.2367,"profile_path":"/4EZa9PCZpQMZfrUZ7Wl2xzRSoue.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Kacie","credit_id":"6654858ee4a1e3dd189b7891","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Arnold","original_name":"Tom Arnold","popularity":1.1934,"profile_path":"/z2ajL1ozVCS4Ug04zOGCNH06OPP.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"665486547d56fd989803f476","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1727268,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rohit Karn Batra","original_name":"Rohit Karn Batra","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665485a47ee7bb0c5a06b5a6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1727268,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rohit Karn Batra","original_name":"Rohit Karn Batra","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665485ab46b56f8cbd31b42a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1727268,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rohit Karn Batra","original_name":"Rohit Karn Batra","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665485b26ac858d61db4bdc6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62927,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guy J.
