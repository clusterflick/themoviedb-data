Collapsed amphitheatres, flooded bunkers and labyrinths of open-air corridors are periodically ravaged by drought and covered over again by vegetation. In this setting, an artist sets up his easel. Children and adults have fun by the lake and stroll past ruined buildings. A painting session takes place among pigs, dogs and chickens. On the upper platform, military personnel supervise the area.","popularity":0.0418,"poster_path":"/3PzdAiLqke86gzPr41mI1oF0i0z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ruínas de Navarone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4739299,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcela Tamm","original_name":"Marcela Tamm","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6654c3f8a0b573c7384b543e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1602,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3PzdAiLqke86gzPr41mI1oF0i0z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1066}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
