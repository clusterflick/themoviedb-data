One day, Jessen announces that his boss is coming to visit from Australia, and that he will bring along his daughter, Alice. Jessen further proclaims that he wants one of his sons to marry Alice. Full of prejudice against Australians, Fritz and Jørgen end up drawing lots to determine who must accept this terrible fate. Upon arriving in Denmark, Alice decides to send her friend Elsie ahead to the country house to take the measure of the two fellows and report back to her. She pretends to be Alice, and to complicate things further, Fritz and Jørgen have in the meantime hired two strange vagabonds, Pat and Patachon, to pretend to be them, hoping that this will make her turn around and leave immediately.
