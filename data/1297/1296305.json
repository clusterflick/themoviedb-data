Radha, driven by a passion for acting, faces the harsh realities of domestic servitude after a childhood marriage, sacrificing her dreams for survival. Maya's quest for a better life leads her to Kuwait, where she becomes ensnared in the horrors of human trafficking but ultimately escapes to rebuild her life through entrepreneurship back home. Sundari, despite being a specially- abled dwarf, rises as a priestess in a male-dominated role, overcoming discrimination with unwavering resilience and devotion. Sukun, discriminated against for her low caste, perseveres amidst Nepal's majestic mountains, crafting handmade products to support her family and defy societal constraints. Each woman's story exemplifies the power of determination, resilience, and the refusal to be defined by circumstance, inspiring women everywhere to pursue their dreams against all odds.","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":"/vnzIgHRzblPtVNEpWD33usBaJcu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101648,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wayne Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NP","name":"Nepal"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Nepali","iso_639_1":"ne","name":""}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"Women's Empowerment and the Battle for Survival","title":"The Unsilenced: Women's Empowerment and the Battle for Survival","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4738330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Radha Shrestha","original_name":"Radha Shrestha","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"665429826f9f4a3ac89b894b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4738331,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amisha Patel","original_name":"Amisha Patel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"665429900f9b0999908cd336","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4738332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maya Bhandari","original_name":"Maya Bhandari","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6654299b0ae3b1e71c8cd1ef","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4738333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sukun Rasaili","original_name":"Sukun Rasaili","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"665429add8d0d8ac3b911d10","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4738334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sukun Rasauli","original_name":"Sukun Rasauli","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"665429bc81bab4e2064cc621","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4738335,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sushma Karki","original_name":"Sushma Karki","popularity":0.0739,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"665429dd5c837f2bbea0c9b9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4738336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sundari Mishra","original_name":"Sundari Mishra","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"665429eb9e5f8e061a443411","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4738327,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tosit Ghatane","original_name":"Tosit Ghatane","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66542944c4aeef8678270b42","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4738327,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tosit Ghatane","original_name":"Tosit Ghatane","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66542927c09a81366f06b7a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4738329,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lamichhane Pramod","original_name":"Lamichhane Pramod","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66542962a7f29156c6a0cb5e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32022652","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1349,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vnzIgHRzblPtVNEpWD33usBaJcu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
