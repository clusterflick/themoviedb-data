This hallowed spot is to host a match between two of the finest swordsmen in Edo. Each is backed by a high ranking direct vassal of the shogun, who had bet their family heirlooms on the outcome. The loser was to commit seppuku and have his clan disbanded. Meanwhile a band of brigands are placing their bets on the fencer who had earlier killed their leader. Can retired master swordsman Akiyama Kohei keep this from becoming a major disaster?","popularity":0.6791,"poster_path":"/sSmUlMo71kcUUDLwx264XsUXdFi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2005-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Samurai Justice: A Duel at Takadanobara","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takashi Naito","original_name":"内藤剛志","popularity":0.5194,"profile_path":"/xwsm0ygjG79jLIogutwo6r64igy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6653ca830f9b0999908caa04","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1071783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ayako Kobayashi","original_name":"小林綾子","popularity":0.8489,"profile_path":"/dxCHYtko0dqwiEaODxzM6HFpcLv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6653ca8ca4642d618002cdfb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":127682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chie Tanaka","original_name":"Chie Tanaka","popularity":0.5103,"profile_path":"/yqOz7CB7p8yUq1MSIDScscwxb7z.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6653ca94986236d3f20c8347","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1253564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Makoto Fujita","original_name":"藤田まこと","popularity":0.6389,"profile_path":"/pkqf88iGk4ER0lDKkRylE58GdhZ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6653ca9d67f770a6a54c9cd7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kai Shishido","original_name":"宍戸開","popularity":0.3372,"profile_path":"/q2D2pUDG7T4qzSoNUMxMiEZjtti.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6653caa5c3f4352806440b26","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikijiro Hira","original_name":"平幹二朗","popularity":0.5177,"profile_path":"/7OHrgODTFBp0xRuIQI9JfEtTEnx.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6653cab7ae5d4114219b54ec","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":83527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shinobu Terajima","original_name":"寺島しのぶ","popularity":1.7311,"profile_path":"/tOk9ggHemFL5FCvhfYeIkyS3Fk9.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6653cae2f57db61bc998fd19","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":25461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meiko Kaji","original_name":"梶芽衣子","popularity":0.835,"profile_path":"/vX5QZ9oyncMWL6zyhhVycepN4tm.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6653cafd6ac858d61db496c7","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150289,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Akira Inoue","original_name":"井上昭","popularity":0.2769,"profile_path":"/8eTFrwBMFvYFAdZVICwY0CJFy1c.jpg","credit_id":"6653ca62bee65c0e2802cd71","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228526,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shōtarō Ikenami","original_name":"池波正太郎","popularity":0.1662,"profile_path":"/bjwxak6JGOpkOpO7lZKnMYethdI.jpg","credit_id":"6653ca78cd64b1006f068737","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/sSmUlMo71kcUUDLwx264XsUXdFi.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":186753,"name":"jidaigeki"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2005-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
