The works move tonally towards soft-core science fiction, in pursuit of a state of weirdness: a disconnection of understanding coupled with stabilising scenarios, the artist attempts to visually preview scenarios in order to do the future self a ‘solid’ by predicting obstacles and self-fulfilling cycles. The work looks through an un-reality to something that is close to an anxiousness about the future.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/zmM0BKBSl701Z9eLSGSS5KuMBIC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Horizon Plays Itself Back Into Being","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4193576,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Collette Rayner","original_name":"Collette Rayner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ca4e4285b10500ff011cab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2211,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zmM0BKBSl701Z9eLSGSS5KuMBIC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1474}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
