He was quickly adopted by local mountaineers and became the first guide in the Company not to have been born in the valley. He is also an insatiable explorer, in love with landscapes and peoples, having traveled from the Hoggar to the Sami camps in Lapland. And the author, among others, of the famous adventure novel Premier de Cordée! This documentary, made up of archive images and interviews, exposes the prolific life of a man who communicated his passion for the mountains by all possible means. A young journalist from Chamonix follows in the footsteps of Roger Frison-Roche. She meets people who knew him and others who followed in his footsteps: guides, filmmaker and author Philippe Claudel, a director, his family; on a trip to Lapland, Algeria, Chamonix.","popularity":0.5482,"poster_path":"/7p9SvjjNTMozC9YpSTyLmtOIcMw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205289,"logo_path":"/7hgAtp8SVIhEG9olR80zstjx6mZ.png","name":"Intrepide
