Throughout the performance, the audience can hear the whispers of excerpts from literary works that have somehow suffered from censorship, while the performers take over the space and create explicit imagery that sometimes collaborates in the staging, sometimes disorient understanding.","popularity":0.1877,"poster_path":"/ww3khHrmbd2BNtIeh9bT4NOwvay.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205277,"logo_path":null,"name":"FANJO","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2021-07-21","revenue":10000,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sombra","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2973159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andres
