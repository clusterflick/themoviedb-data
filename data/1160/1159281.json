Those who do not draw attention to themselves and their help goes unnoticed at times. They constantly put in work where it’s most needed, because they feel like they are the ones who need it the most. Need to do it. Need to help. For the sake of their humanness and their honor. Rivne City Hospital. An ordinary clinic in an ordinary Ukrainian town. This is about those people who care. Those who consider Ukrainian land their home.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/sYijE41WLAunClO30lAnrohrilX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2023-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"War Wihin a War","title":"Unnoticeable","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4641465,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oleksandr Bochko","original_name":"Oleksandr Bochko","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/aMmQfrBlLm6R4l1Zi1bjH9ScC4m.jpg","credit_id":"6613efe99408ec017d2b5eb8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4641465,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oleksandr Bochko","original_name":"Oleksandr Bochko","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/aMmQfrBlLm6R4l1Zi1bjH9ScC4m.jpg","credit_id":"6613f0b23d7454014806b50c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4641465,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oleksandr Bochko","original_name":"Oleksandr Bochko","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/aMmQfrBlLm6R4l1Zi1bjH9ScC4m.jpg","credit_id":"6613f0bf9408ec01302a121b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4641466,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mykhailo Klykov","original_name":"Mykhailo Klykov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6613f0d359008601627d0ffb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4641479,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Roman Poliukhovych","original_name":"Roman Poliukhovych","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6613f5785437f501847e2fe8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28491337","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/6lf9yaX7s1K9M7Do1Xjhxto6KCp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sYijE41WLAunClO30lAnrohrilX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"CINEMA FOR VICTORY Ukrainian International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Doc Kyiv Fest","release_date":"2024-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"YouTube","release_date":"2024-02-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Best Shorts Competition","release_date":"2023-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
