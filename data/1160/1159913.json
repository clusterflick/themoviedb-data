From the period of the slave trade through the mid-70s, this film shows how the legal system had been used against poor communities in general and people of color in particular. At the same time it presents a history of continuous resistance to unjust laws in the United States. WE DEMAND FREEDOM contains footage from prisons in California, Texas, Massachusetts and New Jersey and documents the point of view of a group of prisoners that are becoming aware of their potential as a powerful political force.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Demand Freedom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3569367,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Allan Siegel","original_name":"Allan Siegel","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cb8e784fd141012709a607","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
