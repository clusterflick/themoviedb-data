The narration departs from a book titled ‘Wild Nature’s Way’ by the Kearton brothers – two British naturalists and pioneers in wildlife photographers – but it expands to diverse related subjects. It raises questions on basic but yet extremely contemporary human behaviour: the ongoing urge to observe, record and study, in order to control and conquer. Our relationship with animals evolves, and becomes increasingly complex in this era of rapid technological changes","popularity":0.0468,"poster_path":"/yUZRSbset80tPsOyOEvlabv0YV2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Getting inside the head of an ox","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3763840,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Cristina Lavosi","original_name":"Cristina Lavosi","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ca6664dd83fa00ff518f47","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":870,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yUZRSbset80tPsOyOEvlabv0YV2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":580}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Trixie, The Hague","release_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
