James gets a room and finds nothing suspicious until he discovers that the apartment was really a rocket in disguise, intending to kidnap everyone in the building and enslave them for an outer space amusement park.

The Chief congratulates Agent Hound for a successful mission and gives him the apartment as a reward. Unfortunately, James has trouble sleeping due to the noisy airplanes taking off by his window.","popularity":0.1494,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Phantom Skyscraper","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":997915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dayton Allen","original_name":"Dayton Allen","popularity":0.116,"profile_path":"/96daHXsHhRFhHTPEHQBplvk78gP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"James Hound","credit_id":"64c9dfae0b74e900ea8b88df","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1332211,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eli Bauer","original_name":"Eli Bauer","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c9dfc7d3719700e20a583a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":173620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Al Kouzel","original_name":"Al Kouzel","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c9dfde0b74e9012c70edb1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1269884,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Art Bartsch","original_name":"Art Bartsch","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c9e001bf09d1013becd5c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116338,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Dave Tendlar","original_name":"Dave Tendlar","popularity":0.0527,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c9e00cd3719700ac4ea4dc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0150502","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Specific release date not listed","release_date":"1966-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
