Marion Keisker is able to put the record straight about what really happened on those very early recording sessions. But so too is Sam Phillips with quite fascinating results.  Also featured are many other characters and personalities who played their own parts in the early days of Elvis' career including his life-long friend George Klein together with Rufus Thomas, Wink Martindale, Chet Atkins, Bill Randle and his first Boss at the Crown Electric Company.  With the addition of exclusive location footage in Memphis, this film presents the definitive story of the Sun Days as recalled by those who were there. As such it is not only a fascinating historical item but also a fitting tribute to the late Marion Keisker.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/8WD0hz5DaagKIarDNjmRTynNB9Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205255,"logo_path":null,"name":"EPFC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elvis Presley: Golden Years","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4191859,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bernard Roughton","original_name":"Bernard Roughton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c92a92595a56011cbd067b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0978804","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8WD0hz5DaagKIarDNjmRTynNB9Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"6","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2004-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
