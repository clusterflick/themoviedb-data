The film traces the religion’s arrival from India over 2000 years ago, emphasizing its purest form as practiced in Ceylon. It highlights key rituals such as the Festival of Lights, the veneration of the Bodhi tree, and the Buddhist monastic journey. The documentary also contrasts the discipline of Buddhist teachings with the occasional resort to amulets and Hindu deities, offering a comprehensive view of Sri Lanka’s Buddhist culture and its path toward nirvana.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/vh9G7pyemy8ODspBidk5oIPaOOC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25006,"logo_path":"/ziWQdswTHwQ9V40O4kvhc2DYYBK.png","name":"Institut für Film und Bild in Wissenschaft und Unterricht","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1963-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Buddhismus in Ceylon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1349555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Zils","original_name":"Paul Zils","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a4dd8cea49de7ac02fd902","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1349555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Zils","original_name":"Paul Zils","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a4dd94bf36040c5d85ca30","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1295043,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Reggie Siriwardena","original_name":"Reggie Siriwardena","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a4dda0bf36040c5d85ca34","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vh9G7pyemy8ODspBidk5oIPaOOC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1963-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
