Nan-ryeong has also written a novel, titled 'The Women Who Brush Their Teeth Outside', influenced by Jin-soul. Jin-soul, who feels a strange sense of connection to Nan-ryeong, reads her novel on the train returning to Seoul. A story of two people who somehow overlap. But, while Jin-soul has been cleverly hiding behind a pseudonym, Ju-ok, Nan-ryeong is open about who she really is. Eventually, the insidious relationship between the two is exposed, and cracks begin to form in Jin-soul′s seemingly happy life.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"The Women Who Brush Their Teeth Outside","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2999285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shin Sun","original_name":"Shin Sun","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/4RwD4yqgJDI4HbMQL0TrV2D3E1.jpg","credit_id":"64cb50ca764b99013af666f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
