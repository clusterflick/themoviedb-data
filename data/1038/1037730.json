One of these film reels shows a woman who reminds the addressee of a former girlfriend. Immediately and without paying attention to his obligations to the company, he drives the company car to the city of his childhood friend, 780 km away. There he finds out that she has been the secret lover of his Super 8 friend for years. After about three or four weeks, which they spend on the coast of another country without any significant difficulties, the lover of the childhood friend rows his boat alone across the Atlantic after an obviously frame-up rescue operation.","popularity":0.1954,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":184536,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bildstrich","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1985-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zombies und Dromomanen - Die blinden Vögel unterwegs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Ebert","original_name":"Christian Ebert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"63512f07f3b49a007a839feb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3749153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manfred Studer","original_name":"Manfred Studer","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"63512f11a843c1007a9f8881","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3749154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre DuTemps","original_name":"Pierre DuTemps","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"63512f2284448e007f774a5a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":567089,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alina Reyes","original_name":"Alina Reyes","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/o3eJwh7Eaob4jbtt4q2HZaAyjuF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"63512f34a843c10091b1e816","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3749154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre DuTemps","original_name":"Pierre DuTemps","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63512f544ca676007fe33c4a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3749154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre DuTemps","original_name":"Pierre DuTemps","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63512f63880c92007e6f2ecf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3749155,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alf Obrisch","original_name":"Alf Obrisch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63512f74f3b49a007dd2c8f2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3749156,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Birger Burstoff","original_name":"Birger Burstoff","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63512f88076ce80091764e0c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3749157,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Angela Rüpke","original_name":"Angela Rüpke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63512fb156b9f7009935662f","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costumer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1810130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johannes Kirschbaum","original_name":"Johannes Kirschbaum","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63512fc0a843c1007a9f88ca","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3749165,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Lorenz Grimm","original_name":"Lorenz Grimm","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63513090076ce8007f005f10","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3749167,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Wolfgang Behling","original_name":"Wolfgang Behling","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635130a6be4b36007c67fdb7","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2924593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theo Janssen","original_name":"Theo Janssen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635130c1880c9200796c7d66","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":128,"name":"love triangle"},{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"},{"id":160329,"name":"super 8mm footage"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"IFF-Forum Berlin","release_date":"1985-02-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
