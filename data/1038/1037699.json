In order to establish this binary logic, traditional cinema initially hides the fact of the camera's gaze. Entirely in line with the tradition of feminist filmmaking, TRANS*GAZE breaks with this convention from the start: We see backstage lighting, stage markings and accessories. The subjects speak expressively and convincingly about what Jack Halberstam describes as \"queer time and space\" as they look directly into the camera: trans*gaze.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2021-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"TRANS*GAZE","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3748992,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rosa Wiesauer","original_name":"Rosa Wiesauer","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/wm8aDXGP9RyOUMkSv0OG9TQYcva.jpg","credit_id":"6351143556b9f7007b129546","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22797790","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
