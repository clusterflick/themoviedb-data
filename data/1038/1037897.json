In this version, Zhu Shilin tackles the anxiety concerning the clash of 20th century Chinese traditions and modern Western culture. Despite her father’s strict discipline, Fun still manages to have a boyfriend secretly and give birth to twins. After leaving her son to her father, she takes off with her daughter. Twenty years later, Fun has become a streetwalker. The three generations finally come face-to-face at the police station. Her father laments that his generation should be ousted while Fun’s generation has been sacrificed, leaving the future for the next generation to establish. Zhu carefully depicts the shame of selling one’s body without passing judgment while he finds balance and reflects on the pain in the age of progress. Even though the production was far from lavish, Zhu’s astute handling of the narrative and mise-en-scène makes this a vivid and exciting film to watch.","popularity":0.5337,"poster_path":"/iuUWxdj7uIjx3xth1WeV2DKiNbJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1948-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Third Generation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3749993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wang Xichun","original_name":"Wang Xichun","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"635196eabe4b36007c681b1e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1593089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jiang Ming","original_name":"Jiang Ming","popularity":0.1649,"profile_path":"/7FohC5EEDC5dqaU88TBzS5x1CqA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"635196f456b9f70099358621","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2050158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gu Ye-Lu","original_name":"Gu Ye-Lu","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"635196febe4b36007c681b23","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1178451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chen Qi","original_name":"Chen Qi","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/jejz10hme61sAlgP2F7DzoMD1nA.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"63519709417aaf007f695ade","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1586654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hung Po","original_name":"Hung Po","popularity":0.182,"profile_path":"/tgbbRJdlZ4vRGSBGa3tOOnQ5GRY.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"66442cfa0c18fad3842411ab","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158863,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cen Fan","original_name":"岑范","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":"/qfqnGK5pLNSRLfIPBL8Axrrl1Aa.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"66446360781c4b29fb77f72f","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158504,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhu Shilin","original_name":"Zhu Shilin","popularity":0.1581,"profile_path":"/qsC7NApZbCkXn02v86wWTC2Sk2Y.jpg","credit_id":"63519732417aaf007f695aed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158504,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhu Shilin","original_name":"Zhu Shilin","popularity":0.1581,"profile_path":"/qsC7NApZbCkXn02v86wWTC2Sk2Y.jpg","credit_id":"6351973ad8e225007a1991fd","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2222649,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yuen Chang-Sam","original_name":"Yuen Chang-Sam","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6446b2e676484104fabe6b88","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0205006","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iuUWxdj7uIjx3xth1WeV2DKiNbJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2200,"name":"generations conflict"},{"id":2384,"name":"modernity"},{"id":9714,"name":"remake"},{"id":237178,"name":"women in film"},{"id":258973,"name":"mother son estrangement"},{"id":305387,"name":"westernisation in china"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"1948-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
