A veteran journalist father, a policeman son and an activist daughter are living in a torn society of Hong Kong. The trios in the Suen family are caught off-guard by the teasing of Moerae, or the Goddess of Destiny. In philately, \"tête-bêche\", or head-to-tail in English, is used to referred to a pair of generic stamps which is inverted in relation to one another, either through a printing error or intentionally. The stamps are of special value only when they are unseparated. Metaphorically, \"tête-bêche\" can precisely reflected the portrayed family's tricky situation, that different role-plays or value judgments can lead to sparkling tension among family members, yet somehow the old saying of \"blood is thicker than water\" prevails.","popularity":0.094,"poster_path":"/yUrrcrUK9j21VYmi7gnCzfl2IKe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2018-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Head-to-tail","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":551605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Yuen","original_name":"袁富華","popularity":0.4722,"profile_path":"/hqjCEPxNxxldgWCaXznomO64Lp9.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67da7214594cac1ee76caf6f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3748615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luther Ng","original_name":"Luther Ng","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6350bcbe35818f0081389fa2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8890288","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":2833,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yUrrcrUK9j21VYmi7gnCzfl2IKe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"香港獨立電影節","release_date":"2018-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Tête-bêche（Head-To-Tail）trailer 2 香港獨立電影《對倒》預告片 2","key":"hGOKqX-QnGg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-03-20T12:38:57.000Z","id":"6350be6a2fdec600818673d7"}]}}}
