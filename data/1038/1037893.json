For 75 years Max Wolff has captured pre and post war Jewish life on film as a way to cope with his own trauma. Captured chronicles Batya's reviewing the image archive, hoping the nearly 100,000 photographs can help her process the past and provide a new clarity in the lives of her and her two sisters. The film is an evocative exploration of memory and family dynamics that often plague children of Holocaust survivors.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Captured","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3749985,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arnoud Holleman","original_name":"Arnoud Holleman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63519470c99826007ddc42dc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3749987,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Batya Wolff","original_name":"Batya Wolff","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6351947fc99826008297723d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
