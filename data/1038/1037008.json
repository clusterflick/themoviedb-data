War has ravaged Europe continuously for the last seventeen years. The common citizens of Stockholm live in misery as poverty, violence and death dominate the shadowy alleys. A coup feels inevitable and the coming dissolvement of the nation is what's on everyone's lips. In a beautiful salon six nobles are hiding away from it all by partying and socializing. One night the hostess Charlotte reveals to her five guests that she will be forced to sign over her property to one of them, for fear of otherwise losing it to the rebelling antigustavians.  A game begins in the candlelit salon. A game of covert intentions, manipulation and mind games as five nobles attempt to find out who of them is best suited to take over the beautfiul estate. Time passes as they're all constantly driven towards their own personal abysses. All meanwhile the sounds of gunshots and yelling echo from beyond the gilded window sills.","popularity":0.4471,"poster_path":"/zGzUjxMkPtoE63JIXZ4jKEQCv4J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2022-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The
