In the first scene our hero waits at the bus stop looking indifferently at his cell phone as time passes and then returns home where he mechanically turns on the television and passively watches a blank screen. Then in a grocery store the heroine mechanically puts the products in her bag without listening. Then our hero watches a teleconference and by the end of it he has not heard anything of what was said, while then being hungry he warms up and \"eats\" water. At the same time, our heroine is walking down the street and as she looks up she fearfully notices that everyone around her is wearing a headscarf and can't see. Finally, the heroine who has been watering a flower pot on her balcony for days discovers how the flower inside is made of paper.\r The film was made in the context of the 5th Panorama Film School of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki with the theme DEACTIVATION.","popularity":0.0398,"poster_path":"/cRLIU4il54P8pWbNYLUK3Ukfyto.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178672,"logo_path":"/8joqZUDTpKoP3fNlUgIULcCZueX.png","name":"Panorama Film School of A.U.Th.","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Disabled Beings","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3748341,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Morfoula Kaila","original_name":"Morfoula Kaila","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63506bf0596a910091925b99","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3748342,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anastasis Koumanderis","original_name":"Anastasis Koumanderis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63506c01880c9200900a15ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cRLIU4il54P8pWbNYLUK3Ukfyto.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"5th Panorama","release_date":"2021-05-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"Cinobo: 5th Panorama","release_date":"2021-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
