They live in nature, off nature and against nature. Illegal wood selling seems to be their only chance to feed their families. At the same time, they are destroying – tree by tree – their own livelihood. This quiet observation ends with the arduous transport of the wood out of the forest. Anyone who thinks ahead knows that it will end up in our apartments, too, as a mahogany table or Bangkirai floor.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/67q4xWKvUsQokYNIs0ARHc1t4VQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68539,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hochschule für Bildende Künste Hamburg","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2022-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"},{"english_name":"Javanese","iso_639_1":"jv","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kayu Besi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3748410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Max Sänger","original_name":"Max Sänger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6350796884448e007a5c6e9d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3748410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Max Sänger","original_name":"Max Sänger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635079814ca67600825b8c84","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3748410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Max Sänger","original_name":"Max Sänger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635075e4f3b49a007a8355f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3748412,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrianus Oetjoe","original_name":"Andrianus Oetjoe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63507624c1ffbd007eeec466","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/67q4xWKvUsQokYNIs0ARHc1t4VQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":896}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DokLeipzig","release_date":"2022-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
