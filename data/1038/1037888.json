This marked the first time in history that a Torah was dedicated to an Arab-Muslim ruler. This fascinating documentary takes us behind the scenes of their efforts and interactions with the Sheikh and the rulers. As evidenced by the film’s title and its shared meaning in Hebrew, Arabic and English, this film celebrates the breath of ‘good news’ toward greater tolerance and co-existence in the Arab Peninsula.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amen, Amen, Amen: A Story for Our Times","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3749967,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Gallagher","original_name":"Tom Gallagher","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6351905a076ce8007f008081","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18547228","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-12-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
