Thunberg isn't a politician or a scientist, nor is she the first to campaign against climate change. However, since overcoming severe childhood depression to focus the world's attention on the plight of the planet, the Swedish student has become symbol for a generation which - as she puts it - is not being listened to by older people who won't suffer the consequences. In a challenging and wide-ranging conversation, Rajan discusses with Thunberg her latest book and interrogates some of the solutions it posits to tackle climate change. They explore green policy, climate justice, greenwashing and the role of both politics and protest in effecting change. Thunberg also shares the personal cost she has paid in being a global game-changer and offers a rare insight into the real Greta Thunberg.","popularity":0.9101,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Amol Rajan talks to 19-year old Greta Thunberg.","title":"Amol Rajan Interviews Greta Thunberg","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2297949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greta Thunberg","original_name":"Greta Thunberg","popularity":0.3173,"profile_path":"/r4qHgSvuVk79NOCy4vyqpPbXkpg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6350428884448e009153d820","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2221747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amol Rajan","original_name":"Amol Rajan","popularity":0.1613,"profile_path":"/eSXVC3n79ehT2URxsDfHbVeKSOD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Interviewer","credit_id":"6350429d544c41007ff46eff","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1671361,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Edward Capes","original_name":"Edward Capes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635042f856b9f70099351729","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1902386,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sophie Deveson","original_name":"Sophie Deveson","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635042c7596a91007a14cd96","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1914065,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lorian Reed-Drake","original_name":"Lorian Reed-Drake","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635042ddb42242007ffb8cc3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22853256","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3693,"name":"climate"},{"id":2210,"name":"climate change"},{"id":4434,"name":"interview"},{"id":154815,"name":"environmentalist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
