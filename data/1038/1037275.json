He has 6 degrees and owes his notoriety to his past career as a magician, chansonnier, politician. He is also the founder of the Theurgical Order of Elios and the Church of the Living, a cult with more than 20,000 followers, in which he has the role of a self-proclaimed God. Obstructed in the first stages of its production by the Covid-19 pandemic, the film unfolds over one long year of exchanges at distance between the director and the “Divine”, through Skype conversations in which the manifold topics relating to his multifaceted existence are treated. Significant figures who have been variously connected with his earthly life are also involved in this long journey of knowledge, contributing with their precious testimonies and blurring further our understanding of such a complex and layered figure.","popularity":0.0652,"poster_path":"/nv3R0yQNFswFlDoP7Tc9oyy2JGm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115725,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lab 80 film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2022-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Life of Otelma the Divine","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":3747572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Amleto Belelli","original_name":"Marco Amleto Belelli","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Divino Otelma","credit_id":"634fe05d596a910091921fec","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1380320,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luca Ferri","original_name":"Luca Ferri","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634fe0294ca676007fe2acf1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2725126,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrea Miele","original_name":"Andrea Miele","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634fe087596a91007a14908b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2515753,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrea Zanoli","original_name":"Andrea Zanoli","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634fe09ba0f1a2007cdca189","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1380320,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luca Ferri","original_name":"Luca Ferri","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634fe01dbe4b36007c677fad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":3747572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Amleto Belelli","original_name":"Marco Amleto Belelli","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634fe0bed363e5007d03652e","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1380324,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Duccio Servi","original_name":"Duccio Servi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ae0bfcbe4b36008a6cfd0b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2075,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/irCyci7S1w8t5ZAScfDsM4Ir1b2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3689}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nv3R0yQNFswFlDoP7Tc9oyy2JGm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"VM18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Torino Film Festival","release_date":"2022-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
