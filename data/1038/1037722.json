She shot and taped hundreds of minutes—unique visual and sound recordings of Makonde culture. One seeks to portray the woman behind the records from those trips, from her youth in Germany in the 1920s, to meeting and marrying Portuguese ethnologist Jorge Dias, to the missions they made together to the then Portuguese colony. As she meets with Makonde people today and hands them back these images, the director seeks the gaze of the other director, whom she knew at the end of her life.","popularity":0.0687,"poster_path":"/whHOfP2KXgxm9DWlIOvGPwKwARi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Margot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289576,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Pedro Mateus Duarte","original_name":"Pedro Mateus Duarte","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652be650f28838029f32c0fd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1769577,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"João Ribeiro","original_name":"João Ribeiro","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652be656ea84c700aef30373","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2387385,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gonçalo Ferreira","original_name":"Gonçalo Ferreira","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652be66a024ec800e4453d2c","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2736102,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"João Alves","original_name":"João Alves","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652be6740cb33516f5c9d77b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1018918,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pedro Borges","original_name":"Pedro Borges","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652be65ef28838029f32c103","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1619764,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Armanda Carvalho","original_name":"Armanda Carvalho","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652be6b9ea84c700ca110f68","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2406215,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gabriel Mondlane","original_name":"Gabriel Mondlane","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652be6ca358da7011dd8a4be","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1776323,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Catarina Alves Costa","original_name":"Catarina Alves Costa","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/5B9411ZCeXoH3DZEUjLlSvJrjHL.jpg","credit_id":"6351286a5f4b73008d55d274","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/whHOfP2KXgxm9DWlIOvGPwKwARi.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
