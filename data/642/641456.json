Commissioned by the Nagano Prefectural Department of Tourism, the movie became instead, in the hands of Kamei, a depiction, sometimes ironic, of poverty and the harsh life of the inhabitants of the area. The short movie is often considered Japan’s first “poetic documentary”.","popularity":0.104,"poster_path":"/8vxhkjJ4kQFMtgnItGtkcquBQbI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":622,"logo_path":null,"name":"Toho Eiga Co., Ltd.","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1941-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kobayashi Issa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1464238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Musei Tokugawa","original_name":"徳川夢声","popularity":0.1367,"profile_path":"/fOcuV6scYdkgn4tzlMDrLyNjAIG.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"6562e33c706e56011b4a74f0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086514,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Masao Oki","original_name":"大木正夫","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6562e318fb529900e3e3601f","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1706826,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eizo Sakai","original_name":"Eizo Sakai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6562e329244182014e899fd7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2043552,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Shigeru Shirai","original_name":"白井茂","popularity":0.0754,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dae9c3eb5bc21001671b4a7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1197589,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fumio Kamei","original_name":"亀井文夫","popularity":0.1772,"profile_path":"/r3NJrl8TnGWTY4PjEEgFmPeP3j1.jpg","credit_id":"5dae9c211cac8c00130b8aa5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0440799","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.723,"height":866,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8vxhkjJ4kQFMtgnItGtkcquBQbI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":626}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"Source: IMDb","release_date":"1941-02-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
