Given the freedom to wander the set as they pleased, the Lebon’s received unrestricted access and a privileged insight into the filmmaking process of Korine - a long time inspiration for both brothers. They came home with thousands of photographs and 50+ hours of footage which was edited down over the course of the intervening year, and has resulted in two distinct pieces of collaborative work - a twenty-minute film and a limited-edition photographic book titled 'Inside the Bum'.","popularity":0.1116,"poster_path":"/yVkVjVu9hgnLNLlaXEn3I20Lqay.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38060,"logo_path":null,"name":"DoBeDo Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inside the Bum","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harmony Korine","original_name":"Harmony Korine","popularity":0.5038,"profile_path":"/nifHx1FlQdgYw57QaUfHSjBKmPy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"60106843cb8028003f08c2fb","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4356127,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Lescher","original_name":"John Lescher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654561bd9cc67b00fc7f5bbe","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4356139,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lachlan Munro","original_name":"Lachlan Munro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6545646c41a561336883014a","department":"Crew","job":"Additional Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2244995,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joseph Bicknell","original_name":"Joseph Bicknell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654564837719d700c51f35ca","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1681790,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Roi Cydulkin","original_name":"Roi Cydulkin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6545636ed8cc4a00ad2291b4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3173903,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dylan Weathered","original_name":"Dylan Weathered","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654561cb41a561336c5bf7bd","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4356134,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Adam Lebon","original_name":"Adam Lebon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654563a141a561336d83c972","department":"Editing","job":"Additional Editing"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4356143,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Will Berger","original_name":"Will Berger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654564f16beaea014b67182e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4356135,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leon Vynehall","original_name":"Leon Vynehall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654563de2866fa00ab105d79","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1384348,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tyrone Lebon","original_name":"Tyrone Lebon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db05b6a65c26c0018fd3d1f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2439064,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Lebon","original_name":"Frank Lebon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db05b64cabfe4001422dc59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yVkVjVu9hgnLNLlaXEn3I20Lqay.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
