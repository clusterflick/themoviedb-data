The beach where he had first played football is gone; it has been stripped of its sand and is now nothing more than rocks and pebbles. Those who had previously earned a living from fishing are now selling sand just to survive. Where once there had been enough fish to provide an income for fishing families, now each day is a struggle to find enough to eat. The reasons are all around the archipelago: EU vessels returning home with fish from Cape Verde. Overfishing by European boats has far-reaching and serious consequences, so why is no one questioning it? Sandgrains is a film about what happens when people start asking a simple question: why?","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sandgrains","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2706504","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
