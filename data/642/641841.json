The two subjects undergo therapy sessions as part of the assessment during which they are asked to re-enact the most traumatic and formative events from their childhood. With the aim to try and ensure the deepest look into the minds of these individuals, before the psychologists make the assessments and their identities are revealed. A reveal that shakes up the idea of right and wrong and opens a discussion about the most important topic of our times.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/gCnbqEGlBBqU3H750jPVWEg4X59.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2019-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Could This Be You?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3697788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Townsend","original_name":"Alex Townsend","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"631f191c5684630083cd2ac5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3697789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Micol Ascoli","original_name":"Micol Ascoli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"631f192eb87aec008283c739","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3697790,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Alexander","original_name":"James Alexander","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"631f193dbd32090082733b13","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3697791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Turtle","original_name":"Josh Turtle","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"631f1947b87aec007f89cb59","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3697792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adrian Furnham","original_name":"Adrian Furnham","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"631f19500bb076008023f64e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3697794,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Regan Stokes","original_name":"Regan Stokes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"631f195c568463007bbe2f7a","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1183409,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Agnieszka Lukasiak","original_name":"Agnieszka Lukasiak","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db0a91a629b2c00182c01b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8446880","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1462,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7om7t0i8zST8tcKjwM9hLLa7IAN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2598}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gCnbqEGlBBqU3H750jPVWEg4X59.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
