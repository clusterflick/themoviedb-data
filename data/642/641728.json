This leads to festivities including the breaking of the piñata, which in turn leads to Donald Duck trying to break his own piñata as well.","popularity":0.2853,"poster_path":"/pDolssYsnkgukNwSz8Hxk7ZDOt8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1944-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Las Posadas","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarence Nash","original_name":"Clarence Nash","popularity":0.467,"profile_path":"/x2g2hbu4RRIcn6Q5RT8gpWR1FKV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Donald Duck (voice)","credit_id":"673e0471b23054898da3992c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joaquin Garay","original_name":"Joaquin Garay","popularity":0.1402,"profile_path":"/yCgHRSx4HessPgJZn8GIWEXtyY3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Panchito Pistoles (voice)","credit_id":"673e04d6f48b04b8d90570c8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Oliveira","original_name":"José Oliveira","popularity":0.0632,"profile_path":"/ogLgSsd2htOFs2oCR43jAVePmJd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"José Carioca (voice)","credit_id":"673e056f8e357a2ded959915","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ycVQAIHcw7LsIJyCkxBaFYU9OFV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pDolssYsnkgukNwSz8Hxk7ZDOt8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1944-12-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
