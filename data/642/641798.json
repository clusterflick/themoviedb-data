Based obliquely on Yoko Ono’s book, the piece works on many levels to reposition this mythic tale of the Beatles by casting '80s women in mod drag—effectively mapping the lesbian sub-culture onto heterosexual mass culture. Discounting the importance of reproducing facts and historical accuracy, Dougherty gives an incisive reading of the creation of pop culture icons: it doesn’t matter who plays John Lennon because ultimately John Lennon is not a person anymore. As a star, he is a projection of our society’s collective needs and desires.","popularity":0.2886,"poster_path":"/LECPTwGVPT22Ny01mRDgOCmfP6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grapefruit","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Grapefruit, the Story of John and Yoko","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2439182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jill Garellick","original_name":"Jill Garellick","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Paul McCartney","credit_id":"5db07776bfeb8b00131dccab","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2341415,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Azian Nurudin","original_name":"Azian Nurudin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"George Harrison","credit_id":"5db07791ecaef5001125b1e7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1327722,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Shelley Cook","original_name":"Shelley Cook","popularity":0.21,"profile_path":"/wv54qkRAFWjaeL6gfmtp3pgp3ZU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Yoko Ono","credit_id":"5db078f0cabfe400122317ee","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1429026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susie Bright","original_name":"Susie Bright","popularity":1.094,"profile_path":"/zVO2CUNkbwNhzo54Idzt0gLucDB.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"John Lennon","credit_id":"5db07904bfeb8b00111ddebf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2439185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Aragon","original_name":"Kate Aragon","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Ringo Star","credit_id":"5db0791aecaef500172562b8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2439186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Didi Dunphy","original_name":"Didi Dunphy","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"go-go dancer","credit_id":"5db0793265c26c0018fd7050","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":36191,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rick Groel","original_name":"Rick Groel","popularity":0.0739,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"go-go dancer","credit_id":"5db0794765c26c0018fd7066","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1719066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cecilia Dougherty","original_name":"Cecilia Dougherty","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db071dacabfe40012230ce8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2439187,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Margo Adams","original_name":"Margo Adams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db0795d1cac8c001b0e83e3","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0095251","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/LECPTwGVPT22Ny01mRDgOCmfP6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1988-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Grapefruit (excerpt)","key":"31576479","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2011-11-03T23:45:33.000Z","id":"5db078a965c26c0013fd9a0f"}]}}}
