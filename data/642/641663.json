A Japanese diplomat, Mr.A.O. started for his assignment to Berlin since 1929. He was also the person fascinated by filmmaking. Of course, generally said his films were just the \"Home Movie\", however when we saw his films carefully, we could be found out the sensibility of other filmmakers in 20s, just like Ruttmann, Vertov or so. I'd like to observe the lost films.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ytsgQHwszltBqeYU94z9wYZrUdX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Berlin in the Winter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1760413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ichiro Sueoka","original_name":"Ichiro Sueoka","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dafba84ecaef50013241b66","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ytsgQHwszltBqeYU94z9wYZrUdX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Image Forum Festival, Yokohama","release_date":"2004-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Image Forum Festival, Tokyo","release_date":"2004-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Image Forum Festival, Kyoto","release_date":"2004-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Video Cosmology","release_date":"2004-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Yale University","release_date":"2006-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Onion City Experimental Film and Video Festival","release_date":"2004-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
