This German romanticist poet wrote of the sadness of disappearance. An anonymous amateur cineaste shot some scenes in Kyoto in 1934. This footage has since suffered from typical vinegar syndrome (Hydrolysis) resulting from improper storage. The films were falling into decay and would probably eventually disintegrate without being seen again by anyone. \"Film\" is not a immortal document, but a vanishing existence. The film which we can know may be merely slight.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/eDc6WOp7inWc5K5sf84RTg7XjIB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2003-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am Lost to the World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1760413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ichiro Sueoka","original_name":"Ichiro Sueoka","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dafb977ecaef5001124154c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eDc6WOp7inWc5K5sf84RTg7XjIB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"London Film Festival","release_date":"2003-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"S.F.G.
