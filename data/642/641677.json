Some popular and some not so well known sights of the city shine in this urban travelogue lark, including the Griffith Observatory, Angel's Flight funicular railway, and a sailboat cruise from San Pedro, culminating in the evening's highlight, a visit to the Cinerama Dome Theater in Hollywood. This was the first film shot in 3-panel Cinerama in 50 years.","popularity":0.8387,"poster_path":"/fZe0pJ3c1j7AJZjNOeuPt7kwUPP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"For the first time in 50 years, the cinerama cameras roll to take you on a virtual reality tour of iconic Los Angeles sites.","title":"In the Picture","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stanley Livingston","original_name":"Stanley Livingston","popularity":0.161,"profile_path":"/36cbq6quOvCp16vImGKf1jhFwBX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Stanley","credit_id":"5dafd892ecaef500172462af","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2438836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paula Drake","original_name":"Paula Drake","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Paula","credit_id":"5dafd8a309dda40016e03581","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1297243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Domínguez","original_name":"Elizabeth Domínguez","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/1DJbxXtNxbNxDLclSXjoUTfZcn4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Elizabeth","credit_id":"5dafd8b109dda40016e03589","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2006755,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Matthew Brewbaker","original_name":"Matthew Brewbaker","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Matt Brewbaker","credit_id":"5dafd8c109dda40013e029a8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Debbie Reynolds","original_name":"Debbie Reynolds","popularity":1.354,"profile_path":"/9Z9DQqNztKlinANGGgD5dQODtlr.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Aunt Lilith","credit_id":"5dafd8d5ecaef50011244dee","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1712018,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Strohmaier","original_name":"David Strohmaier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dafd8e61cac8c00150d6356","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1712018,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Strohmaier","original_name":"David Strohmaier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dafd8efdc1cb40017283ccb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stanley Livingston","original_name":"Stanley Livingston","popularity":0.161,"profile_path":"/36cbq6quOvCp16vImGKf1jhFwBX.jpg","credit_id":"5dafd908ecaef500172463cb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2150281,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anthony J.
