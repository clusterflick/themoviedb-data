These nomads are deemed the “Blue Men” due to their bluish complexion — not a racial characteristic, but the consequence of color from their clothing staining their skin. Each morning, they turn to Mecca and thank Allah for the blessing of their remaining liberty, that liberty which, in spite of all the pain and hardships, they would not exchange for houses, which they could not carry on their journeys, nor for radios, since the world outside does not exist for them, nor for watches, since it is not their custom to count the time.","popularity":0.538,"poster_path":"/g1sfmnpKk8lc6wPpxjqP5S6bwRt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1957-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Blue Men of Morocco","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63670,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Winston Hibler","original_name":"Winston Hibler","popularity":0.2811,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5daf63aeecaef500172398d6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148822,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ralph Wright","original_name":"Ralph Wright","popularity":0.3049,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5daf634b09dda40011df78f7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11426,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ben Sharpsteen","original_name":"Ben Sharpsteen","popularity":0.2769,"profile_path":"/nfruaWGIjvI99oXmyzmsnGkdDL9.jpg","credit_id":"5daf6360ecaef50011239507","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2438659,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Raymond Bricon","original_name":"Raymond Bricon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5daf63821cac8c00150ca0c7","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","credit_id":"5daf636ab5bc210016730bfe","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64868,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Oliver Wallace","original_name":"Oliver Wallace","popularity":0.1098,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5daf637709dda40016df6ff7","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2438660,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jack Vandagriff","original_name":"Jack Vandagriff","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5daf6396ecaef500172398be","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63670,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Winston Hibler","original_name":"Winston Hibler","popularity":0.2811,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5daf6337dc1cb40017276801","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148822,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ralph Wright","original_name":"Ralph Wright","popularity":0.3049,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5daf632e1cac8c00130d0dc0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2438653,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Harrison Negley","original_name":"Harrison Negley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5daf634109dda40016df6fd5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10075246","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.66,"height":909,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/g1sfmnpKk8lc6wPpxjqP5S6bwRt.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9fhUHSPduOIo5ZB5X7LocpzD626.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1957-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
