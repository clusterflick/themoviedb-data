Drinking to excess and barely holding down his job as a teacher, he's a man lost with nothing to live for. But the sudden news that the boy who killed his wife, Scottish born Donald McKinley, has been released early from prison, brings monumental change for Soter and gives him a new motivation. He begins a journey to a small coastal town, where he hopes to find his tormentor, to find an answer and perhaps to ultimately find redemption. Exploring the themes of loss, forgiveness, revenge and the tragedy of an existence locked in the past, Ashes is a complex character study and a thrilling dramatic modern fable.","popularity":0.5265,"poster_path":"/rlu1TN8GcdphUJ0YT58iuDhNUoE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ashes","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86480,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rupert Procter","original_name":"Rupert Procter","popularity":0.1763,"profile_path":"/7zqt1889yGFUDwVKZcQKX51CWZa.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jonathan Soter","credit_id":"607f62a27776f0003f6a6d49","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3061227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graeme Rooney","original_name":"Graeme Rooney","popularity":0.115,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Donnie McKinley","credit_id":"607f62d2955c6500414de95a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1698428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Wood","original_name":"Mark Wood","popularity":0.0846,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Kenny Tennant","credit_id":"607f632e8b959e002935b9cd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":158414,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Perry","original_name":"Jane Perry","popularity":0.1532,"profile_path":"/gajiGfToSOUQvfy7wy8TwZi6hW9.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Rebecca Soter","credit_id":"607f63629f37b00078d7dcf5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3061228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandra McNeeley","original_name":"Sandra McNeeley","popularity":0.1246,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Sally Tomlin","credit_id":"607f6390713ed4007d0ed927","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3061229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca McQuillan","original_name":"Rebecca McQuillan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Mary Tennant","credit_id":"607f63aaaa659e002aed66c8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3061230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Petrie","original_name":"Ian Petrie","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Georgie","credit_id":"607f63c2160e73007718242c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1413420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Presley","original_name":"Ben Presley","popularity":0.1725,"profile_path":"/uALSxKhbxNvW0UExdAdwO8MwNh1.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Dim","credit_id":"607f63d77e3483002948e1e4","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3061231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Ritchie","original_name":"Dan Ritchie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Deck","credit_id":"607f63ee2b8a430057f21f11","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Robinson","original_name":"James Robinson","popularity":0.6145,"profile_path":"/zESqY8KKwkTsuEx75n7Jaumn8ho.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Kipp","credit_id":"607f64049f37b00029b2c78b","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2493221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allan Sawers","original_name":"Allan Sawers","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Pete","credit_id":"607f64187e3483002948e246","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3065000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Davies","original_name":"Anne Davies","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Herself -
