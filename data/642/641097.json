He resides there with his son Juanjo (17), a sensitive teenager who keeps him company and confronts him openly. Suffering from acute kidney disease which keeps him from competing professionally, Antonio is stuck in limbo, halfway between his glorious past and the impossibility of being who he once was. However, he is unwilling to give up his lifestyle, even if it kills him. In an attempt to reinvent himself, and seeking a better future for his son, Antonio plans a comeback to the Mexico bodybuilding scene, where he may relive his glory days.","popularity":0.8291,"poster_path":"/l9abdv1y1zibuVfiFsj3mQhdEcG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117907,"logo_path":null,"name":"Montelona
