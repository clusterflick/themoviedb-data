Keith Doolin’s case is now a race against time. In late 2016, voters in California elected to speed up the death penalty process whilst Doolin’s defence lawyers claim they have uncovered credible new key evidence that will exonerate Doolin and could save his life and free him.","popularity":0.3868,"poster_path":"/f10YIXnSBOYTyw3Kbp0VYuAItvj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83626,"logo_path":"/iRQpVyoDVresVCsbfvqoityaw0b.png","name":"Pernel Media","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"20 Years on Death Row","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2438682,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Agnès Buthion","original_name":"Agnès Buthion","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5daf782409dda40011df91bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1955522,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Samuel Kissous","original_name":"Samuel Kissous","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5daf785cecaef5001123b443","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/63YbwozFfxX5hkiz8F57N3kxVSR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2w0OcacbFt8wD5TdEvOgBhCTjS7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/f10YIXnSBOYTyw3Kbp0VYuAItvj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12662,"name":"wrongful imprisonment"},{"id":33722,"name":"true crime"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
