Bob, the eldest, is sullen and revengeful, and Mae is afraid of him. Will, the middle brother, is a happy-go-lucky boy with whom she falls in love, and Charlie, the youngest, sacrifices his own feelings for Will, who loves Charlie devotedly. Will and Mae are engaged. During his absence in the city, where he is trying to get a hold in business, so that he and Mae can marry, Bob makes violent love to his brother's fiancée. Charlie comes to her rescue. Learning of the episode, Will later has word sent home that he is dead, and Mae marries Charlie. Some time after this, Will cannot resist coming home to see his mother and Charlie, though he intends that Mae shall not know of his return. Before he can slip away, however, an incident occurs in which he is called upon to save Charlie's life. His presence and his heroism become known to Mae. The inference is that she had a good deal of a struggle to overcome vain regrets.","popularity":0.2554,"poster_path":"/xkGDkbqWLHyPtNPgf3BPtwYUuMY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4760,"logo_path":null,"name":"Majestic Motion Picture Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Three Brothers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wallace Reid","original_name":"Wallace Reid","popularity":0.2366,"profile_path":"/dE0MD7mJe8VmRIxoxvfTyqrAl3p.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jean Gaudet / Will","credit_id":"5dad640eb2681f001697b87c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1313506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allan Sears","original_name":"Allan Sears","popularity":0.091,"profile_path":"/yFsG56zHqVdlA5gVGpZqYd1Oxiy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"François Gaudet / Bob","credit_id":"5dad641bae366800179a5767","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1533333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Hinckley","original_name":"William Hinckley","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Pierre Gaudet / Charlie","credit_id":"5dad642aae366800149a5e3f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1367069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Anderson","original_name":"Claire Anderson","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/xfM9WSlMfgu5XRxKzMW9OtJxlBs.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Cousin Julie Archambeau / Mae","credit_id":"5dad643dae366800149a5ea8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1300231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cora Drew","original_name":"Cora Drew","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/WgbFxrhGJQd3bsliBYCUdbRw4B.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The Widow Gaudet","credit_id":"5dad644aae366800179a5775","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90375,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christy Cabanne","original_name":"Christy Cabanne","popularity":0.2211,"profile_path":"/a7kRCLGEln54oL9ZqA7UblFAIDH.jpg","credit_id":"5dad63d6fea6e30013ad77b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0006158","wikidata_id":"Q3989629","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1469,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xkGDkbqWLHyPtNPgf3BPtwYUuMY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":979},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oVnbQ3CiyPWFljP7pP7d5ekGHt5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1915-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
