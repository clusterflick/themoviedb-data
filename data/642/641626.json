Our long journey together could only be given new meaning again. I set out, with considerable reserve, to make the second part of the film that in 2018 had had a favorable reception all over the world. I thought for a long time about how to make use again of her words, her drawings and her silences. Angela and I filmed and wrote two parallel diaries. The images I shot around Europe, America and elsewhere fit perfectly with her writings.","popularity":0.0454,"poster_path":"/6I7zs05TdLXP5hCbFoRc2REGqfC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76361,"logo_path":null,"name":"In Between Art Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2019-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Armenian","iso_639_1":"hy","name":""},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Angela’s Diaries.
