Lofton juxtaposes images of black men from late 60s and early 70s films with images of Black Panther Party demonstrations, as a way of intentionally revising history. The soundtrack is punctuated by a 1970 quotation from Black Panther leader Huey Newton:  \"There's nothing to say that a homosexual cannot also be a revolutionary. Quite on the contrary, maybe a homosexual could be the most revolutionary...\"  O Happy Day blurs the difference between the Black Power movement and the Gay Power movement, and instead focuses on the similarities between the two.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/eKrsTlOa3yQGsfPXn19gLQgaxL2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"O Happy Day: The Early Days of Black Gay Liberation","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2438180,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Lofton","original_name":"Charles Lofton","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dae3df9ae36680018d5a32a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0137134","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eKrsTlOa3yQGsfPXn19gLQgaxL2.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hcle0FXpFk5uZP4V76E1BBk3ZWN.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"San Francisco International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival","release_date":"1996-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
