Through the use of still photographs, archival footage and interviews, this documentary traces seven decades of MacLennan's public and private life--as a young boy in Nova Scotia, brought up in a strict Presbyterian family of Scottish descent, as a Rhodes scholar at Oxford, as a professor at McGill University, and as the author of seven novels and numerous essays. Also featured in the film are several readings from MacLennan's work.","popularity":0.2769,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hugh MacLennan: Portrait of a Writer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4922447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugh MacLennan","original_name":"Hugh MacLennan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"66d7f7c47666822ac19d7f16","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1586614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert A.
