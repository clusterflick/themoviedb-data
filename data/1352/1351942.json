With her excellent sense of taste and full of love that she got from her parents, she ran her restaurant for 45 years. Now retired at age 70, she welcomes only one group per day at her house to dine, with each dish she prepares having a story behind it. \"The experience is a luxury for my guests, and for me, too,\" said the woman affectionately known as \"Mama.\" \"I’ve had a fair share of hardships, but it would be fantastic if I could give back to my guests and make them happy. How long do I plan to continue working? For the rest of my life, of course. This is all I know how to do.” A love letter to the gift of thoughtful cooking, GIFTS FROM THE KITCHEN is a mouth-watering delight.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/dHRJdmP5iHv0M42WHAEPpZRAqhu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gifts from the Kitchen","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Kitchin kara hanataba wo","type":"romanization"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2392084,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kikuchi Hisashi","original_name":"Kikuchi Hisashi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d819389086cc277f26ec63","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":"fumin_movie"},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2628,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/dHRJdmP5iHv0M42WHAEPpZRAqhu.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1858}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hawai'i International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
