Totalling one hour and forty three minutes, Pringle demonstrates his impressive collection of theremins - Samuel Hoffman's RCA, Julius Goldberg's RCA, the Moog Ethervox Theremin, and the Moog Etherwave Theremin, describes and demonstrates impeccably a variety of theremin techniques, and even goes as far as demonstrating the MIDI capabilities of the Moog Ethervox.  Whether you are a beginner, a veteran thereminist, or simply interested in the history of the instrument and the development of the techniques and methods that have been devised to play it, this DVD will have something for you. With a total running time of 1 hour and 43 minutes, the disk features three instruments: the Samuel Hoffman 1929 RCA theremin, the Moog Music Ethervox, and the Moog Music Etherwave. This covers every sort of theremin from the rare vintage models to the modern 'entry level' instrument.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/tuLBQM3qmDmVi9coaHKDBCFgm1Z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How to Play the Theremin With Peter Pringle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2150,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tuLBQM3qmDmVi9coaHKDBCFgm1Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1433}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2004-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
