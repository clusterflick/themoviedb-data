A kind of summer diary where the younger sister Maria observes her bigger sister who lives in an unreachable realm of her own.  The film has a playful approach to its language and was inspired by the director’s younger brother Christian – who as a child made several little fragmented films while being bored during a summer in the country side.  A film about a secret language between sisters, the magic of small moments and naive self discovery.","popularity":0.139,"poster_path":"/hI1TgB9fgHV5mTmGlaDamINJIut.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":229615,"logo_path":null,"name":"Czar Film","origin_country":""},{"id":3846,"logo_path":"/vKfSLK0FIrebJoXwSrVIZyQjCVL.png","name":"Epoch Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":238098,"logo_path":null,"name":"BaconX","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2022-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Sister Lola","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4922248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Karlin Schauerte","original_name":"Sophie Karlin Schauerte","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Maria","credit_id":"66d7bc9f18fc37104926e06b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4922249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johanna Schauerte","original_name":"Johanna Schauerte","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Lola","credit_id":"66d7bcab44d359f12c4f3f12","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2187688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judith Seither","original_name":"Judith Seither","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Mom","credit_id":"66d7bcb4df474cf8778ef71c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1177070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Holger Daemgen","original_name":"Holger Daemgen","popularity":0.2656,"profile_path":"/aK9kLDMVZlf3KySoNxvu74n3FRD.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dad","credit_id":"66d7bcbf2ce26003358ef98c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2248456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klaus Bobach Rios","original_name":"Klaus Bobach Rios","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Boy","credit_id":"66d7bcc8123121307e6cdb6b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1159909,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin de Thurah","original_name":"Martin de Thurah","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d7bcdba6340e39739d7481","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1159909,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin de Thurah","original_name":"Martin de Thurah","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d7bce23376a503b6b8a754","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4438685,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Melissa Culligan","original_name":"Melissa Culligan","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d7bcf5867ff3c0ad60390d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4243591,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Julia Weber","original_name":"Julia Weber","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d7bd0aac2706568c9d7637","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64954,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mikkel E.G.
