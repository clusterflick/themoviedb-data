Against the backdrop of war and revolution, film developed to become the emerging Filipinos' dominant form of public entertainment. The documentary further explores the elements of Spanish culture found in Filipino films as evidenced through the classic films made by three National Artists - Eddie Romero, Lino Brocka, and Ishmael Bernal. This is Deocampo's homage both to Philippine cinema and the Filipino nation that is its twin.","popularity":0.0487,"poster_path":"/eQ44WgFMZlMp0KJhT70TxCWRycf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Documentary","title":"Cine/Sine: Spanish Beginnings of Philippine Cinema","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1289629,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Deocampo","original_name":"Nick Deocampo","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":"/27zXf6TFV6yZmD4ErPUcawWdUs1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"66d7ecb46c20fc93bd9d809c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1289629,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Deocampo","original_name":"Nick Deocampo","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":"/27zXf6TFV6yZmD4ErPUcawWdUs1.jpg","credit_id":"66d7f139258c3c400d182359","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1289629,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Deocampo","original_name":"Nick Deocampo","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":"/27zXf6TFV6yZmD4ErPUcawWdUs1.jpg","credit_id":"66d7f1450c711cc77429dfe7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eQ44WgFMZlMp0KJhT70TxCWRycf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
