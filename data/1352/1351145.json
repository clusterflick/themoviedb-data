Still, with striking animation and the moving piano notes of composer Wesley West, the silence in this movie is significantly meaningful.  Veteran actor Tobie Cronjé and newcomer Olwethu Kuene play the roles of Helmut and Bolelo, two neighbours who can’t stand each other, but who, through the universal language of music, assume unique roles in fulfilling each other’s lives.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Noise & Neighbours","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
