In 1961, with the launch of the First Five-Year Economic Development Plan, Korea initiated its family planning program as a measure to curb the population explosion. Intertwined with various social ambitions and desires, this initiative was deemed \"successful\" in reshaping society. Today, as we live with the outcomes of this all-out effort for growth, this film revisits the process of \"planning\" families to reflect on South Korea's future.​","popularity":0.0663,"poster_path":"/hMtztwSomRGVJRtMqVhBNQOeygP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154810,"logo_path":"/ptFmUmvS7aANRcmajNW249FGPMu.png","name":"KBS","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2024-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everybody had a plan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4922764,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Han Seok-gu","original_name":"Han Seok-gu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d82b71123121307e6ce781","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1621,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/hMtztwSomRGVJRtMqVhBNQOeygP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"ALL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DMZ International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2024-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
