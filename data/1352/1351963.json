She interrogates the fraught relationship between personal and public memory by revisiting, comparing and subverting how her late grandfather, Rasul Gamzatov (b.1923 - 2003), is remembered. In the work, Makhacheva’s childhood memories meet her adult remembrances and his public memorialisation, which the film subtly reveals are at odds with one another.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"AE","name":"United Arab Emirates"}],"release_date":"2024-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tsumikh","video":false,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4922714,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taus Makhacheva","original_name":"Taus Makhacheva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d82276c72b57a5434742ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2468424,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandra Pustynnova","original_name":"Alexandra Pustynnova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d82280deee6b67ca9d2ad3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DMZ International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2024-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
