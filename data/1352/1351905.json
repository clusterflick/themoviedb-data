With some players having to pay to play or access coaching, Wolves invited a group of players to the Golden Chance trial in Phoenix, Arizona to be able to scout en masse, footballers from a wide variety of backgrounds, who they typically wouldn't be able to pick up through traditional recruitment. In the second part of the trial, two of the most promising players were invited to be a part of our training camp to see how they matched up to the talent in a Premier League Academy. There will be further opportunities for players in America to get the Golden Chance, with talent spotted in Chicago and Arizona joining up with the Wolves squad in the upcoming TST tournament!","popularity":0.1284,"poster_path":"/iz49OdLqzyWDo3nvRqioTP4Pm8B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":238077,"logo_path":"/1NMgBRP5DCLj0YTzd5ybl4NOdlx.png","name":"Wolves Studios","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":238111,"logo_path":null,"name":"MediaHouse HD","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Finding the Next US Soccer Star","title":"Finding soccer talent in the USA to join up with Wolves Academy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4924357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Hunter-Barrett","original_name":"Jonathan Hunter-Barrett","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/gFpdQckTHCdYMhqkIxA0aNiuPHn.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"66d92db5cc1479a16029fcc8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4924358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Hunt","original_name":"Joe Hunt","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/rzCLBLT7Pre4USNyrBcmlhSpwKX.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"66d92e263ed64d469f29fd39","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4924356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Birtwistle","original_name":"Harry Birtwistle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/xzlRCNo7VsMfmXNedTUOq4LNRod.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"66d92d2644328a76b83c242c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4924360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Tipton","original_name":"Oliver Tipton","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/fx9ql51RduBXbv0kYXCXhqrnBFm.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"66d92f0e1bf0f83f3e8f247e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4924374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phillie Villapudua","original_name":"Phillie Villapudua","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/zCnngzNJtBhFoBBUYV5S0F4U4jv.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"66d93101779e1ff192bf6a3f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4924368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Beltran","original_name":"Tony Beltran","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/t0JCuoeB60DA34W9C8Gb17XMmOC.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"66d92ff6bcfa3188619d4e3b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3354322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raúl Jiménez","original_name":"Raúl Jiménez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/nSlSeAZ4viuEjeMPOuaqsnXWOnV.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"66d932449c75318b1c0f024d","order":6}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1KPB4FWKR3vO1ln2sknnBy0TNYz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1922}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":767,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iz49OdLqzyWDo3nvRqioTP4Pm8B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":511}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":13042,"name":"football (soccer)"},{"id":159290,"name":"sports documentary"},{"id":289349,"name":"wolverhampton wanderers"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
