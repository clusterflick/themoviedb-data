Although these bases are designated for Japan's Self-Defense Forces rather than the U.S. military, they pose an equal threat to the islanders, instilling fear of war and contributing to the destruction of their communities and way of life. In Okinawa, where parallels can be drawn to the THAAD system in Soseong-ri, South Korea, and the naval base in Gangjeong, Jeju Island, I met with individuals who are courageously speaking out against the prospect of war.","popularity":0.0592,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2024-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Side by side","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4922746,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Seol-hae","original_name":"Kim Seol-hae","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d8292244d359f12c4f4c69","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4922748,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeong Jong-min","original_name":"Jeong Jong-min","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d8293b7c0617822a3c09ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DMZ International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2024-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"나란한 섬 Side by side│기획전 Focus│16TH DMZ Docs Trailer","key":"GMMrQlRXFtE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-09-04T07:30:05.000Z","id":"6730c04d3c104d88bdc5c085"}]}}}
