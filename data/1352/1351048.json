The gathering, four days dedicated to counterculture and pop music, was attended by students, young people, workers, lumpenproletarians, feminists, gays and young people from extra-parliamentary groups. The memories and testimonies of those who organized, sang or simply participated will be a commentary on the splendid images of the time. For the first time, meaning is given to the exclusive and complete material shot by Alberto Grifi and six other operators at Parco Lambro in 1976.","popularity":0.1124,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nudi Verso la Follia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Festival di Parco Lambro 1976 -
