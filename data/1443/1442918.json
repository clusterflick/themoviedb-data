As she searches for the truth about her long-deceased Bulgarian father, Daphne clashes with her eccentric local cousin Orlin, who is eager to rid her of the supposedly worthless property—while keeping secret the unique mineral spring flowing beneath it. Unraveling the dramatic history of her father’s lineage, still alive in the memories of the village elders, Daphne discovers an unexpected opportunity to rediscover herself.","popularity":0.232,"poster_path":"/mJrJSzrLP8MiCtBjPVKE29QCQ5Q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"}],"release_date":"2025-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български
