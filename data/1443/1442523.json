Inspired by NWFC's 40 second movies project, this is exactly 40 seconds long, 960 frames of picture. The variations in grid square size is the result of the Moviola's metal footpedal being worn down in the editing of countless movies. This evidence of millions of miles of film footage, lovingly cut by scores of editors is recast upon wings of light via crotchety projection contraptions in wishing NWFC all the best for the next 40 years.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"40.mov","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5280404,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Devon Damonte","original_name":"Devon Damonte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c5a667564d2575d9920f81","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"40.mov","key":"36649017","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2012-02-12T18:34:30.000Z","id":"67c7fbc2d7419cdfd86e23ef"}]}}}
