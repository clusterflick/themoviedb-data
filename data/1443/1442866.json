The birthplace of \"father of the atom\" Ernest Rutherford willingly participated in British tests at Christmas Island in the 1950s (and looked eagerly for uranium in the Buller Gorge). But as testing increased in the Pacific, Prime Ministers Holyoake, Kirk and Lange voiced opposition. Moruroa, nuclear ship visit protests and the Rainbow Warrior bombing fuelled the anti-nuclear cause.","popularity":0.1252,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nuclear Reaction","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Mune","original_name":"Ian Mune","popularity":0.1778,"profile_path":"/8MO8QjpoKWr2I6gSx5MQJgtP6su.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"67c675b9598e21304a04d473","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1651877,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alan Erson","original_name":"Alan Erson","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c674c00228ae313204d524","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1363613,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"George Andrews","original_name":"George Andrews","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c674dd644eec7114c073fd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":144882,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Chris Burt","original_name":"Chris Burt","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c674ed9eba0c609ac07125","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1775562,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tim Woodhouse","original_name":"Tim Woodhouse","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c6756c9eba0c609ac07140","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
