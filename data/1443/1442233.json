Named for (and to) artist Carolyn Lazard, the video features open captions synced to a slowed and languorous reading of each score. The video’s open captions appear across a detail image of the artwork \"Consumed Grounds\" (2015) by Jessica Vaughn. Made primarily of asphalt, \"Consumed Grounds\"’s glittery surface fills the video’s visual field.","popularity":0.1636,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SCORES FOR CAROLYN","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5279300,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Park McArthur","original_name":"Park McArthur","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c49b0d8ac38c7b854e4e85","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5279301,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Constantina Zavitsanos","original_name":"Constantina Zavitsanos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c49b297053b95a73b4b555","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":162735,"name":"disability"},{"id":203672,"name":"care"},{"id":343507,"name":"sound art"},{"id":347977,"name":"nobody promised you tomorrow"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
