On her own words about the film \"I had unfortunately fallen in love and had my heart broken, and somehow I thought I could make a film about that internal state, which, at eighteen years old, you can't! I had no idea what I was doing. I had a would-be actress, and she changed her hair in the middle of the shoot and didn't understand why that mattered. I didn't know how to direct actors. I never really understood coverage so everything I filmed was a long shot. I didn't even know you were supposed to move the camera. And then when I started to edit [the film], it was impossible. It was really upsetting.\"","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Bed of Roses","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5146310,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peri Muldofsky","original_name":"Peri Muldofsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c6e7bd51cd5e32f1c08b2d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
