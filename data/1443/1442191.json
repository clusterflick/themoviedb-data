In the magical story about the friendship between a courageous nautical child and a mermaid boy, everyone is special. The unique costumes, dark visual effects and compelling music are a feast for fans of Tim Burton, Lemony Snicket and... Lampie herself of course!  Lampie lives with her father Augustus in the lighthouse. He sends her up every evening to light the torch. One tempestuous day, everything goes  wrong: the matches run out, the fire fails and a large ship crashes against the rocks. Lampie is sent away from home and has to go to work in the infamous Black House, where, as everyone knows, a monster lives.  This is the movie version of a four part TV series with the same title.","popularity":0.427,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2025-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Super atmospheric film adaptation of the acclaimed children's book by Annette Schaap, which quickly became a worldwide classic.","title":"Lampie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3798568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lotte Jonker","original_name":"Lotte Jonker","popularity":0.0952,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Lampje","credit_id":"67c48aab8ac38c7b854e4729","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Els Dottermans","original_name":"Els Dottermans","popularity":0.2078,"profile_path":"/9NmzTbq4Nhwg1HCBX02NksMmAGp.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Martha","credit_id":"67c48abd6466bd8ed24e3143","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145587,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gijs Naber","original_name":"Gijs Naber","popularity":0.2659,"profile_path":"/8Ky6ITtOUsyHgplHnDguZQMPto1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Augustus","credit_id":"67c48acd7053b95a73b4aa03","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1388538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meral Polat","original_name":"Meral Polat","popularity":0.2435,"profile_path":"/6VD0yOQ6ujaaWZIUKpDDbQ1a5ti.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Emilia","credit_id":"67c48ae7a5e1e358c44b249d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":27836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leny Breederveld","original_name":"Leny Breederveld","popularity":0.304,"profile_path":"/wBELV4OuiPdShZNcRa7GLEQddQN.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mevrouw Rozenhout","credit_id":"67c48b138ac38c7b854e4766","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1193749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabri Saad El-Hamus","original_name":"Sabri Saad El-Hamus","popularity":0.2559,"profile_path":"/cyTiTd5ERPQsLWyPYug8Q7oocm7.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mijnheer Rozenhout","credit_id":"67c48b2aab4da0b0d5b4af32","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1137361,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabian Jansen","original_name":"Fabian Jansen","popularity":0.173,"profile_path":"/sbhBGCuBFPD6EVSaipx5iFP2lQY.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Flint","credit_id":"67c48b478bd7ecb12b4b28ee","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3798572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manu Gunning","original_name":"Manu Gunning","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Vis","credit_id":"67c48b6c49bb8758bab49eb3","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1007643,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margien Rogaar","original_name":"Margien Rogaar","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c48b8fab4da0b0d5b4afa5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":83464,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mieke de Jong","original_name":"Mieke de Jong","popularity":0.1524,"profile_path":"/m1yNQr8d39RrXYje9A7DldG5KlN.jpg","credit_id":"67c48baea5e1e358c44b24f3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3205,"name":"fairy tale"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"9","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"festival (Jeugdfilmfestival)","release_date":"2025-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
