In the centre is displayed a native altar of worship. The high priest enters, and at his command enter two native slaves, whom he commands to remove the pedestal in the centre of the alter. In its place he places an urn; with a few mysterious passes he causes flames to issue forth, to the consternation of his servants. He then throws a magic powder into the flames, and there appears, after the explosion, a beautiful vision of Siva the Invisible, who mysteriously ascends to the centre of the altar; and, before they can admire her beauty, she fades away into space. Not to be outdone, the priest makes a few more passes, and gradually there appears in the place of Siva a Hindoo princess. Both the priest and the servants fall on their knees to worship her. She immediately takes her place on the pedestal, and to the alarm of all turns to the stone statue of Buddah, the Hindoo God. They flee in terror.\"","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":45867,"logo_path":null,"name":"Star Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1904-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Invisible Siva","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Invisible Sylvia","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"La invisible Siva","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Méliès","original_name":"Georges Méliès","popularity":0.2169,"profile_path":"/acx5saf22Qj6FV5WAsacRHlZAMn.jpg","credit_id":"67c49a5304b6b222cf4e2bbc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0228864","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1904-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
