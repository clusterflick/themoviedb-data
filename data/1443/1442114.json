It features one of the most dramatically rewarding bass-baritone roles: a noble ruler who loves his children and his people, but whose thirst for power has led him to commit a terrible crime. Bryn Terfel is “a powerful new Boris” (The Observer) in Richard Jones’ new production of the original 1869 score. Antonio Pappano conducts an outstanding cast that also includes John Graham-Hall as the crafty Prince Shuisky and John Tomlinson as the vagabond monk Varlaam.","popularity":0.1114,"poster_path":"/yGvNiD1lVtVCfxQxQ6aBl7woktm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mussorgsky: Boris Godunov (The Royal Opera House)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1089261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryn Terfel","original_name":"Bryn Terfel","popularity":0.3734,"profile_path":"/7p8Mc0xuEARbPzWXQvrCl5oIR4T.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Boris Godunov","credit_id":"67c460fe8ac38c7b854e3926","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2153003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ain Anger","original_name":"Ain Anger","popularity":0.0805,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Pimen","credit_id":"67c46148111cdd4ed8b4a9a0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1558918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Butt Philip","original_name":"David Butt Philip","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Grigory Otrepiev","credit_id":"67c461928ac38c7b854e395a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1570652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Graham-Hall","original_name":"John Graham-Hall","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/uZdyYeaeHb6JNWVBdHFJ4HljyN2.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Prince Shuisky","credit_id":"67c4621e89afff9e324e2933","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kostas Smoriginas","original_name":"Kostas Smoriginas","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Andrei Shchelkalov","credit_id":"67c462338bd7ecb12b4b1e38","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy White","original_name":"Jeremy White","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Nikitich","credit_id":"67c46247ab4da0b0d5b4a1ae","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1683799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vlada Borovko","original_name":"Vlada Borovko","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Xenia","credit_id":"67c4625a111cdd4ed8b4aa13","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006168,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antonio Pappano","original_name":"Antonio Pappano","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/sUQ9lJlOJVBXm1DtWaqNaxUyOIa.jpg","credit_id":"67c4626c111cdd4ed8b4aa1a","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437954,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Jones","original_name":"Richard Jones","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c46280defa42aa0f4b0bcb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70650,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Modeste Moussorgsky","original_name":"Modeste Moussorgsky","popularity":0.071,"profile_path":"/80ysKl0MqarVD8G3gEEujncqIii.jpg","credit_id":"67c46297defa42aa0f4b0bda","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yGvNiD1lVtVCfxQxQ6aBl7woktm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
