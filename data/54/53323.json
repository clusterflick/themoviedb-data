A pacifist, internationalist and utopian idealist, Kahn decided to use his private fortune to improve understanding between the nations of the world. To this end, he created what he called his Archive of the Planet. For the next two decades, he dispatched professional photographers to document the everyday lives of people in more than 50 countries all around the world. Kahn's wealth enabled him to supply his photographers with the most advanced camera technology available. They used the autochrome - the first user-friendly camera system capable of producing true-colour photographs.","popularity":0.2526,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2009-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Japan in Colour - The Wonderful World of Albert Kahn","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1389372,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Veronika Hyks","original_name":"Veronika Hyks","popularity":0.0633,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self - Narrator","credit_id":"5f3afc781fb94f0035abc987","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1206609,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fiona Cushley","original_name":"Fiona Cushley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe485fc3a36847f816402d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2155317","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":233,"name":"japan"},{"id":6025,"name":"photography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
