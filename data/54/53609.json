There he meets Lynn O'Malley, the niece of Sandy McTavish who runs the trading post. Lee learns the reason why this is good trapping country is because the timber barons across the lake are ruthlessly cutting the trees and driving the animals across the river. The trappers appeal to him to take a petition to the Governor which would prohibit the timber people from coming to their side of the lake. At first, because he is a wanted man, he refuses but does so later for the sake of the people even though he knows it will lead to his arrest.","popularity":0.7469,"poster_path":"/yaHFfIJExqB6E4wlE7tG6iaucDk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88863,"logo_path":null,"name":"Action Pictures (II)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1946-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The law said he had killed a man!","title":"God's Country","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Lowery","original_name":"Robert Lowery","popularity":0.1636,"profile_path":"/8wS1z1Di0lHQBHu6zOA75SUtJGN.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"Lee Preston / Leland Bruce","credit_id":"52fe4872c3a36847f8167387","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":133340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Gilbert","original_name":"Helen Gilbert","popularity":0.1117,"profile_path":"/pzf4gW06Fjl3Acli6CmXXGm1T6N.jpg","cast_id":1004,"character":"Lynn O'Malley / McTavish","credit_id":"52fe4872c3a36847f816738b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Farnum","original_name":"William Farnum","popularity":0.1903,"profile_path":"/a2N7jJoXYLHaUFBDMGMuIgqja60.jpg","cast_id":1005,"character":"Sandy McTavish","credit_id":"52fe4872c3a36847f816738f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Buster Keaton","original_name":"Buster Keaton","popularity":1.3068,"profile_path":"/ejJz8YWn1Dr1PFn6E70NZ0oZ6o6.jpg","cast_id":1006,"character":"Old Tarp / Mr. Boone","credit_id":"52fe4872c3a36847f8167393","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89736,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Si Jenks","original_name":"Si Jenks","popularity":0.0958,"profile_path":"/cYuYnEjgpPvUMiphroFhI0PgGkB.jpg","cast_id":1007,"character":"Timber Cross","credit_id":"52fe4872c3a36847f8167397","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stanley Andrews","original_name":"Stanley Andrews","popularity":0.4338,"profile_path":"/zAW09eb1f0g4OPtNkJk83ej1os5.jpg","cast_id":1008,"character":"Howard King","credit_id":"52fe4872c3a36847f816739b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al Ferguson","original_name":"Al Ferguson","popularity":0.1887,"profile_path":"/pqsu8OuPrGPMwuvvPsL1cVMzEMr.jpg","cast_id":1009,"character":"'Turk' Monroe","credit_id":"58f5402d925141276d003cfd","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trevor Bardette","original_name":"Trevor Bardette","popularity":0.4223,"profile_path":"/2UMCLFs7YmM5031cKZvA3C4q7zw.jpg","cast_id":1010,"character":"White Cloud","credit_id":"58f5403b92514127a6003a97","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1378275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Estelita Zarco","original_name":"Estelita Zarco","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1011,"character":"River Squaw (as Estelle Zarco)","credit_id":"58f5404992514127b80037f9","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148572,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frances Kavanaugh","original_name":"Frances Kavanaugh","popularity":0.0499,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4872c3a36847f8167383","department":"Writing","job":"Adaptation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148571,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert Emmett Tansey","original_name":"Robert Emmett Tansey","popularity":0.2353,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4872c3a36847f8167377","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24426,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Oliver Curwood","original_name":"James Oliver Curwood","popularity":0.1485,"profile_path":"/8hhzku4GGUdcsOVrydWrtcFr6NW.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4872c3a36847f816737d","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1584402,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Carl Wester","original_name":"Carl Wester","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebc5fcd614c6d001d90526f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1410468,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"William B.
