One day, however, they discover that their treasured Kind Bud is missing. Someone has stolen it and left a clue as to the whereabouts of their stash: a photo of some strangely familiar mountains. Whomever it was, Kyle and Dan vow to find them and make them pay. So they begin a journey filled with assumption, deception and consumption. Locating the missing weed, however, is complicated by the fact that Kyle and Dan have completely burned out their short-term memories. What is said or done right now is of little consequence, because in a few minutes they won't remember a damn thing.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Some memories are just too hard to remember.","title":"Hempmento","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":147653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Kosloski","original_name":"Jeff Kosloski","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Kyle","credit_id":"52fe485cc3a36847f8163683","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":147660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Rosenhagen","original_name":"Lisa Rosenhagen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Patty","credit_id":"52fe485cc3a36847f8163687","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":147655,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kirk Edward Anderson","original_name":"Kirk Edward Anderson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Pizza Guy","credit_id":"52fe485cc3a36847f816369d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1081139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael O'Shea","original_name":"Michael O'Shea","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Dan","credit_id":"52fe485cc3a36847f81636b9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1081140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Shirley","original_name":"Dave Shirley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Landlord","credit_id":"52fe485cc3a36847f81636bd","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":215139,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Mike Ackerman","original_name":"Mike Ackerman","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe485cc3a36847f81636d5","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":147658,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brad Stabio","original_name":"Brad Stabio","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe485cc3a36847f81636cf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":147652,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Brook Aitken","original_name":"Brook Aitken","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe485cc3a36847f81636a9","department":"Crew","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":147653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Kosloski","original_name":"Jeff Kosloski","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe485cc3a36847f81636c3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":147662,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lowel Pierce","original_name":"Lowel Pierce","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe485cc3a36847f81636a3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":147658,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brad Stabio","original_name":"Brad Stabio","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe485cc3a36847f816368d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":147658,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brad Stabio","original_name":"Brad Stabio","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe485cc3a36847f8163693","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":147655,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kirk Edward Anderson","original_name":"Kirk Edward Anderson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe485cc3a36847f81636c9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":147653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Kosloski","original_name":"Jeff Kosloski","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe485cc3a36847f8163699","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":147655,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kirk Edward Anderson","original_name":"Kirk Edward Anderson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe485cc3a36847f81636b5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":147652,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Brook Aitken","original_name":"Brook Aitken","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe485cc3a36847f81636af","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0433389","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
