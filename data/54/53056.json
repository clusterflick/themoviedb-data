Deep in the heart of Transylvania, a mighty Extreme Enduro race exists. It's called the Red Bull Romaniacs Hard Enduro Rallye and it is pure madness on a dirtbike. Each year, competitors from over 20 nations descend upon the city of Sibui to experience five days of hell on two wheels. You have never seen racing until you see this. The Mystique of the Carpathians! The countryside of Romania offers riding like nowhere else in the world. Wide open flowing trails, steep mountain hillclimbs, rushing rivers and routes through secluded Romanian villages. But this race is a true test of physical endurance and the will to finish something incredibly difficult. It's all or nothing.
