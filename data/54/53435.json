A photographer snaps a shot of one thief as he is carrying the bank building's blueprints. The would-be thief then begins a relationship with the photographer and attempts to retrieve the photos. Meanwhile, the thieves' plot consists of this: one man will enter the bank building after dark, while the other man sits in a van and uses a computer to unlock the building's doors. The final step involves transporting the cash to a freight ship waiting on the docks, for transportation to a money launderer in Macau.","popularity":2.2723,"poster_path":"/ydiUyQ8XqhPrOWjA2iHlmh8Abpz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71153,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bennettfilms
