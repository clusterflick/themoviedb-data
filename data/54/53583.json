When they hear on the radio that the police are looking for them, they dump the car and hide out near a farmhouse. But the farmer's radio also broadcasts the couple's description, so they run away and start hitchhiking, only to be picked up by two policemen. They manage to flee into a railroad yard and hop a train that turns out to be refrigerated. Finally they decide to turn themselves in -- just as they learn that the real crooks have been apprehended.","popularity":0.376,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1935-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The E-Flat Man","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Buster Keaton","original_name":"Buster Keaton","popularity":1.3068,"profile_path":"/ejJz8YWn1Dr1PFn6E70NZ0oZ6o6.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Elmer","credit_id":"52fe4870c3a36847f8166de9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothea Kent","original_name":"Dorothea Kent","popularity":0.1958,"profile_path":"/y5utXdRZ8MAjrDDgVJS5nyJp6uq.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Elmer's Girl","credit_id":"52fe4870c3a36847f8166ded","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Broderick O'Farrell","original_name":"Broderick O'Farrell","popularity":0.089,"profile_path":"/jQRXAuy5Lr0HwlmsYwVmHx8nRmN.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mr. Reynolds","credit_id":"52fe4870c3a36847f8166df1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89736,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Si Jenks","original_name":"Si Jenks","popularity":0.0958,"profile_path":"/cYuYnEjgpPvUMiphroFhI0PgGkB.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Farmer","credit_id":"52fe4870c3a36847f8166df5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":88999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fern Emmett","original_name":"Fern Emmett","popularity":0.1801,"profile_path":"/3P5MeVW4rqoRn8TG7NlQuP2Zjnb.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Farmer's Wife","credit_id":"52fe4870c3a36847f8166df9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles McAvoy","original_name":"Charles McAvoy","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"67efca3aaa77e08af799402f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Shutta","original_name":"Jack Shutta","popularity":0.0809,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"67efca46931ce174a2d93ff0","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138220,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Betz","original_name":"Matthew Betz","popularity":0.1197,"profile_path":"/tpGMjJrquUADwkV8ZXJLofwNy8d.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Hood with Toothache (uncredited)","credit_id":"67efca550c791beb57acf918","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bud Jamison","original_name":"Bud Jamison","popularity":0.1662,"profile_path":"/AiiqQpcsDraQqYxkKwwKHmCU0QE.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Cop (uncredited)","credit_id":"67efca62aa77e08af799403d","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29627,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Lamont","original_name":"Charles Lamont","popularity":0.2233,"profile_path":"/8qfNBax66dI9pU5qnHCU1tQfLiR.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4870c3a36847f8166de5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29627,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Lamont","original_name":"Charles Lamont","popularity":0.2233,"profile_path":"/8qfNBax66dI9pU5qnHCU1tQfLiR.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4870c3a36847f8166dd9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148519,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Glen Lambert","original_name":"Glen Lambert","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4870c3a36847f8166ddf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1172467,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"E.H.
