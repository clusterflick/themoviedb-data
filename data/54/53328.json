It is a battle over protecting our health and environment from the destructive power of Big Coal. Mining and burning coal is at the epicenter of America's struggle to balance its energy needs with environmental and health concerns. Nowhere is that concern greater than in Coal River Valley, West Virginia, where a small but passionate group of ordinary citizens are trying to stop Big Coal corporations, like Massey Energy, from continuing the devastating practice of Mountain Top Removal.","popularity":0.6226,"poster_path":"/3RpbelASwAWlL5DX2jFNsKkT6r7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3926,"logo_path":"/5nzgUGtsq0ebgtXYiCCIx59Zufd.png","name":"Uncommon Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-06-03","revenue":90425,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Fight For Our Future","title":"The Last Mountain","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert F.
