Unbeknownst to him, the letter is about a rendezvous with her own lover at their \"trysting place\".  Elsewhere, after some domestic frustration, Charlie runs an errand to buy a baby bottle before stopping at the same restaurant. After a confrontation there, they both inadvertently leave with each other's coats. Later, their wives independently discover what appears to be incriminating evidence of extramarital affairs from the pockets of the swapped garments. It all comes to a head when all four of them find themselves at the \"trysting place\" in the park.","popularity":0.5283,"poster_path":"/8Nf3uVAIbW9lry0i917qRsdv9Ex.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4148,"logo_path":null,"name":"Keystone Film Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"His Trysting Places","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":46,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Charlot se engaña","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Il luogo del convegno","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Charlot papà","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"たにんのがいとう","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"逢引きの場所","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"他人のコート","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Female Comedies -
