Mostly shot on freight trips across the western US, the film includes interviews with some of the railroad’s greatest graffiti legends: Colossus of Roads, The Rambler, Herby (RIP) and the granddaddy of them all, Bozo Texino. The film also catches some of the socio-economic history of hobo subculture from its roots after the Civil War to the present day. The range of the interviews, and the film’s style deal with both the clichés and the harsh realities of tramp life.","popularity":0.2339,"poster_path":"/tsAK8WpMAiC3XGYdaWdaFYArByR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Secret History of Hobo Graffiti","title":"Who Is Bozo Texino?","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":84453,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bill Daniel","original_name":"Bill Daniel","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe487fc3a36847f816a327","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":576,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lee Daniel","original_name":"Lee Daniel","popularity":0.1467,"profile_path":"/bvVz3qLqMyZVyBXO6z0z4Grubq9.jpg","credit_id":"64f6295112197e00fea96d13","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":84453,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bill Daniel","original_name":"Bill Daniel","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f62aadebb99d00ae05dd5f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1975847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Kerr","original_name":"Tim Kerr","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f62a03e0ca7f00ae3b49d2","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":84453,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bill Daniel","original_name":"Bill Daniel","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f62aa75f2b8d0139cf4d95","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2987966","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":1250,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tsAK8WpMAiC3XGYdaWdaFYArByR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":840},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oZ6GCwP625YYprUwC3OSYAxZg6z.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7bPTecMNwQ84vPDpJk5Dm0YyJn9.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1700,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/d8qUZo7bZLy8SXnf9u9HzWSolYm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1134}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2448,"name":"freight train"},{"id":309928,"name":"boxcar"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
