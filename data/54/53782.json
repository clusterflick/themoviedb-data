Eventually he grows tired of her insults and flees to England when Louis XV insists that the two marry. He goes undercover as Monsieur Beaucaire, the barber of the French Ambassador, and finds that he enjoys the freedom of a commoner’s life. After catching the Duke of Winterset cheating at cards, he forces him to introduce him as a nobleman to Lady Mary, with whom he has become infatuated. When Lady Mary is led to believe that the Duke of Chartres is merely a barber she loses interest in him. She eventually learns that he is a nobleman after all and tries to win him back, but the Duke of Chartres opts to return to France and Princess Henriette who now returns his affection.","popularity":0.3518,"poster_path":"/us5K7YE4BSqVPqPy6uFXT2odMQ2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1924-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Never Has Valentino Been Such a Lover, Such a Dancer, Such a Swordsman, Such a Dashing, Handsome, Lovable Hero as You'll See Him in This Master Photoplay","title":"Monsieur Beaucaire","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolph Valentino","original_name":"Rudolph Valentino","popularity":0.3549,"profile_path":"/hz1ts5wreDNjCcnfiIDWIcWpu3y.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"Duke de Chartres / Beaucaire","credit_id":"52fe487bc3a36847f81692ed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bebe Daniels","original_name":"Bebe Daniels","popularity":0.2266,"profile_path":"/5vZGoSlVqUXFxilSEeApppLAfLL.jpg","cast_id":1004,"character":"Princess Henriette","credit_id":"52fe487bc3a36847f81692f1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lois Wilson","original_name":"Lois Wilson","popularity":0.1411,"profile_path":"/fSQS8avO1WLCdD8BfDuwEtLLsCa.jpg","cast_id":1005,"character":"Queen Marie of France","credit_id":"52fe487bc3a36847f81692f5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148837,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doris Kenyon","original_name":"Doris Kenyon","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":"/laM51FLnMQbtaSiAZYyUpd4ZRB7.jpg","cast_id":1006,"character":"Lady Mary","credit_id":"52fe487bc3a36847f81692f9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lowell Sherman","original_name":"Lowell Sherman","popularity":0.2272,"profile_path":"/u1lNvBuApEu7eY3l3MhpoQZN6gf.jpg","cast_id":1007,"character":"King Louis XV of France","credit_id":"52fe487bc3a36847f81692fd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paulette Duval","original_name":"Paulette Duval","popularity":0.1599,"profile_path":"/qfnNwcOv6Jj4fy9pxbBQexRnUze.jpg","cast_id":1008,"character":"Madame Pompadour","credit_id":"52fe487bc3a36847f8169301","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Davidson","original_name":"John Davidson","popularity":0.1091,"profile_path":"/bfM1Hzm6nPoTY8cm4mafA8ycpkf.jpg","cast_id":1012,"character":"Richelieu","credit_id":"60f5749853866e005dbbfbf9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3163512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oswald Yorke","original_name":"Oswald Yorke","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1013,"character":"Miropoix","credit_id":"60f574a6f90b19002d1ab8ac","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":998697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flora Finch","original_name":"Flora Finch","popularity":0.1535,"profile_path":"/r1Af5GrRy6uKDRwsWTxrsitpmIy.jpg","cast_id":1014,"character":"Duchesse de Montmorency","credit_id":"60f574b68258fc00458898f9","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3163513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Waller","original_name":"Louis Waller","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1015,"character":"François","credit_id":"60f574c653866e0046674e96","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Maclaren","original_name":"Ian Maclaren","popularity":0.0855,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1016,"character":"Duke of Winterset","credit_id":"60f574d7f90b19004563a884","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Shannon","original_name":"Frank Shannon","popularity":0.0827,"profile_path":"/aRBY351YHoCKwrTknhDwwNmpCeF.jpg","cast_id":1017,"character":"Badger","credit_id":"60f574e733a533005f764e9d","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1760332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Templar Powell","original_name":"Templar Powell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/2f1oyEIR7Oz5EEKllPVo8atROFw.jpg","cast_id":1018,"character":"Molyneux","credit_id":"60f574f55545ca007c91fefc","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1383207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"H.
