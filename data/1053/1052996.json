Rock's own megalomania gained a hitherto unimaginable amplitude, represented by bands like Queen, Genesis, Supertramp, Doobie Brothers and more recent ones, already within the 80s, like The Police. It was when rock had to be \"super\" to overcome fashions like punk or discoth√®que, then on the rise. This DVD records performances by several of these bands, offering rare footage of groups on the Top Pop TV show, or in promotional video clips.","popularity":0.1241,"poster_path":"/bYFbfXlSmUrBYCl1RIDoA0mHkSf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":186999,"logo_path":null,"name":"DEJ Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":8487,"logo_path":"/bXWVZmW3RD6SAk0lFahPxNbp541.png","name":"Sanrio","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":15163,"logo_path":"/75gxbqZaUTVrIqRSAhCmWSCgH2w.png","name":"AVRO","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Supergroups","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Bowie","original_name":"David Bowie","popularity":0.9542,"profile_path":"/qrqQJivS0zLzxZKfgNZnDtjbqpI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"637fddd8a410c800d00aaf76","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1809802,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Denis deVallance","original_name":"Denis deVallance","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637fdecf229ae2155c5205f0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":998473,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Strathford Hamilton","original_name":"Strathford Hamilton","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637fdee6a4af8f0086611a4f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3801356,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jim Meechan","original_name":"Jim Meechan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637fdefe85b10500977ba808","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1809803,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lyn Henderson","original_name":"Lyn Henderson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637fdf126e938a0084048e67","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1812921,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Robin Parsons","original_name":"Robin Parsons","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637fdf296e938a00a0eb42b6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5913884","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bYFbfXlSmUrBYCl1RIDoA0mHkSf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
