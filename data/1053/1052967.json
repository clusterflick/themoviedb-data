In 2015, Khalil Abu-Rayyan was just a young Muslim man in Detroit, Michigan: to get by, he delivered food for his family's pizzeria. Depressed and lonely, Khalil found solace in smoking weed and looking at extremist material online. Then two young women started messaging him, and he fell in love. But one of them suggested he start doing increasingly violent things. Nothing was as it seemed. And Khalil's life would never be the same.  A documentary by Garret Harkawik for the Gravel Institute.","popularity":0.4967,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"I Was a Lonely Pizza Guy.
