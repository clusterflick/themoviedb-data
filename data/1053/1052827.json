I really wanted to express my feelings about traveling in a way that the viewer could feel too what I felt and hopefully even get inspired to do some travelling for themselves. By sharing my story, I want others to feel like they got some value out of it - to either get to know me better, or recognize themselves in it, or even feel inspired to go out and do what they love.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Are you infected by the Travel Bug?","title":"The Travel Bug","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
