Somehow, the omniscient host manages to dissect the events and mechanisms, from Lucien’s family background to his innermost thoughts, that gave rise to Lucien’s sexual orientation, earliest homosexual fantasies, and first meetings with lovers. This film, an autofiction, plays with the conventions of the social sciences to map a geography of the intimate, a sociology of desire.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/l2tHi7lPcL6WOTmFBsm62gFE9u7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What if you could become the TV presenter of your own life?","title":"Éperlecques","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3798727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucien Fradin","original_name":"Lucien Fradin","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Le présentateur / Lucien","credit_id":"637d461a2790bf00cffe88b4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2574023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bénédicte Alloing","original_name":"Bénédicte Alloing","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637d46512790bf00b6f52cd2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3798727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucien Fradin","original_name":"Lucien Fradin","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637d46327d41aa0093a7c964","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fys2ao4YVUlfyhB4u8kn4Yb2rFk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/l2tHi7lPcL6WOTmFBsm62gFE9u7.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":530},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/qtnlH1S7IjefEB80lgqq0xVwG5M.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
