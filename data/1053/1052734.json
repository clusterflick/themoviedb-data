He did not know his father and his mother is no longer there. Paul finds one day the missing person report of a young girl. He goes to Inspector Holler and claims that he knows the girl. But in the course of the conversation, Paul always seems less credible. He is sent out by the inspector. Does Paul actually have anything to do with the missing girl or does he seek recognition in a lost world? When he meets young Ingrid and falls in love with her, the story turns in an uncontrollable and surprising direction. The film \"Paul Keller - Silence in Scream\" is produced by Frame Store Film and Entertainment GmbH on 16mm film. Director Axel Loh focuses on the \"old school\" look in the style of the 50s films. For this reason, he uses Beaulieau R16 series cameras from the '60s, which exactly reflect the look of this time. In addition, old footage is used, which shows street scenes and ruins of the post-war period.","popularity":0.0675,"poster_path":"/wMCo2Lv4d3OJcD4FwT1JMUWjnnl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paul Keller - Stille im Schrei","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3800272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Axel Loh","original_name":"Axel Loh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"637ed834a3d027008617f4d9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3800273,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chiara Andes","original_name":"Chiara Andes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"637ed83bc9dbf9007bb1fc0e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2191821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernd Wöllmer","original_name":"Bernd Wöllmer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6424c4efa3e4ba00b4225aee","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2703032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Axel Loh","original_name":"Axel Loh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637ed81a6e938a007ffec888","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10121222","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wMCo2Lv4d3OJcD4FwT1JMUWjnnl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
