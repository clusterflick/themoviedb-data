When Jack and Kate are walking along a Kent beach to meet friends and watch England play, they are confronted by Maryam, a refugee who has braved crossing the English Channel while heavily pregnant. Jack is faced with the decision to break with this paradigm and Kateâ€™s more extreme nationalism by finding his inner shared humanity with Maryam. Will he stand up for someone who needs help at the cost of that which is most dear to him?","popularity":0.0331,"poster_path":"/yRefSLCEQxdYPLpZsHZPWsQwOWw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kingsdown","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3798123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorien Tear","original_name":"Lorien Tear","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Kate","credit_id":"637ccd7bbb260200e3da86ae","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3798124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elouise Warboys","original_name":"Elouise Warboys","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Maryam","credit_id":"637ccd9707faa200e3e69601","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3798121,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eliza Riley","original_name":"Eliza Riley","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637ccd68176a94090efb6283","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yRefSLCEQxdYPLpZsHZPWsQwOWw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Ealing Film Festival 2022","release_date":"2022-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
