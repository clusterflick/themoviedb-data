The film uses stop motion, combining textile-based models with natural materials. The ever-changing yet repetitive emotions are explored along the journey where filmic atmosphere and sound shifts mood. The majority of the film features a large handmade set, with other scenes shot on a multi-plane. I made this film in response to the death of a very close friend and I hope my film can provide a sense of comfort to others experiencing similar feelings.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/3bQiZwAzAtQEhLVGHk57lcu91Pc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Edge of Grief","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3798593,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Faye Isherwood-Wallace","original_name":"Faye Isherwood-Wallace","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637d268275f1ad00df58f40f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3bQiZwAzAtQEhLVGHk57lcu91Pc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
