Through intimate and quiet scenes, we explore Joesy's complex relationship with Haru. The two respect one another, because at different times, both have felt like outsiders in the U.S. - Joesy as an undocumented immigrant who fears she could be sent back to Fiji, and Haru as a Japanese American who was sent to the internment camps during World War II.","popularity":0.0783,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Caretaker","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1292126,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kate McLean","original_name":"Kate McLean","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637e9f772222f6008eee9265","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3007263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Theo Rigby","original_name":"Theo Rigby","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637e9f80a410c800848120d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2674234","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
