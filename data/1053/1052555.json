The rector is Mrs. Marni and the students are Cahyono, Uuk, Djoni, Eddy Gombloh, Alicia Djohar and Deasy Surachman. The students always make fun of Jojon but he never gets angry. Once he sends for Gomblohâ€™s father, Mr. Karto, who is a porridge seller. As a result, he has to pay compensation to Mr. Karto, who was not able to sell anything for the whole day. The story ends with the wedding of Jojon and Diah. Apparently, the film was made to tap the popularity of the comedy quartet, Jojon and friends, and the film is not very different from what they usually perform on stage.","popularity":0.1059,"poster_path":"/p8N0INUItM8ub5MgJQxrN4hNOZh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Apa Ini Apa Itu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2411286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jojon","original_name":"Jojon","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":"/w87hJuONJVK56oEcdjsDR5U0hIT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jojon","credit_id":"637e6905514c4a0087882a4e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2666562,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Muryadi","original_name":"Muryadi","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637e67996e938a007ffea842","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3605498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elanda Rossi RS","original_name":"Elanda Rossi RS","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637e641a6e938a00871638ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.684,"height":1188,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p8N0INUItM8ub5MgJQxrN4hNOZh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":812}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
