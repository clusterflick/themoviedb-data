They were only allowed to use weapons in self-defense. In the summer of 1995, the Croatian Army ceasefire broke. Once there was no longer a ceasefire to monitor, the soldiers were ordered to stay inside their camp and not interfere in the war. It was therefore up to one Danish officer, to make the crucial decision: to give orders to shoot or follow the UN mandate and not intervene.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":"/eSNu3MdTPpUKipZA8gBq2atXHF7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29062,"logo_path":"/hwlA6f2HhaOJP1ZcrYL8f8g8UbJ.png","name":"Final Cut for Real","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":29736,"logo_path":"/ux2z8hoLJWFlN5Nz25d2CMk2tRs.png","name":"Nukleus film","origin_country":"HR"},{"id":758,"logo_path":"/fft3jrctrZNcgAxgN1w5Givtzip.png","name":"TV 2","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":118,"logo_path":"/AiBorgNTCS1lT1FdFPYheax9jfF.png","name":"Det Danske Filminstitut","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2015-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"},{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"15 Minutes - The Dvor Massacre","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3799765,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kasper Vedsmand","original_name":"Kasper Vedsmand","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637e5d216e938a0087163717","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2157113,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georg Larsen","original_name":"Georg Larsen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637e5d2e514c4a00999898c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5476912","wikidata_id":"Q33549659","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":1509,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eSNu3MdTPpUKipZA8gBq2atXHF7.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1059}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
