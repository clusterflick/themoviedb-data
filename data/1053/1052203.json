Personal, social and political contexts intersect into a dialogic narrative form that advances possibilities for new interpretations. The voiceover manifesto is manoeuvred to evoke personal trajectories and collective memories. By involving the essay film as a tool for creative exploring, one is able to discover and question the borders of an uncertain past, present and future. Having in mind that it’s subject - a patchwork of decontextualised memories - be they artificial or authentic, personal or historical, is something to be nursed.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/xf6mRabQs3Z4EVAssOMbnwMRwi9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bonding Humanity","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3088997,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Nina Bačun","original_name":"Nina Bačun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637d2f7d01757f00880bd053","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xf6mRabQs3Z4EVAssOMbnwMRwi9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":571}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
