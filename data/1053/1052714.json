The San Quentin Prison baseball team is the subject of this documentary short directed and produced by longtime journalist and filmmaker Larry Warner. The film goes inside the walls of the maximum-security prison to show the team, called the Giants, playing ball. Baseball becomes an instrument of rehabilitation through the guidance of Chaplain Earl Smith. It is the rules, the discipline and the nuances of averages within baseball that may help these inmates upon their release back into society.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Angels in the Outfield","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3622608,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Larry Warner","original_name":"Larry Warner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637ec0d0a410c800a43140a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
