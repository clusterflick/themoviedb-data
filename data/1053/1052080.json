Tunisia is almost the central character of this little film: we see the relation of the city to the sea, the traces that bear witness to its foundation, the remains of Carthage, the symbolism of the recently discovered Medina coin … The splendours of the house interiors and courtyards are associated with a scene of origin, what psychoanalysis calls a primal scene. Entering these houses opens up a world peopled by women: the child’s ‘homecoming’ in the hands of women is staged as an abduction, playing doubly on fascination and terror. These places were mine, from my childhood, they can be found almost intact – it’s the return of the exile visiting the kingdom. I let Ruiz discover all this, and immediately that led him to echoes and resonances ranging from Spain to Chile.","popularity":0.0769,"poster_path":"/5saju7uNh2Aucsk32cH3Ec2vur9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"TN","name":"Tunisia"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mirror of Tunisia/Tunisia, the Trance and the Stone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raúl Ruiz","original_name":"Raúl Ruiz","popularity":0.2407,"profile_path":"/gsJkcICbmk1GCi3EkDkxE6qZcpe.jpg","credit_id":"637ce894bb2602007fdd89ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5saju7uNh2Aucsk32cH3Ec2vur9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
