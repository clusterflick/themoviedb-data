A portrait as well as a moving-image still life of heritage-brand golden watch, the film’s modes of representation oscillate throughout thus undermining any stable point of view. The film’s sound is comprised of an re-edit, referring to the practice in popular music of distilling, extracting and repeating elements of an existing track in order to maximize its use value, typically for a dance setting.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/omds95q41mOOJnvpteQEZ0671Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Substance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2438263,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"David Hollander","original_name":"David Hollander","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637e6e832222f600846bab35","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3156540,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mathias Poledna","original_name":"Mathias Poledna","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637e6dd2a4af8f00832a710a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2184,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/omds95q41mOOJnvpteQEZ0671Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1456}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Exhibition, Renaissance Society, Chicago, IL.","release_date":"2014-12-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
