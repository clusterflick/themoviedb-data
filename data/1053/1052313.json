The story takes place inside the Yok Don National Park where Animals Asia homes a few retired elephants who used to work carrying tourists in the Dak Lak province, Vietnam. Together with H'Plo, AAF hired her mahout, Nhat, to work for the park close to his elephant. This is a story of resilience, camaraderie and trust between two different species who have always lived alongside each other.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/5BV5DRA998FbM7qbqz644Qdj5kt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Awakening of the Vietnamese Elephant","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3798894,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Teresa Carante","original_name":"Teresa Carante","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637d7a2cfe63180083caa7a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1199,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5BV5DRA998FbM7qbqz644Qdj5kt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Green Film Festival of San Francisco","release_date":"2022-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
