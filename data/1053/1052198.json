Under the cultural surface of the metropolis lies a flourishing art life, and alternative recreational activities are available. There are many who do not follow the mainstream taste, and do not fall for the temptation of the commercial media. The originators of Budapests subcultures and their audience represent hundreds of thousands of people. These subcultures and artists should not be underrated or disregarded. Moleman chooses five characters from this world, and allows us to peek through their eyes into a culture and lifestyle that lie out of the realm of celebrities, that is other than Pop Idol or the soap opera Between Friends or the pop band Hooligans. But it exists, creates works and is taking shape.","popularity":0.0522,"poster_path":"/cSFO23ZfELykFHd0gpklY5D4E4C.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moleman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Moleman","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3798623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ádám Balogh","original_name":"Ádám Balogh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"637d31447d41aa00ded863ab","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1684226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gábor Csépai","original_name":"Gábor Csépai","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"637d3151fe6318007e71c06f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3798624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nimród Csizmadia","original_name":"Nimród Csizmadia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"637d316aa5743d007c2d79a7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3798625,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gábor Hámori","original_name":"Gábor Hámori","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"637d3178fe6318007e71c083","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3798626,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Budha Tamás Kovács","original_name":"Budha Tamás Kovács","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"637d3184006eee0083316f40","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3798628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Artúr Kovács","original_name":"Oliver Artúr Kovács","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"637d318e2790bf00cffe8460","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3798629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"János Mrenkó","original_name":"János Mrenkó","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"637d319afe6318007e71c093","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3798630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gábor Pintér","original_name":"Gábor Pintér","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"637d31aa7d41aa00ded863d1","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3798632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"József Soós","original_name":"József Soós","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"637d31ba2790bf007ce9ebcc","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1837707,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Szilárd Matusik","original_name":"Szilárd Matusik","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/pHGNJfMipx1bjC7MuMoWAosoOzG.jpg","credit_id":"637d30da07528800e7450fbb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1684226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gábor Csépai","original_name":"Gábor Csépai","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637d30ec6a300b00df27c830","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1594941","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c9FBcYTe6Sczzf4yenLwJjfP5FU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iWukAv1g3eYMrAMwwmHEfOCRPbj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/haBy5hH9cGcuxm1sWozdbRN5zbr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iZKPYqd6ddeuzhjK8fQDREug4Um.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cSFO23ZfELykFHd0gpklY5D4E4C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hu","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
