In near 24-hour daylight, sailing by vast icebergs and sharing midnight encounters with humpback whales, we are invited into homes and communities along the way.  These heartfelt interactions reveal a generous and inviting people battling to hold onto a culture that forms their identity. A hunting society turned capitalist, local hunters no longer feed their communities. As the ice disappears around them, what future beckons? Perhaps one that offers an easier type of living, but one that brings its own difficulties.  This is a celebration of Greenlandâ€™s culture, a lament for a changing way of life and a yearning for a positive future for a culture facing such uncertain times.","popularity":0.0836,"poster_path":"/cxJRw5AllSP5RmuRBH7tlzUgG4y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Greenland Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3798908,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marieke Lexmond","original_name":"Marieke Lexmond","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637d7cca2790bf00968d285b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3798909,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Monahan","original_name":"Vincent Monahan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637d7cd0075288007bbc25b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21252390","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.718,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cxJRw5AllSP5RmuRBH7tlzUgG4y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1149}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Green Film Festival of San Francisco","release_date":"2022-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
