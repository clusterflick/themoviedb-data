Owen was the source from which the Tudor dynasty would eventually spring. 1461 - 1485 saw the Yorkists Edward IV, Edward V and Richard III on the throne, until in 1485 the Tudor reign began with Henry VII. Henry VII was followed in the year 1509 by probably the most famous of all the Tudor monarchs Henry VIII, who with his six wives takes a very colourful place in history. Then came Edward VI, Mary I and Elizabeth I, along with Lady Jane Grey (the nine day queen) who historically gets very little mention.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/56zWR8aGQMsnN7nnGtlrSxEmatx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kings and Queens of England - The Tudors - 1485-1603","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1732,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/56zWR8aGQMsnN7nnGtlrSxEmatx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1155}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
