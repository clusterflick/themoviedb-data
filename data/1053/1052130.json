The journey of Jishnu Mitra and how his dreams have provided hope to over 250 children in Delhi and Kolkata, India. It is the story of the 1st year of the Jishnu Mitra Foundation, where the children played under the banner of 'Dream Team' in the U-15 Delhi Youth League.  This short docu-drama explores the impact of football foundations in the sporting ecosystem in India. While exploring the themes of ambition, failure, the spirit of life, and love for 'the beautiful game' of football, the film is a celebration of hope, the display of true human spirit and grit that brings strangers together for a larger cause.","popularity":0.1171,"poster_path":"/qZCYu8wGgxgGYsZtupzCXnvuAYW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2022-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Never Ask Why","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":239706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saurabh Dubey","original_name":"Saurabh Dubey","popularity":0.101,"profile_path":"/6HLdxolLN06KfyR5KWNlt6WVZK9.jpg","credit_id":"637d1b7459bc07009d961590","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.659,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qZCYu8wGgxgGYsZtupzCXnvuAYW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":527}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Ealing Film Festival 2022","release_date":"2022-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
