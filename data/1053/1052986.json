Mini-Doc – Combining The Arts: Spaces For All","overview":"Lizzie Lovejoy’s mini-documentary explores the world of non-traditional performance spaces, especially in the Tees Valley and celebrating the fantastic work they do.  Lizzie spoke to Bobby Benjamin, artist and curator of Pineapple Black in Middlesbrough, about the exciting range of work the gallery has housed over the past couple of years during festivals, exhibitions and events. And from Redcar Palace Art Gallery, director James Beighton and curator Beth Smith of Tees Valley Arts discuss how the venue is used to create works as well as share them, and why accessibility has become one of their main focuses.\r People connect to performance in different ways than visual art, but both can be incredibly powerful and influential. Using local creative spaces to pull both together highlights how fantastic our local cultural community really is.\r This is an Art Mouse film for NARC. TV, written and directed by Lizzie Lovejoy.","popularity":0.1613,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":185423,"logo_path":null,"name":"Art Mouse","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"NARC.
