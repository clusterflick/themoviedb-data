It raises issues of racism, cultural imperialism and environmental destruction that remain highly relevant today. The film is based on a poetry sequence by Chrys Salt and a soundtrack by British composer Richard Ingham, and is voiced by Canadian actor Peter Marinker and the poet herself. Production was supported by Creative Scotland.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/7xcTfuVZiXjcwDG3z2XTh9ZV3mR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Skookum Jim and The American Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3798669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Smyth","original_name":"Ken Smyth","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637d3c92075288008366d9ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7xcTfuVZiXjcwDG3z2XTh9ZV3mR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":565}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
