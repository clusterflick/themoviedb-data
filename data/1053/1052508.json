It is the time of year when the sun is most intensely focused on one of the two hemispheres.  The solstices are related to esotericism and for many cultures they have a very important symbolism. For example, for some peoples, the summer solstice is a reason for great joy, because it represents the victory of Light over Darkness.  The solstice occurs twice a year, on June 21st and December 21st, marking the beginning of the seasons, which are opposite in each hemisphere.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/v7FUZnJFxjUBUrcn0WZuwLZT1bE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Solstice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1705712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adriano de Souza","original_name":"Adriano de Souza","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/5kExoE4uNqKRYABdpjULjvQJvhP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"637e3913fe631800e7a4759b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3799554,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Loïc Wirth","original_name":"Loïc Wirth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637e393101757f00880c3a38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3799556,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Erik Proost","original_name":"Erik Proost","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637e394859bc0700cf610bc7","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1515,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v7FUZnJFxjUBUrcn0WZuwLZT1bE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1010},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1515,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wBpzLzTBe48xHPWF6qA595WzKN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1010}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
