A woman holds onions to her eyes and  cries. The artist and the woman, taking turns at the blackboard, write Usura (Usury) and Amore e Misericordia (Love and Mercy). The artist, still blindfolded, moves toward the comer; the woman then plays on the harmonica the words they have written. Hearing the sound, the artist picks up two carafes of water. The second man stands up and rhythmically marches in place. His cadenced steps provide a reference point for the artist, who reaches the chairs, climbs onto them, and tries to pour water over the fish. After descending from the chairs he moves toward the marching man, takes a vial of chloroform from his pocket, inhales it, and passes out. The blindfolded woman on the bed urinates on the mattress and, turning over her hand, writes Canto Sospeso (Suspended Song) on the blackboard.  The man continues to march and the child continues to play his note on the accordion.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/cVASrpTvai6enA74YwhuoOpQZIA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"USURA, AMORE E MISERICORDIA","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3799516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pier Paolo Calzolari","original_name":"Pier Paolo Calzolari","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637e2e5c01757f00a5750d37","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cVASrpTvai6enA74YwhuoOpQZIA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
