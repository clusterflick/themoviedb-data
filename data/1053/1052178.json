The work, is meant to be an investigation of the concept of death, dear to me as a subject, having developed for years now an OCD toward the subject-death, in its sacredness and spirituality, understood here as an escape point from the real. Above a voice reads, almost like a litany, Meister Eckhart's prayer.  Is it in death that that annihilation of the will in relation to the One occurs?  Is it in the event of death that we are definitively reunited with the One, becoming a uniform mass with one another, thus ceasing to be a numerable unity and mutating into a space in which everything is reunited?","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2QjX9U2Ucl5krwtLhDpkHVjbGA2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SHEOL-ABADDON","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2646491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carmine Lo Regio","original_name":"Carmine Lo Regio","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637d2487075288007bbc0372","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2QjX9U2Ucl5krwtLhDpkHVjbGA2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
