Together the three of them survive by running a small firewood business and performing other odd jobs. Michelle is frustrated with living in poverty and being the center of several people who demand her affection; her brother is like a second child who lives in his own world, his romantic obsession with their wealthy client Madame Viau-Vachon being an exercise in futility. Maurice, the local police chief, is her lover and Gaetan, a mechanic and family friend, would like to be. Most demanding of all is her daughter, who has an unhealthy emotional dependence on her. Precocious and uninterested in school, Manon is jealous of her mother's suitors and angry at being left home to do chores and care for Guy. Then an event occurs that threatens the emotional dynamic between Manon and her mother.","popularity":0.4526,"poster_path":"/GlfYX8Vcw03ovUr0DE3kY6LTBv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187481,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Productions
