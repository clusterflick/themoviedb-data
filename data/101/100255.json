The narrator also cautions moviegoers against spreading rumors (which are often initiated by enemy infiltrators to create fear and dissention) and believing everything they read in the newspapers. Just because \"they say\" something, that doesn't make it true.","popularity":0.5022,"poster_path":"/zUfcNS8UHGGRslteCeDenL7QfqC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mr. Blabbermouth!","video":false,"vote_average":4.625,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":167922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Nesbitt","original_name":"John Nesbitt","popularity":0.1696,"profile_path":"/yKGHIGmZ1Lr1pYvpDmBPcOqm0nB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"52fe49d1c3a36847f81a7d83","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Peters","original_name":"Ralph Peters","popularity":0.1351,"profile_path":"/wyGyt7YKwFRqAgInjdvG2sKBlue.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mr. Blabbermouth","credit_id":"5c487abf0e0a264962ccb3a7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93626,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Berkes","original_name":"John Berkes","popularity":0.1612,"profile_path":"/pp2OCgDrAnHqal9jLZcxgtmc3UX.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5c487ad792514105c150661d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stanley Andrews","original_name":"Stanley Andrews","popularity":0.4338,"profile_path":"/zAW09eb1f0g4OPtNkJk83ej1os5.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5c487afd0e0a263ccdcc379c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"May McAvoy","original_name":"May McAvoy","popularity":0.1527,"profile_path":"/r1twk0uEppt3dhuZqi4Zx7Nq0NP.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5c487b249251410e1b53a513","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1499,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Basil Wrangell","original_name":"Basil Wrangell","popularity":0.1686,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49d1c3a36847f81a7d73","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":135364,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Manchester Boddy","original_name":"Manchester Boddy","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49d1c3a36847f81a7d79","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1024195,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Walter Selden","original_name":"Walter Selden","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49d1c3a36847f81a7d7f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13289,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Adrienne Fazan","original_name":"Adrienne Fazan","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c487a86c3a368477788bcb9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31767,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jackson Rose","original_name":"Jackson Rose","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec421b72dffd80021718017","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0035088","wikidata_id":"Q5390298","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zUfcNS8UHGGRslteCeDenL7QfqC.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1Hf8HhM9mxUms3f1tSTUm2N3jPv.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sazoz4UYzC4j5sXUHiv5E9GpZMz.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1942-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
