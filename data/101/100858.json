He also learns that in order to reestablish a livable atmosphere for what's left of humanity, he'll have to go on a solitary mission to retrieve important codes dispersed in remote locations. Soon enough, he'll encounter more than he bargained for: aliens, crazy survivors, inadequate equipment, LOTS of walking and a pretty unhealthy dose of bad luck.","popularity":0.0522,"poster_path":"/ZpN5TIpwKaOVYty4TOBnrli6VQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"REBORN TO LOSE.","title":"Hellacious Acres: The Case of John Glass","video":false,"vote_average":2.8,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2639629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamie Abrams","original_name":"Jamie Abrams","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"James Walker","credit_id":"5ebea47bbc8abc0021c35a2b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2639631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paula Davis","original_name":"Paula Davis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Recorded Voice","credit_id":"5ebea4913d3557001ee06eca","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2639632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Navin Pratap","original_name":"Navin Pratap","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"John Glass","credit_id":"5ebea4c98e2e00002115ddf8","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1643974,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pat Tremblay","original_name":"Pat Tremblay","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6e381f65686e38998859c6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1643974,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pat Tremblay","original_name":"Pat Tremblay","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebea4fe6d675a00217c47b9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1828194","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ZpN5TIpwKaOVYty4TOBnrli6VQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Hellacious Acres : The Case of John Glass * Trailer 2","key":"UgE-Cl2Es7I","published_at":"2011-07-08T00:21:07.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6dcc3a36854480082fe"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Hellacious Acres : The Case of John Glass * Trailer 1","key":"IhmiHQVtJiw","published_at":"2011-06-02T23:07:50.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6dcc3a36854480082ff"}]}}}
