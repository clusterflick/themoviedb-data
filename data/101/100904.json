Morgan makes his headquarters at the Halfway House run by the parents of Maria Styx as a bar and dance resort catering to the planters and traders of the island. Taggert finds himself practically a prisoner along with a group of American girls acting as entertainers at the resort. Taggert shadows Morgan in his activities in a remote cove and finds that Morgan is supplying German U-boat commanders with torpedoes, but does not know that Morgan has rigged the torpedoes with clock devices that explode when at sea and sinks the U-boats.","popularity":0.9243,"poster_path":"/cJAfucDHD0gr8GQdDfNF329qiHc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16466,"logo_path":"/4MT9eqAB0bHzhaFVVniMaxlJ5xS.png","name":"PRC","origin_country":"US"},{"id":8481,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jack Schwarz Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1943-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"I'm An Outcast!!!
