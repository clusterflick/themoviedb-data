Five core elements of life that once inspired a book. The Book of Fate. Far away from here there was a mythical world -free of suffering and injustice. But it wasn't enough. People wanted to play God... They created a pen to control the Book of Fate. Mightier than a sword, it could write off deeds -and bring back the dead. But the book gave power, power caused fear -and fear brought suffering. And the suffering caused wars. Darkness fell on earth, making demands on the pen and the book. But the book was gone. It was thought to be lost forever -but hundreds of years later it reappeared on a small planet called Earth. The prophecy says: Only the chosen will get a second chance from the book. The destiny of the chosen one is to guide the book back. But his journey will be long, filled with errors and grief. This is his story.","popularity":0.4239,"poster_path":"/9lzYNnjLtaeRUQJJltPsZp41IBq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108679,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tampereen Ammattikorkeakoulu / Taiteen Ja
