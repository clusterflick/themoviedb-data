He doesn't cash his paychecks and has no contact other than the monthly inspector's visit. When alone, he imagines conversations with those who died when a 19th century packet ship with some 60 passengers sank. He imagines their lives, their problems, their fears and their hopes. In one of these conversations, he recalls his own efforts in the 1930s when he desperately tried to convince first his editors, and later the public, of the dangers of fascism and the inevitability of war. Few would listen. One of the passengers, a spinster, tells her story of seeking independence from a world dominated by men. There's also the case of a doctor who is banished for using unacceptable methods. David has given up on life, but the imaginary passengers give him hope for the future.","popularity":1.2785,"poster_path":"/bCLeo6GZXFgjhoFduwdAz3D8Qdi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8622,"logo_path":null,"name":"Charter Film Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Strange Emotion Stir the Pulse...when LOVE and PASSION clash in the world's loneliest outpost!","title":"Thunder Rock","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":17,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Redgrave","original_name":"Michael Redgrave","popularity":0.3425,"profile_path":"/eZsZ11LnWcb89LpY9jjALXhmqSb.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"David Charleston","credit_id":"52fe49dbc3a36847f81aa0f5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":97242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Mullen","original_name":"Barbara Mullen","popularity":0.1213,"profile_path":"/v3GXac9xzCKOyulyi7Z817DpV3u.jpg","cast_id":1004,"character":"Ellen Kirby","credit_id":"52fe49dbc3a36847f81aa0f9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Mason","original_name":"James Mason","popularity":1.0341,"profile_path":"/ivmJl4jLgYoxI93EPgBehund505.jpg","cast_id":1005,"character":"Streeter","credit_id":"52fe49dbc3a36847f81aa0fd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":27932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lilli Palmer","original_name":"Lilli Palmer","popularity":0.4499,"profile_path":"/n34gwTvKpvHF1r8KMrjtxMdK0N7.jpg","cast_id":1006,"character":"Melanie Kurtz","credit_id":"52fe49dbc3a36847f81aa101","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Finlay Currie","original_name":"Finlay Currie","popularity":0.5696,"profile_path":"/okHKOxm5wmFu513NsK3JNI7fMkr.jpg","cast_id":1007,"character":"Capt.
