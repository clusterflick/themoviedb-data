While aboard, they have a brief run-in with (a secret German Nazi officer) Lt. Dungen (Vernon Dent), and then mistake a torpedo for a beached whale. Moe says they have to kill it, and it promptly explodes. After being lost at sea for several days, they come across the SS Schicklgruber and climb aboard. Now with fully grown beards, they come across Lt. Dungen again, who does not recognize them. After realizing they are on a German war ship they eventually overtake the crew and toss them overboard.","popularity":0.8646,"poster_path":"/hF7GrvCIIzsdzxb1IN3BYz0hPuI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1943-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Any resemblance between the characters in this picture and other human beings is a dirty shame.","title":"Back from the Front","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89614,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Curly Howard","original_name":"Curly Howard","popularity":0.2883,"profile_path":"/ozWdyoTNqWy55bOglIFqR4ZalwZ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Curly","credit_id":"52fe49ddc3a36847f81aa7ef","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Fine","original_name":"Larry Fine","popularity":0.3206,"profile_path":"/zdT16UWESRhhT48KGeXibmQzslQ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Larry","credit_id":"52fe49ddc3a36847f81aa7f3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moe Howard","original_name":"Moe Howard","popularity":0.6107,"profile_path":"/93l6M2P42vracu6cfzuOqmYBYk1.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Moe","credit_id":"52fe49ddc3a36847f81aa7f7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stanley Blystone","original_name":"Stanley Blystone","popularity":0.179,"profile_path":"/9kYGxCZeyYJWTJuvpt7YFrZOx3Y.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Herr Capitan (uncredited)","credit_id":"626af22e489d000052515648","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vernon Dent","original_name":"Vernon Dent","popularity":0.1824,"profile_path":"/hIZai6jeEnoomMjlJm2bhHSQ15O.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Lt.
