Rodgers' contribution to musical theatre was extraordinary, including 900 published songs, 40 Broadway musicals and several film scores.  Rodgers, together with lyricists Lorenz Hart and later Oscar Hammerstein II, wrote many of the best known musicals of the 20th Century, including Babes In Arms, Oklahoma!, Carousel, South Pacific, The King and I and The Sound of Music.  This performance at London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, directed for the stage by Simon Callow, includes songs, dance, staged numbers and anecdotes featuring leading stars from both Broadway and London's West End.  The cast comprises luminaries drawn from Oklahoma!, Kiss Me Kate, Chicago, The King and I and other recent productions as well as from television.  This musical extravaganza features many of Rodgers' best-loved classics.","popularity":0.9978,"poster_path":"/fBqBQ9Rg63kyefLnaHVjHlwN5zO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Richard Rodgers: Some Enchanted Evening","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":117315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruthie Henshall","original_name":"Ruthie Henshall","popularity":0.181,"profile_path":"/dzn1aUXnAKrbYEa3MdR1uXgBCYc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Performer: 'My Funny Valentine'","credit_id":"52fe49e0c3a36847f81ab3af","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1025600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Willetts","original_name":"Dave Willetts","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe49e0c3a36847f81ab3b3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judi Dench","original_name":"Judi Dench","popularity":1.3025,"profile_path":"/cpna5VGvAxuKuC31xJPBKy9zbnv.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Performer: \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\"","credit_id":"52fe49e0c3a36847f81ab3b7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":12214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gillian Anderson","original_name":"Gillian Anderson","popularity":3.4912,"profile_path":"/60fOJNhmfEmyskQDmHStSMHRjgK.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self - Performer","credit_id":"52fe49e0c3a36847f81ab3bb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1025601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sally Burgess","original_name":"Sally Burgess","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Performer","credit_id":"52fe49e0c3a36847f81ab3bf","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1025602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Criswell","original_name":"Kim Criswell","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/cm6txkkVh9D2G1dkqS7XDfCPXge.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Performer","credit_id":"52fe49e0c3a36847f81ab3c3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1025603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lesley Garrett","original_name":"Lesley Garrett","popularity":0.0779,"profile_path":"/1uUAiqtJFz6RQnPN2SIVgC1IDAh.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Performer","credit_id":"52fe49e0c3a36847f81ab3c7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maureen Lipman","original_name":"Maureen Lipman","popularity":0.3256,"profile_path":"/kx26NOAw9GnsHjJIJ4l40YHblJ.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Performer","credit_id":"52fe49e0c3a36847f81ab3cb","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1025604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Moore","original_name":"Claire Moore","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe49e0c3a36847f81ab3cf","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":157758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josie Lawrence","original_name":"Josie Lawrence","popularity":0.2149,"profile_path":"/nJCPwGpzaJlet1tzXAujjDYCMdK.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe49e0c3a36847f81ab3d3","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":95754,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andy Picheta","original_name":"Andy Picheta","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49e0c3a36847f81ab3ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Callow","original_name":"Simon Callow","popularity":0.8836,"profile_path":"/no6qlnMrWeUzSt1FjD2Vf9x992e.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49e0c3a36847f81ab3a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0365689","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":1400,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fBqBQ9Rg63kyefLnaHVjHlwN5zO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":982}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
