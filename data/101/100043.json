The young woman, despite the threats and hopelessness of the situation, believes in justice and true feelings. She manages to unite like-minded people around her and repulse \"the powers that be\".  The ridiculous and ridiculous attempts of Lera and her team to save the School, spontaneity and naivety, cause bewilderment in Artyom Rudakov, and then genuine interest. Having met with Leroy, he realizes that this is the real and only love for which he strove all his life, walking towards her step by step.","popularity":0.2588,"poster_path":"/ceARb5ksoaloXcxwnlxnOLBEMtd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2011-03-31","revenue":12255,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Love
