Actually, they are attempting to avoid the draft but when their plane, the Buzzard, fails miserably, they march off to war. Richard Fiske, formerly a busy supporting player in Stooges comedies, appears courtesy of stock footage from the earlier Boobs in Arms (1940). Ironically, Fiske had himself been drafted and would be killed in action in France in August of 1944.","popularity":0.3781,"poster_path":"/ikrHFVaOjuJrwl08TiO2hDdgWMU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1943-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dizzy Pilots","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Além de Idiotas, Aéreos","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89614,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Curly Howard","original_name":"Curly Howard","popularity":0.2883,"profile_path":"/ozWdyoTNqWy55bOglIFqR4ZalwZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Curly Wrong","credit_id":"52fe49ddc3a36847f81aa87b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Fine","original_name":"Larry Fine","popularity":0.3206,"profile_path":"/zdT16UWESRhhT48KGeXibmQzslQ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Larry Wrong","credit_id":"52fe49ddc3a36847f81aa87f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moe Howard","original_name":"Moe Howard","popularity":0.6107,"profile_path":"/93l6M2P42vracu6cfzuOqmYBYk1.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Moe Wrong","credit_id":"52fe49ddc3a36847f81aa883","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Fiske","original_name":"Richard Fiske","popularity":0.1872,"profile_path":"/9HpRvRbP2tBF5hOmC5maqtCokLK.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Sergeant (archive footage) (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe49ddc3a36847f81aa887","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobby Barber","original_name":"Bobby Barber","popularity":0.1369,"profile_path":"/hshe0L8zSxTEUuN1SPHRRoeOmSb.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Private (uncredited)","credit_id":"5918c79f925141061e0433dc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":136529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Dorety","original_name":"Charles Dorety","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/nAp7j4pXQjdXII7TxRq8SQwNjcv.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Private (uncredited)","credit_id":"64fc7c7fdb4ed61033a04fff","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1062858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judy Malcolm","original_name":"Judy Malcolm","popularity":0.0854,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Girl in Hangar (uncredited)","credit_id":"64fc7c8fdb4ed61038543d21","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Semels","original_name":"Harry Semels","popularity":0.1865,"profile_path":"/7iCxFHAesyHDEM0susMJSCK8w40.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Sky Aircraft Co.
