They are neither heroes nor criminals, but everyday people who will become victims of everyday life. The events that take place will be read about today and forgotten tomorrow, but in that blink-of-an-eye, their lives and the lives of the people around them will be changed forever. It happens every day. Despite the tragedies, this is not a story about dying, but is in fact a very uplifting story about living. The message is simple: cherish life today because no one is guaranteed a tomorrow.","popularity":0.6089,"poster_path":"/42m8E5nDBVwUiSe5d7dE8vZWGQa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Something happens everyday to change the way people think.","title":"Statistics","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":67696,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kent Harper","original_name":"Kent Harper","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/1O1WF7dtRCNmnp1k5o6TNP6yM8d.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"David Allen","credit_id":"64c0433eb3316b011c70543f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2332345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Rudolph","original_name":"Scott Rudolph","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/jsTBzCKWpB4ZNP0s1RO0Bf0EiA7.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jack Kindle","credit_id":"64c043626d4c9700e276666d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":154467,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trish Suhr","original_name":"Trish Suhr","popularity":0.2502,"profile_path":"/rlRKcCapugQfJm4Kyd3YlKNHKfV.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Stephanie","credit_id":"64c0439d058224010fde6af7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Wozniak","original_name":"Stephen Wozniak","popularity":0.124,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Steve Varner","credit_id":"64c043aab3316b00c5bbe56a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":167098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marilyn McIntyre","original_name":"Marilyn McIntyre","popularity":0.1997,"profile_path":"/uDNtpZq1DeUTelvQAw0TwJh4SPq.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Norma","credit_id":"64c043d38ee49c0fce45ef29","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1900228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sinclair DuMont","original_name":"Sinclair DuMont","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Katie","credit_id":"64c043e817c44300c6cd38ce","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":62280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ange Billman","original_name":"Ange Billman","popularity":0.3253,"profile_path":"/dUL13RQNrjqIxB6RN9n0u5nevrw.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"64c043ff6d4c97011cba590d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4972500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shelley Mack","original_name":"Shelley Mack","popularity":0.1374,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Shelley","credit_id":"66faf7653a0f5a08c8f1a4d9","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2332345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Rudolph","original_name":"Scott Rudolph","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/jsTBzCKWpB4ZNP0s1RO0Bf0EiA7.jpg","credit_id":"64c043786d4c97011cba58ce","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4180227,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Robak","original_name":"Frank Robak","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c0431b6ee3d700e6ff2c24","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4180227,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Robak","original_name":"Frank Robak","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c0432c6d4c9701393d33a7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4180227,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Robak","original_name":"Frank Robak","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c04318b3316b011c705429","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4180227,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Robak","original_name":"Frank Robak","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c043246d4c9701393d339e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0311862","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/42m8E5nDBVwUiSe5d7dE8vZWGQa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Rhode Island International Film Festival","release_date":"2006-08-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
