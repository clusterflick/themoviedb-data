It integrates in its theory and practice the findings from modern consciousness research, depth psychology, and mystical traditions of the world. Among the innovations of this revolutionary approach to therapy and self-exploration is the use of a vastly expanded model of the human psyche, new understanding of the architecture of emotional and psychosomatic disorders, and mobilization of the inner healing intelligence and new therapeutic mechanisms. The essential element in this treatment modality is utilization of the healing potential of non-ordinary states of consciousness, induced by very simple means - faster breathing, evocative music, releasing bodywork, and expressive painting.","popularity":0.2285,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2009-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Holotropic Breathwork with Klaus John","title":"A Trip to Inside","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1022768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klaus John","original_name":"Klaus John","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1001,"character":"himself","credit_id":"52fe49c7c3a36847f81a5ab9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stanislav Grof","original_name":"Stanislav Grof","popularity":0.1779,"profile_path":"/fhkbEjuhav6mHLsXWLolHOp1AmF.jpg","cast_id":1002,"character":"himself","credit_id":"52fe49c7c3a36847f81a5abd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1014940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christina Grof","original_name":"Christina Grof","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"herself","credit_id":"52fe49c7c3a36847f81a5ac1","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1022766,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juri Schmidt","original_name":"Juri Schmidt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49c7c3a36847f81a5ab5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2800,"name":"psychology"},{"id":5707,"name":"childhood trauma"},{"id":157152,"name":"alternate states"},{"id":157153,"name":"holotropic"},{"id":157154,"name":"psychotherapy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
