With only one working fighter of their own, and five pilots anxious to fly it, the Dutch commander chooses George Collins to fly a mission to drop a 500-lb bomb on the Japanese carrier lying offshore. As the flight progresses, the commander asks the other pilots to tell him about George. They recount his rise from brilliant law student, through the time he became involved in the corrupt machine of his state's Governor, and his attempts to redeem himself, both in his own eyes, and in Fredie, his long-time love.","popularity":1.7605,"poster_path":"/6XMZYvHWHEWeQ3TrtaLA6OQRVOx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1943-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Be There When It Happens!","title":"Pilot #5","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Pilot No. 5","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franchot Tone","original_name":"Franchot Tone","popularity":0.2974,"profile_path":"/dI6TE8qane88wOkZGG6alMFjpcu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"George Braynor Collins","credit_id":"52fe49e2c3a36847f81ab883","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1215925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marsha Hunt","original_name":"Marsha Hunt","popularity":0.4358,"profile_path":"/r4vTrX77yxFSTbIYXZVWRaDfCZ3.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Freddie Andrews","credit_id":"52fe49e2c3a36847f81ab897","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gene Kelly","original_name":"Gene Kelly","popularity":0.7455,"profile_path":"/qpxdcekD3x77J6dIxMOUfJifu49.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Vito S.
