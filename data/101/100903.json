This DVD/CD combo marks the rap-rock heavyweight's triumphant return after a four-year absence. Super producers Rick Rubin and Mike Shinoda join the band in crafting MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT, a full-length album that features the single \"What I've Done.\" The DVD also includes downloadable MP3s for each of the songs, plus it takes fans behind the scenes of the album's creation.","popularity":0.6821,"poster_path":"/1UZAefVJyJEozYzJKEfI8AF15pu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174,"logo_path":"/zhD3hhtKB5qyv7ZeL4uLpNxgMVU.png","name":"Warner Bros.
