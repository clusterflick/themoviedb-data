Because he is so well-loved by women, he lost his last position. His former servant Franz has not abandoned him in his time of need and the servant keeps trying to find a rich bride for the former Count. In the Grand Hotel, where the Count is supposed to be finding a suitable mate, he instead flirts with the attractive Alice. In order to get a job with the employer Ottokar Frühwirt, Rudi uses Count Lerchenau as a reference. But then the employer wants to speak with Lerchenau and Franz has to play the role of the Count. Alice, it turns out, is the employer's niece. When she finds out that Rudi is only a chauffeur, she wants nothing to do with him.","popularity":0.32,"poster_path":"/jOzP0GzIwxFZLK0P1G0aakkjLVs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1943-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adventure in the Grand Hotel","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolf Albach-Retty","original_name":"Wolf Albach-Retty","popularity":0.0592,"profile_path":"/4hh5ZAV3C7FQ2g4SOngiVkWoiJq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Rudolf, Count Lerchenau / Rudi Lindt","credit_id":"52fe49dfc3a36847f81aaf4d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Moser","original_name":"Hans Moser","popularity":0.4675,"profile_path":"/xnUAqGWMQZaFTEB9ikoP9vrUq8M.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Franz","credit_id":"52fe49dfc3a36847f81aaf51","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":39047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carola Höhn","original_name":"Carola Höhn","popularity":0.2765,"profile_path":"/AlRenogTA3QVL4HFUbMDGxXz3jn.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Alice","credit_id":"52fe49dfc3a36847f81aaf55","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":48939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Andergast","original_name":"Maria Andergast","popularity":0.2469,"profile_path":"/eJ3cBq8BiuVNTrtFRflmxB3Szy9.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Käthe","credit_id":"52fe49dfc3a36847f81aaf59","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":49298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erika von Thellmann","original_name":"Erika von Thellmann","popularity":0.0762,"profile_path":"/pt0guA84mxxtzl4BK7Dr1N8e8JS.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Aunt Emma","credit_id":"52fe49dfc3a36847f81aaf5d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Loni Heuser","original_name":"Loni Heuser","popularity":0.1708,"profile_path":"/3cHZQ7X0KbXbyw96tGYE1NypOoj.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Hella Schnappich","credit_id":"52fe49dfc3a36847f81aaf85","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theodor Danegger","original_name":"Theodor Danegger","popularity":0.0802,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"President Ottokar Frühwirt","credit_id":"52fe49dfc3a36847f81aaf61","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolf Carl","original_name":"Rudolf Carl","popularity":0.1404,"profile_path":"/dssc7XtL5zSIiGpzOKtuKtIJFFo.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Herr Duschek u.
