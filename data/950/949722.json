Then we used the new camera to record the world around us. But it was only when the moving image was finally seen on screen by its very first audience that cinema truly began. Air, speed, the world at 24fps: the modern world was promisingly, thrillingly, on the move. Or that’s what we thought.  Today a virus has disrupted the smooth momentum of our shared world. The continuum that cinema always promised is one of this virus’ many casualties. From time to time essential quarantines shut the doors on communal spaces. When that happens it is up to us, the audience, to play our part: to keep the space of cinema open.","popularity":0.0759,"poster_path":"/jLu8wolew2r5LC1BvxQeu7xTydG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7281,"logo_path":"/iI7qdR1OFPo0U41BlpKBLD3xesh.png","name":"BFI","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":171629,"logo_path":null,"name":"University of East Anglia","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Projectionism","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1650078,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Wood","original_name":"Sarah Wood","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62307c9ccc9683007bcdac09","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jLu8wolew2r5LC1BvxQeu7xTydG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ICO Screening Days March 2022","release_date":"2022-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
