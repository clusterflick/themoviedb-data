I do not want to tell the story to keep the curiosity of the audience, but I emphasize that the film is completely in line with the genre. However, our aim is not to stay in the standards, but to fill the action with other content, and it gives meaning to everything else. \"  Metodi Andonov","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Big Boredom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545057,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Metodi Andonov","original_name":"Metodi Andonov","popularity":0.0752,"profile_path":"/bCqcjHHf71rWfYqPBXKNmTi6Ml2.jpg","credit_id":"62325f85d18b24001c488b1e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"bg","note":"","release_date":"1973-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
