At a time when we couldn’t see some of those whom we love most, the making of this film felt even more poignant.","popularity":0.4017,"poster_path":"/wqibd9VxQKNaNYUXSqq92EHIzNR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":171572,"logo_path":null,"name":"Benjamin Goldman Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":171573,"logo_path":null,"name":"Enlightened Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How playing a human centipede taught me the meaning of Hanukkah.","title":"Eight Nights","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3465537,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Harry Buerkle","original_name":"Harry Buerkle","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622f7a800e44190079a80e7a","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3465517,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamin Goldman","original_name":"Benjamin Goldman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622f77b2006eee001e724a08","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3465517,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamin Goldman","original_name":"Benjamin Goldman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622f77f1006eee0074bdd906","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1190048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Gamburg","original_name":"Daniel Gamburg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622f786298f1f1001bb7438a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1039396,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jonathan Louis Lewis","original_name":"Jonathan Louis Lewis","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622f7ab6006eee0074bde421","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1958052,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gus Koven","original_name":"Gus Koven","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622f7acea6fdaa001b810ce5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1190048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Gamburg","original_name":"Daniel Gamburg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622f78712866fa001b52e593","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3465517,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamin Goldman","original_name":"Benjamin Goldman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622f78a52a210c0045dfa763","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1190048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Gamburg","original_name":"Daniel Gamburg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622f7a592866fa001b52ed89","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1190048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Gamburg","original_name":"Daniel Gamburg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622f785398f1f1001bb7433b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3465517,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamin Goldman","original_name":"Benjamin Goldman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622f7b69e04aca001b879f85","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131239,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marshall Curry","original_name":"Marshall Curry","popularity":0.1108,"profile_path":"/e0JjVZQ02r1diqUhQafSopFWq1w.jpg","credit_id":"67b74e549f7fb2a7436587cc","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13567666","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":840,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wqibd9VxQKNaNYUXSqq92EHIzNR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":561}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7328,"name":"hanukkah"},{"id":11704,"name":"judaism"},{"id":33576,"name":"menorah "},{"id":187197,"name":"jewish culture"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Released on The New Yorker","release_date":"2020-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
