None of the scenes are necessarily associated with specific signs of the Zodiac. Lawrence Jordan instead assembled twelve of his collages and passed them in review before the deity (who, as he has noted, never revealed her pleasure or displeasure with these images). The filmmaker underscored the mood of each scene with a short passage of music. One might say that theses scenes are not meant to convey particular meanings to a viewer but are intended to represent various entrances or, as the Egyptians called them, hidden or false doors to the siprit world, the world of the dead, the Underworld, the Bardo or, simply, another plan of reality: verities of the soul in Symbolist terms.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/cFAUEGmWEb4U7Cid68tfn7zHmFf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1959-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Minerva Looks Out into the Zodiac","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":267634,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lawrence Jordan","original_name":"Lawrence Jordan","popularity":0.2613,"profile_path":"/nELFCK1hpF0pmhRSQy9EdWrVG6R.jpg","credit_id":"62310ae43c3ab0001edf9b3a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cFAUEGmWEb4U7Cid68tfn7zHmFf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1959-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
