He is the last child of Arki, a small island located in the far east of Greece. Less than forty inhabitants live there all year round. For the last four years, the primary public school has remained open for one pupil only. Maria Tsialera, Christos’s teacher, travels every week to Arki from the neighboring island where she lives to ensure his schooling, convinced that learning is essential for the development of this insular child. At the end of his primary school years, Christos might work with his parents and his older brothers in the family farm. But Maria Tsialera is doing whatever she can for him to continue his scholarship on another island.","popularity":0.2826,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Child of Arki Island","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Το τελευταίο παιδί των Αρκιών","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2320497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sébastien Daguerressar","original_name":"Sébastien Daguerressar","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622e7652cf4b8b00210bba3d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3464686,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clémentine Athanasiadis","original_name":"Clémentine Athanasiadis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622e76444e4dff001b878066","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1200,"name":"greece"},{"id":293886,"name":"arki island"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
