He lived a childhood in the Paris of the 1920s, upset by his love of drawing and painting thwarted by an abusive mother. Delivered to his own fantasies, the hero indulges in the most disordered introspection and will end up consuming himself to become the reincarnation of the one he is trying to copy: Hans Pauli Weyergans, painter of the 18th century.","popularity":0.3701,"poster_path":"/y5jbE2u4L2Qos4QWUNtD7tDRUcJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1971-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"HPW ou Anatomie d'un faussaire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vania Vilers","original_name":"Vania Vilers","popularity":0.1412,"profile_path":"/feuwFPWk5dCCNQhK12H5szdTsG5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hugo-Paul de Weydroos","credit_id":"622e77f5688cd0007192f26c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3464690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Baptiste Chardin","original_name":"Jean-Baptiste Chardin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Hans Pauli Weyergans","credit_id":"622e77f94e4dff001b878708","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1360104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Jacobsen","original_name":"Catherine Jacobsen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Lorraine","credit_id":"622e78034e4dff001b878735","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":150916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nita Klein","original_name":"Nita Klein","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Cécile","credit_id":"622e7808cf4b8b007dfd1521","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Éric Baugin","original_name":"Éric Baugin","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Child","credit_id":"622e7813cf4b8b004a8065ec","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1768947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacqueline Dane","original_name":"Jacqueline Dane","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"622e78184e4dff00451cff45","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Fayolle","original_name":"Marc Fayolle","popularity":0.0991,"profile_path":"/2Cvct2fmu1vUuc0UGLJF1jlN4bi.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Lawyer","credit_id":"622e782421621d007a36c44a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Bazil","original_name":"Robert Bazil","popularity":0.1407,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Investigating judge","credit_id":"622e782b2866fa001b4ff7b2","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":579457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raoul Saint-Yves","original_name":"Raoul Saint-Yves","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Policeman","credit_id":"622e78335f622b001c9c3d38","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Martin","original_name":"Jean Martin","popularity":0.3037,"profile_path":"/f7J7ItHt6AHz8z2PQuWpdH0lCHz.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Bjorn","credit_id":"622e783acf4b8b00210bc389","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Marie Proslier","original_name":"Jean-Marie Proslier","popularity":0.1167,"profile_path":"/nBbiL1rdyFBcFQGMx1W3AFuuO8A.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Croisset","credit_id":"622e7842aad9c2001b513a54","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297477,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alain Boudet","original_name":"Alain Boudet","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622e77d298f1f100459c68ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2427258","wikidata_id":"Q3125166","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/y5jbE2u4L2Qos4QWUNtD7tDRUcJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-07-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
