Only the Rik Emmett-free clips for \"Child of the City\" and \"Love Hurts\" -- recorded with later-day replacement Phil Xeniids -- briefly interrupt the nostalgic dream feel with evidence of cold harsh reality, but, well, listeners had to wake up sometime. This collection still fulfills its mission as the delivering the definitive Triumph primer.","popularity":0.0448,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":27955,"logo_path":null,"name":"Round Hill Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Triumph: Greatest Hits","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":226995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rik Emmett","original_name":"Rik Emmett","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"622e7f825a5ed00045f1fc94","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3464719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theofilos \"Phil X\" Xenidis","original_name":"Theofilos \"Phil X\" Xenidis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"622e8079cddbbc0047376bfe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2686540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Levine","original_name":"Mike Levine","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"622e809e65c26c00771b9fa5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":226996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gil Moore","original_name":"Gil Moore","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"622e80b898f1f100459c90e1","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
