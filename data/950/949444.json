Her partner Hou Yao, who tragically died during the war, collaborated with her on her films. Made just a year after World War II ended, the film begins before the war comes to Malaya and reflects upon the struggles of newly-emigrated and affluent Chinese immigrants who have to choose between the comfortable luxury of their lives in Singapore and returning to their motherland to fight the enemy.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1946-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spirit of the Overseas Chinese","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3465413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wan Hoi-Ling","original_name":"Wan Hoi-Ling","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622f5e400e44190045238b31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1946-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
