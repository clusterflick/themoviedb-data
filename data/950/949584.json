This one, who intends to leave her, tries to make her understand what he is up to without hurting her too much, hypersensitive as she is. All means are good: big words, cajolery, denial, lies. As for the woman, who senses that this is the end, she desperately tries to win him back, passing from tenderness to passion, from the threat of attempted suicide to calm, from regret to outbursts of violence.","popularity":0.1356,"poster_path":"/wljPUwj4ptOVrFut9duXejhWOCc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1293,"logo_path":"/4r2EdENtYK1Ddxmciod3XvmfA9k.png","name":"Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":125800,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Prieuré","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1971-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Human Voice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3465902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denise Duval","original_name":"Denise Duval","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/3otv9KmHuKvo177JSf32SrqaelH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The lover on the phone","credit_id":"622fee61cba36f00741b4f8a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545542,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominique Delouche","original_name":"Dominique Delouche","popularity":0.1232,"profile_path":"/uAp8kh7WcwhIYYotpLrZ7abulyR.jpg","credit_id":"622fee3b23a31400454fe2a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34907,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jean Penzer","original_name":"Jean Penzer","popularity":0.0995,"profile_path":"/3FxBNW5FJlJUpfEvO4L95szyfGq.jpg","credit_id":"654365bf6beaea012c8c9bc2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1569677,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Francis Poulenc","original_name":"Francis Poulenc","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b5abc25ad76b0085e83e39","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Cocteau","original_name":"Jean Cocteau","popularity":0.265,"profile_path":"/vD73WSmN0hH3ZDjlh6n73CJI5sC.jpg","credit_id":"63b5abdd9715ae0082d61ae0","department":"Writing","job":"Book"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5375986","wikidata_id":"Q71840632","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/wljPUwj4ptOVrFut9duXejhWOCc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":524}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
