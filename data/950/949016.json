Yet, it is with the ocean that Fabrizio Maltese’s journey begins. He has accepted Abderrahmane Sissako’s invitation to continue the film he and Pol Cruchten had initiated together. Pol has since passed away. The project he had been dreaming of has thus taken on a new, symbolic dimension. It must see the light of day. This is why Fabrizio has traveled on his own to meet with the Mauritanian director. But fate seems to have decided otherwise. From Saint Louis in Senegal to Nouakchott in Mauritania, from Mata Moulana to Chinguetti, Fabrizio allows himself to get lost alone in the desert, with nothing more than a few scribbled notes jotted down on the piece of paper that was given to him by the two filmmakers.","popularity":0.0793,"poster_path":"/ja2vWhHn3oET6p8AD0c9ZkCTR5D.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17234,"logo_path":"/656GpyENJ4XNYbUjDAhzyTRVka0.png","name":"Red Lion","origin_country":"LU"},{"id":163910,"logo_path":null,"name":"Joli Rideau Media","origin_country":"LU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LU","name":"Luxembourg"}],"release_date":"2022-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Invitation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2364621,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fabrizio Maltese","original_name":"Fabrizio Maltese","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622dd3f40e4419001b69beec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2364621,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fabrizio Maltese","original_name":"Fabrizio Maltese","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622dd3fbcddbbc001cab0036","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1673383,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Qutaiba Barhamji","original_name":"Qutaiba Barhamji","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/aheT581Gakc8CHOcG6xEDNVCBUA.jpg","credit_id":"622dd40f2a210c00784aae5f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2554070,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Arnaud Mellet","original_name":"Arnaud Mellet","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622dd417cddbbc001cab008f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3463832,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Emre Sevindik","original_name":"Emre Sevindik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622dd41f2866fa001b4da851","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1210758,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeanne Geiben","original_name":"Jeanne Geiben","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622dd42dcdbaff0078506fa7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3463833,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fabrizio Maltese","original_name":"Fabrizio Maltese","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622dd43db04605001ce48410","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11719504","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ja2vWhHn3oET6p8AD0c9ZkCTR5D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":864}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
