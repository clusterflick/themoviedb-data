Born in 1935, Parviz Yahaghi, was a regular on the radio show 'Golha' from a young age. Several pre-revolutionary singers such as Mahasti, Homeira and Marzieh became famous for his songs, and with the sound of his violin, many fell in love with Iranian music. He became isolated after the victory of the revolution, although his music was never isolated. Parviz Yahaghi died in February of 2007. The film looks at his life in his own words and in the last years of his life.","popularity":0.0796,"poster_path":"/go4tkmDXY8ypI6FjJlSqX4j7zDQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2010-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Concert that was not Performed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3467583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Parviz Yahaghi","original_name":"Parviz Yahaghi","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/oqT06vhGJCiyOXgaXNuqegXm4It.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"6231b950befd91001b1ecdad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1891301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ahmad Reza Ahmadi","original_name":"Ahmad Reza Ahmadi","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/qFd2wuxBuxliipxlHQVXWj6MPER.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6231b95c9ac535001b10e0fb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3467585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Homeyra","original_name":"Homeyra","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/i51VkwDbH3HLuN8CgqTzIOvzH7i.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6231b972fcadb40046fc9612","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081566,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bahman Farmanara","original_name":"Bahman Farmanara","popularity":0.0636,"profile_path":"/yb1J03NkD1P71M8Nh8Ohgctbe56.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6231b97d3c3ab0001ee1e168","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3467586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bijan Taraghi","original_name":"Bijan Taraghi","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/2EuFgXNFwa1fCYe8jj3jwTxVrUE.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6231b98cbefd910074c73655","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081566,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bahman Farmanara","original_name":"Bahman Farmanara","popularity":0.0636,"profile_path":"/yb1J03NkD1P71M8Nh8Ohgctbe56.jpg","credit_id":"6231a244befd910074c70b41","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081566,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bahman Farmanara","original_name":"Bahman Farmanara","popularity":0.0636,"profile_path":"/yb1J03NkD1P71M8Nh8Ohgctbe56.jpg","credit_id":"6231a24b9ac5350045d6dd0f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1174330,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Abbas Ganjavi","original_name":"Abbas Ganjavi","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6231b9ab71458f00717e5b95","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3467583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Parviz Yahaghi","original_name":"Parviz Yahaghi","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/oqT06vhGJCiyOXgaXNuqegXm4It.jpg","credit_id":"6231b9b5da10f00072cc1eea","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2597364,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Davoud Amiri","original_name":"Davoud Amiri","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6231ba760582240045b1d962","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1563440,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bahman Kiarostami","original_name":"Bahman Kiarostami","popularity":0.0844,"profile_path":"/8fuckijhQ5ERfQV4wXEHV9bsuiT.jpg","credit_id":"6231ba80befd9100447df413","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/go4tkmDXY8ypI6FjJlSqX4j7zDQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
