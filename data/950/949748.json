Conceptually arranged in to a film “album”, Lion’s seven works navigate atomic fallout and a girl’s adolescence, a dream before death, radiation as a cause and cure for cancer, masculine bravado, feminine obsession, a trip to Chernobyl amongst the death of a matriarch, and the destruction of memory. Composed of seven works, Lion is a series of films created on 16mm and hand processed with darkroom techniques that mimic the effects of radiation on film. Researched in Chernobyl, the series is a product of memories, history, pop culture and technical experiments to create visual representations of invisible forces.","popularity":0.085,"poster_path":"/5rN9toODPtzyi1rIzmyZaaMcDFp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lion","video":false,"vote_average":7.143,"vote_count":14,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1786572,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel McIntyre","original_name":"Daniel McIntyre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623095eecc9683001ca8eacf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5rN9toODPtzyi1rIzmyZaaMcDFp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
