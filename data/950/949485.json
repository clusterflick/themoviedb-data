And this is the only recording of James in concert as of 1979. It captures the charismatic and masterful Taylor in a performance highlighted by his sweet, soulful vocals, musical virtuosity, and disarmingly enchanting stage presence. Backed up by a tight, polished band comprised of a stellar cast of musicians (many of whom have played and recorded with Taylor for years) James delivers powerful renditions of his classics \"Sweet Baby James;' \"Carolina On My Mind;' \"Blossom',' and \"Steamroller:' The band features Don Grolnick on keyboards, Danny Kortchmar and Waddy Watchel on guitars, Leland Sklar on bass, David Sanborn on saxophone, and David Lasley and Arnold McCuller on back-up vocals. Superbly shot on a beautiful summer day at the Blossom Music Center in 1979.","popularity":0.2912,"poster_path":"/iJDeSCG89oikYsg39qDdiEKvgdK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1979-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"James Taylor in Concert","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97351,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Taylor","original_name":"James Taylor","popularity":0.3996,"profile_path":"/z2cFkO0XP2zXXdlVK97WOY2nZBC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"622f87e00ff15a0045d84e49","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iJDeSCG89oikYsg39qDdiEKvgdK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1979-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"James Taylor 'In Concert' (Blossom Music Center 1979)","key":"Q-kpZzBd500","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2018-04-08T22:42:54.000Z","id":"622f8857e04aca0045a20431"}]}}}
