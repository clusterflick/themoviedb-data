It tells the story of one's battle with self-love through black-and-white imagery. After being cast in the lead role of a professional ballet, Ragan is pressured by the ballet’s director to lighten her skin with make-up, in order to be consistent with the white dancers on stage. She reluctantly goes along with the request, but with each performance in the lighter make-up, she feels more degraded. When a young adoring fan tells her she wants to be just like her, the dancer cannot continue to perform feeling such shame. She makes a decision to be authentic, and dance freely, in her own skin.","popularity":0.2295,"poster_path":"/iEYuYk7Wn1RjQdbKKXxG3XN45tM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How far would you go to take a bow?","title":"En Avant","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1759686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toi'ya Leatherwood","original_name":"Toi'ya Leatherwood","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/qU1u6TozUn6DnMh1A69sopL7Vz1.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ragan","credit_id":"6657855e9261da593a1a1499","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1360049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Scott Allen","original_name":"Kevin Scott Allen","popularity":0.1103,"profile_path":"/jveOKi01kDhvPHUWek4pvLZvKLD.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Leon","credit_id":"6657856ace948be64e2d19d5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4743175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalya James Washington","original_name":"Natalya James Washington","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Bailey","credit_id":"66578578a27ef5ac98b92401","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4743176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noraye Gardiner","original_name":"Noraye Gardiner","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Young Ragan","credit_id":"66578586fee66effb5e4e9a0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4743177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katie O'Gara","original_name":"Katie O'Gara","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Core Dancer #1","credit_id":"66578593bf4e331d736bf851","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4743178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Van Citters","original_name":"Emily Van Citters","popularity":0.1276,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Core Dancer #2","credit_id":"665785a072cb389dd61a135c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4743179,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eliza S.
