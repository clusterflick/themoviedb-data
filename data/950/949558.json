In 2012, 34 striking mineworkers were murdered by South African State Police in what was the most deadly day of state repression since the country's new constitution in 1994. The news of the killings rocked the country, leading to a year with more protests and actions the country hadn't seen since the end of Apartheid.  The film explores how the mineral wealth -rightfully belonging to the people of South Africa- has been sold to foreign capitalist interests for the enrichment of a few elite individuals – and how traditional communities have been divided in this process.  The story is told through a number of key characters who drive the narrative. From a mineworker who survived the Marikana massacre, to artists, community activists, union leaders, and lawyers.","popularity":0.2082,"poster_path":"/e5yhtiagvHQVWXKTI0ngUGIiZEd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Lives Matter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","title":"Black Lives Matter: South Africa's Democracy Up in Flames","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3465800,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Oesi","original_name":"Joseph Oesi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622fbda28fdda9007326df64","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5927530","wikidata_id":"Q26912942","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1333,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e5yhtiagvHQVWXKTI0ngUGIiZEd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Black Lives Matter: South Africa’s Democracy Up In Flames (OFFICIAL TRAILER) | Means TV","key":"E64gHppOuTo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-10-23T23:28:29.000Z","id":"622fbe2f2866fa008082d614"}]}}}
