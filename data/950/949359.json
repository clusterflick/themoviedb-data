San Francisco is aglow with chance for a young artist from China, and Shi-Wei recasts her life in the new openness she finds in the West. She surrenders herself to sensual curiosity with a white acquaintance. But what about her longing for her boyfriend in China, who impulsively decides to join her in America \"to be with you, to struggle next to you side-by-side\"? As she embraces one intimate tie and resumes another, Shi-Wei is entwined in the clutter of love and need.
