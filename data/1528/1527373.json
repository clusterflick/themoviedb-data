Egon, who lost his father and sister when he was a boy and began to feel the shadow of death strongly, continued to draw numerous self-portraits in an attempt to discover who he really was. Egon enters the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts with his younger sister Gerti, but his radical style causes him to be glared at by the art world and the police.
