As a result, August is placed in cryogenic freeze and launched into space, preserving their life until a future time when the condition might be treatable.  Unbeknownst to them, drastic changes occur on their home planet during their frozen state, leading to the extinction of human life there and the emergence of new prominent species. After drifting for an unknown duration in space, a fortuitous collision with an asteroid dislodges August's pod, bringing them back to their long-lost home where they wash up on what is now Skilipea Island.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ho6FxINOigw9avb5caktbanYRkY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Solar Neighbor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ho6FxINOigw9avb5caktbanYRkY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
