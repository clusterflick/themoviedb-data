In 1948 the Israeli army destroyed the village and forced residents to move. In 1972, residents were allowed to return to the village and build their home within a month. Legend has it that the village was rebuilt in one night. Today the inhabitants depend almost entirely on agriculture for their livelihood and struggle daily to access their lands. But the danger is looming and the village could disappear again at any time.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Is My Village","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5615360,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cristiano Regina","original_name":"Cristiano Regina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6896b1ad0a8f4e6f092c0b7a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5615362,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dimi Kaza","original_name":"Dimi Kaza","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6896b1c182e345af9092e906","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
