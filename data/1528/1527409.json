This quiet detail unfolds into a layered meditation on colonialism—U.S. occupation, forced migration, environmental crisis, and political abandonment. Through voice and image, the film traces the ways Puerto Ricans are made to drift in and out of their homeland, caught between memory and imposed distance. The “floating island” becomes both a metaphor and a reality: always tethered, never fully free. - re:assemblage collective","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Isla Flotante","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5615498,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jezabeth Roca González","original_name":"Jezabeth Roca González","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6896caa189fa8b0a05267535","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
