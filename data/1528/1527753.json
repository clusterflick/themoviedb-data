Three friends set out across NYC on January 11, the date Conner O'Malley and Danny Schararâ€™s 2024 film Rap World takes place, to celebrate its screening and the shared delirium of filmgoing as lifestyle. Shot on camcorder and steeped in homage, the film blurs diary, homage, and fan tribute with cameos from James N. Kienitz Wilkins and Conner O'Malley. Cinephilia as community, ritual, and handheld devotion.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/3Qb3Q32omGAU2ljpWyBmkfv2WeR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"One Movie.
