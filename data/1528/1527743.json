Loosely based on the real-life anomaly that captivated the town of St. Augustine over a century ago, this historical fiction reimagines the enduring myth through a contemporary lens. Blending folklore with personal observations, the film explores the boundaries of monstrosity—what we fear, what we fabricate, and what that reveals about us. Set against the lush backdrop of wild Florida landscapes and the unknowable depths of the ocean, Florida Monster reflects on the strangeness of the human condition and our ever-shifting relationship with the unknown.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Florida Monster","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
