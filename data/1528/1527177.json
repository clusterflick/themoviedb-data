In search of understanding, she begins speaking with strangers who’ve also lost someone close. The conversations aren’t tearful ones, they’re charged with frustration. Reflecting on her journey, Elizabeth revisits her old home videos, as it is the only way she can still hear her mom’s voice. In the end, she speaks with her dad and shares what she has discovered about grief with others.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/yWqLuwc47y1XhpLC3KQNtxCzmua.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life is But a Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5323434,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elizabeth Kallies","original_name":"Elizabeth Kallies","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/jBTfVmz4hAqrT7ojbidmGzQjThC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Elizabeth Kallies","credit_id":"68962f6a755a57e7982c0912","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5614439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Kallies","original_name":"Michael Kallies","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Michael Kallies","credit_id":"68962fa8f61ad47e405d05c2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5614440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isobel Lyman","original_name":"Isobel Lyman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Isobel Lyman","credit_id":"68962fc680f5d0efceb6f403","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5614442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma DeZarn","original_name":"Emma DeZarn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Emma DeZarn","credit_id":"68962fd296e18cafc4c4b2eb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5614443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie Ogilvie","original_name":"Charlie Ogilvie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Charlie Ogilvie","credit_id":"68962fdec257d220dab6f413","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5614445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Oliver","original_name":"Lisa Oliver","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Lisa Oliver","credit_id":"68962fea02c08aa002561dbd","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5323434,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elizabeth Kallies","original_name":"Elizabeth Kallies","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/jBTfVmz4hAqrT7ojbidmGzQjThC.jpg","credit_id":"68962f96b6edef11308d9f41","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yWqLuwc47y1XhpLC3KQNtxCzmua.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9872,"name":"grief"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
