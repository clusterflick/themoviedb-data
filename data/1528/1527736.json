When Prima, the fussy Indian ring-necked parakeet has the notion that there may be bluer skies on the other side of Paradise island, she flies off and ruffles feathers of all residents of the birdhouse. Has Prima gone to live happily ever after in birdie bliss, or fill the fears of her wise brother Anakhan, the palm cockatoo, become a sad reality? With a heartwarming story inspired by “The Birds in My Life” Supreme Master Ching Hai’s #1 international best-selling book; memorable musical numbers; and the exquisite, detailed artistry of award-winning animators, “Birds of Paradise” will have the spirits of all audiences soaring on the wings of love.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/tzidyvShvaWfEnlJOEdPEG7wo1F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":269651,"logo_path":null,"name":"Supreme Master Television","origin_country":""},{"id":270667,"logo_path":null,"name":"Supreme Master Ching Hai International Association","origin_country":"TW"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2015-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Just Winging It","title":"Birds of Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5616644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Kramer","original_name":"Chris Kramer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Sunny / Gentino (voice)","credit_id":"6897b7ea1c3e7e26bdb6f86c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":151320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philece Sampler","original_name":"Philece Sampler","popularity":0.8731,"profile_path":"/ixpsNGJUyZqfvvjY4WAf9Ak6CRm.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Prima (voice)","credit_id":"6897b7fbb8a9d066e48ea7d9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5616648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elise Lopez","original_name":"Elise Lopez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mimi / Tutu / Kadula (voice)","credit_id":"6897b811b6edef11308da378","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5616649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Dooley","original_name":"Patrick Dooley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Mirabeau (voice)","credit_id":"6897b825023b4acb8826785f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":172843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"L.
