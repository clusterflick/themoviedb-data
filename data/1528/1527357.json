Combining touching, personal stories with experimental research on the history of twentieth-century art and architecture, the film creates both a compelling narrative, and a contemporary aesthetic of panel-block mass housing using original watercolors, put into motion using digital animation and stop-motion techniques. As global and personal histories interweave, the film explores notions of moral and political responsibility as evinced in physical space.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/eyd6WfH1lXXTNHpuPrAegMslT6Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Empathy for Concrete Things","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2281860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gregory Gan","original_name":"Gregory Gan","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68968e7c8aaeac443c8da01b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2281860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gregory Gan","original_name":"Gregory Gan","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68968f2f5650478ecdc4b472","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2281860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gregory Gan","original_name":"Gregory Gan","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68968f62a1ebf014ce267574","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1977404,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dina Velikovskaya","original_name":"Dina Velikovskaya","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68968f6c993a5e97772674a6","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2051324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne Isensee","original_name":"Anne Isensee","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68968f7fe83c1edf79e24202","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1705776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Florian Grolig","original_name":"Florian Grolig","popularity":0.0993,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68968f8aa1ebf014ce267577","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2982359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Artem Funk","original_name":"Artem Funk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68968fbd023b4acb882674fb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2982359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Artem Funk","original_name":"Artem Funk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68968fce827424b39be242b4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2281860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gregory Gan","original_name":"Gregory Gan","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68968fda65b31e37cf8ea53f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2281860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gregory Gan","original_name":"Gregory Gan","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68968fe06b2240b2d1561e58","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5615184,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Olesya Sergeeva","original_name":"Olesya Sergeeva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68968ff39638ed98ede24362","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30140972","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4pYDu6qaV0jmtrSPqY7JHXTuzsg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ncMjv6znTmm5nbgkriQfJth3QxK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1s7QN1yU6X0nJhXBpg1ZCVMgVtd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8UPzzJs9g12af4u5mQ7gcXVrqdc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/skumP4zjyAVO67Kn3FlJhWWJfJg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eyd6WfH1lXXTNHpuPrAegMslT6Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlin","release_date":"2023-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
