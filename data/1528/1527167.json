Told entirely through authentic raw footage of security cameras, cellphone videos, and emergency response clips, the film unfolds in real time, as shoppers and hostage takers collide in the mall's corridors. Without voiceover or interviews, the documentary relies on visual rhythm and cinematic pacing to build suspense. Each shot escalates tension: the initial confusion, the sudden eruption of violence, the terror-stricken faces of those hiding or fleeing, and the harrowing moments of police and rescue intervention. The editing stitches these fragments into a seamless timeline that immerses the audience in the unfolding crisis. Instead of explanatory narration, viewers are placed in the shoes of those trapped, feeling their fear, disorientation, and hope, all unfolding in \"real time","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/uziLb3W8VlOnclT1Lhizc8PQN1l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":270565,"logo_path":"/uhw4Kq1maJ1zGcJukkGijQ9prH0.png","name":"Lohkast Pictures","origin_country":"KE"},{"id":270566,"logo_path":"/4oplIe92VmeEMEYXhdSbQrNIHC.png","name":"Lohkast","origin_country":"KE"},{"id":270567,"logo_path":"/v6MrqBwY85FkzLnbnQpK5KRqCSF.png","name":"Lohkast Audio","origin_country":"KE"},{"id":270569,"logo_path":"/5vAXnx5AA3eJ7fZEOurZS8LRyws.png","name":"Lohkast Records","origin_country":"KE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KE","name":"Kenya"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swahili","iso_639_1":"sw","name":"Kiswahili"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Weekend in Hell","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3740043,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Ongige","original_name":"James Ongige","popularity":0.2416,"profile_path":"/gtOC2F6GlmP7WPOtoBQzCeGzWe6.jpg","credit_id":"68963fed53a197e6e2e241b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3740043,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Ongige","original_name":"James Ongige","popularity":0.2416,"profile_path":"/gtOC2F6GlmP7WPOtoBQzCeGzWe6.jpg","credit_id":"6896401046798eb963c4b33b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3740043,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Ongige","original_name":"James Ongige","popularity":0.2416,"profile_path":"/gtOC2F6GlmP7WPOtoBQzCeGzWe6.jpg","credit_id":"6896403603e0cf5c80c4b354","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3740043,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Ongige","original_name":"James Ongige","popularity":0.2416,"profile_path":"/gtOC2F6GlmP7WPOtoBQzCeGzWe6.jpg","credit_id":"689640693300a55636561dcf","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3740043,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Ongige","original_name":"James Ongige","popularity":0.2416,"profile_path":"/gtOC2F6GlmP7WPOtoBQzCeGzWe6.jpg","credit_id":"68964156f61ad47e405d0621","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3740043,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Ongige","original_name":"James Ongige","popularity":0.2416,"profile_path":"/gtOC2F6GlmP7WPOtoBQzCeGzWe6.jpg","credit_id":"689641755d3761d8fb8da006","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3740043,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Ongige","original_name":"James Ongige","popularity":0.2416,"profile_path":"/gtOC2F6GlmP7WPOtoBQzCeGzWe6.jpg","credit_id":"689641b83b2be8256b8ea41f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3740043,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Ongige","original_name":"James Ongige","popularity":0.2416,"profile_path":"/gtOC2F6GlmP7WPOtoBQzCeGzWe6.jpg","credit_id":"68964260cbea66507a8d9fc0","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3740043,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Ongige","original_name":"James Ongige","popularity":0.2416,"profile_path":"/gtOC2F6GlmP7WPOtoBQzCeGzWe6.jpg","credit_id":"68964c5f4328ba14b8c4b373","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3740043,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Ongige","original_name":"James Ongige","popularity":0.2416,"profile_path":"/gtOC2F6GlmP7WPOtoBQzCeGzWe6.jpg","credit_id":"68964c77c16efb3ae22c09cd","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37660758","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jIqZFLW0Y2ZiBxCrfp1iJ1hdTv5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1921},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2vmNlMD2jxr0mkuRMYoNEw1eR32.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1921},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k7msN243dGIjik1aDO8jVqz3gpu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uziLb3W8VlOnclT1Lhizc8PQN1l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":325825,"name":"horrified"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
