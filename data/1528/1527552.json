It was a journey back to her beginnings. \"It's a wonderful coincidence that young German film also began at this time.\" For Iris Berben, the re-watching of \"Supergirl\" became a melancholy look back, in which she observed herself as a young actress in the role of the mysterious alien Francesca Farnese as well as seeing all her colleagues again, including above all Marquard Bohm (1941-2006), this \"wonderful madman\", with whom she had already played in her first feature film \"Detektive\" (1969), also directed by Rudolf Thome.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":270632,"logo_path":"/mAMcSXpWfnAkQsK6DO0GIi1LkJm.png","name":"alleskino.de","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Supergirl: Iris Berben im Gespräch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":43451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iris Berben","original_name":"Iris Berben","popularity":2.3066,"profile_path":"/qj03SCM8eARHkbxyEjBzZIAAiqv.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"689744c9b9a38b9ec6c4b6fb","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5615872,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Horst Peter Koll","original_name":"Horst Peter Koll","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689744e2404b91859db6f716","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5615872,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Horst Peter Koll","original_name":"Horst Peter Koll","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689744e7d08758ca0e267845","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5615872,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Horst Peter Koll","original_name":"Horst Peter Koll","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689744f0a2918d7dec8da237","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36106,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"David Slama","original_name":"David Slama","popularity":0.4125,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68974500755a57e7982c0d21","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
