Bozhena, fleeing the war, found refuge in Truskavets, where she became the voice of children who, like her, had lost their homes. Marko and Maria live in Kryvyi Rih under constant shelling, but they continue to fight: the boy is learning to accept his history through creativity, and the girl is actively involved in community activities and building her future in Ukraine. Anna from Kharkiv dreams of becoming an architect and rebuilding her hometown. Veronika, who survived the occupation of Chernihiv, is healing through equestrian sports, and Valeria, whose parents took her to Germany, is still looking for an answer — whether to return or build a future abroad.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/Y2qArCQH6IsNzc43Oyi50G6CJ8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2025-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Generation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1315345,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marysia Nikitiuk","original_name":"Marysia Nikitiuk","popularity":0.4293,"profile_path":"/9QfP6Ewl6BjBoSAZ3TJFid5vfcb.jpg","credit_id":"68962c04d08758ca0e2673b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1272,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/Y2qArCQH6IsNzc43Oyi50G6CJ8.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":848}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Mykolaichuk OPEN Audience Film Festival","release_date":"2025-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"«Покоління» — фільм благодійного фонду «Голоси дітей» та Марисі Нікітюк (трейлер, ENG SUB)","key":"Nbmdkw3ntm8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-02-28T09:09:57.000Z","id":"68962c4e2dcdbf1f246d5fb7"}]}}}
