The openings into and through the wall become larger, and then become smaller again (so small as to seem semblances of stars at times). Finally the enlargements take over the scene and eventually demolish all sense of \"wall\". This film is very inspired by the paintings of Gunther Forg, and with respect to St. John of the Cross, is a hand painted envisionment of holy depression.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/tmyjHtlNoM4DWWDMpShXnT085lO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dark Night of The Soul","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Brakhage","original_name":"Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg","credit_id":"561be24ac3a368225e0016e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0313954","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tmyjHtlNoM4DWWDMpShXnT085lO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
