Part of the \"Vancouver Island\" films. \"Purple flashes are followed by a curtain of purple and blues, first seemingly static and then in motion. Close-ups of textures of paint evolve into flashes of jewel-like red, then more cascading blues and purples and white - 'falling,' seemingly, down from the top of the screen, at other times multi-directional bursts of rolling colors. Red, blue and yellow course through in an up-down motion, then blues and yellows enter from left and right in a complex medley of not solidly formed, but very vibrant pulsations of color, at times only slightly hinting at a solidity of \"wallness\" upon which the paint might exist. But it is a \"wall\" suffused with light.\" - Marilyn Brakhage","popularity":0.0393,"poster_path":"/Afrl62aPP4cDvIXbQNvJuL4jAYa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Panels for the Walls of Heaven","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Brakhage","original_name":"Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg","credit_id":"561be30a9251415a6b001752","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0351530","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.783,"height":729,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2DtmKpEKpOpGiLDJElQiJ0mpkxF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1300},{"aspect_ratio":1.783,"height":729,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kGjvTKscMT4EW9gYmqZRnEzp0OD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1300},{"aspect_ratio":1.783,"height":729,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jJf2GO1Jyc3iixoAgPF676neuta.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1300},{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":730,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/avncdyZZJqzcuret0Do65nKcYGI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1300}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1168,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/Afrl62aPP4cDvIXbQNvJuL4jAYa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":778},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6fgvjZ891jUD1Hb88I1u9CblnRU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dmiJzjHLKgQ7h3PGdu8tn7FRNs8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9VI8DuwlZdD8AKwfD2Hx1xgNnWm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uKbSCfhbEdrUZyHulI6u0TiKTH5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-12-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
