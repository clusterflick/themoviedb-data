Most of the land-owners of California were the descendants of the Dons who had colonized it a hundred years before and whose title deeds bore the signature and seal of a long-dead Spanish king. But, by a loop-hole in the law, the title-deeds of the Dons could not be recognized, and this opened the door of organized gangs of land-grabbers, such as the one led by Joe Kincaid, to operate with a prime excuse for legitimate plunder and robbery. In most cases the law was unable to cope with the situation. Then Rosita Castro, the daughter of Don Pasqual Castro, masked and disguised as a man, organized a band of vigilantes to fight against the tyranny of the outlaws, aided by an undercover federal agent, Jim Kearney.","popularity":1.207,"poster_path":"/uDrgd8HYo446to8A02cLYSWqJUQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1936-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"THE MYSTERY BANDIT...A Drama of Old Mexico","title":"Rose of the Rancho","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Boles","original_name":"John Boles","popularity":0.1812,"profile_path":"/eVu8Tzdi3UYrCApUW221CSXoAHt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jim Kearney","credit_id":"5616039e92514126dd001540","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1295625,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gladys Swarthout","original_name":"Gladys Swarthout","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/f0XumpZcehbhKPJYmyxPYMwy9LD.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Rosita Castro aka Don Carlos","credit_id":"561603a8c3a3680433000f87","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Bickford","original_name":"Charles Bickford","popularity":0.6004,"profile_path":"/eIHzgOkNyenH8HXezzsH056RTXd.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Joe Kincaid","credit_id":"561603b2c3a368681001eb84","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"H.B.
