This is all from a film by Jean-Marie Straub – about fate, the soul and the cosmos, about the evident nature in which man lives, just like in the aquarium surrounding him. And finally, there’s the nation as a symbol for the community of free people. A Straub film represents a gift that isn’t based on exchange, but rather the opposite of communication. And what could be more beautiful and liberating in life?","popularity":0.1789,"poster_path":"/jKJO4WHR3CYpy9CQyFWjvJlymmo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73467,"logo_path":"/2ShpO35d9Sja9UzdEzDtBk7DaQf.png","name":"Andolfi","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":98752,"logo_path":null,"name":"Belva Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2015-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L’Aquarium et la Nation","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1945588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aimé Agnel","original_name":"Aimé Agnel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5a3b17920e0a265f7701cc87","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1945589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christiane Veschambre","original_name":"Christiane Veschambre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5a3b1798c3a368148f08da92","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Marie Straub","original_name":"Jean-Marie Straub","popularity":0.1045,"profile_path":"/y6a7HQ2UK12p5bhP90KbRvu3mX.jpg","credit_id":"64ef535b77d23b012e89744f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Marie Straub","original_name":"Jean-Marie Straub","popularity":0.1045,"profile_path":"/y6a7HQ2UK12p5bhP90KbRvu3mX.jpg","credit_id":"56180af9925141375200011e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1206956,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arnaud Dommerc","original_name":"Arnaud Dommerc","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a3b17ca0e0a265f7701ccc8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1206957,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Christophe Clavert","original_name":"Christophe Clavert","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a3b16c30e0a264cca216ce0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1206957,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Christophe Clavert","original_name":"Christophe Clavert","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a3b16dfc3a36814ab09eb73","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":66231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Ulrich","original_name":"Barbara Ulrich","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a3b17d4925141547b093deb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1408831,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Pierre Laforce","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Laforce","popularity":0.0736,"profile_path":"/ywI5sgwVyqvCmHo7NseL1x5tyDr.jpg","credit_id":"5a3b17140e0a264cbc2257df","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1204877,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"André Malraux","original_name":"André Malraux","popularity":0.1078,"profile_path":"/i6DpbO5L5CfAuUnFeqxgpk1CEQ4.jpg","credit_id":"5a3b17b70e0a264cd021e8ae","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1834729,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dimitry Haulet","original_name":"Dimitry Haulet","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a3b16f3925141032c220ba0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1945587,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gaël Blondet","original_name":"Gaël Blondet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a3b1746c3a3680b8821c97f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5966890","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fWu6Ej1h4WteMLWOZif5xJV7DwY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/jKJO4WHR3CYpy9CQyFWjvJlymmo.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/ak2VBAhinJuV4bZAM2KdQSr0SRy.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":525}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
