This is the first find of this magnitude since King Tutankhamun's tomb was uncovered in 1922, according to Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities. Called KV 63 - it is the 63rd discovered since the valley was first mapped - the new, intact tomb was found just 16 feet away from King Tut's resting place. A team of archeologists led by Otto Schaden discovered the tomb by accident while conducting \"routine digs\" on the nearby tomb of King Amenmesses, a 19th Dynasty pharaoh. Explore the wonders of the magnificent lost era.","popularity":0.7004,"poster_path":"/7nWWDdJGFXvOmCuPEsgFaPSRGyw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8172,"logo_path":"/z8wiYrvJAwbm2jcPSj8qVqWh4RP.png","name":"Atlantic Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2006-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Meet one of King Tut's neighbors.","title":"Egypt's New Tomb Revealed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"La última tumba de Egipto","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","title":"Objev nové egyptské hrobky","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","title":"Hrobka faraóna","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zahi Hawass","original_name":"Zahi Hawass","popularity":0.1411,"profile_path":"/lDZadqSZrcfDNy79w8nvWZL7cKW.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself (as Dr. Zahi Hawass)","credit_id":"561e5650c3a3686cd600228e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17199,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corey Johnson","original_name":"Corey Johnson","popularity":0.4835,"profile_path":"/mhNbf4vGzixPL5mTIOBUPguqvpB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"561e568c9251410d8f0020b7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2177331,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Earl Ertman","original_name":"Earl Ertman","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself (as Prof. Earl Ertman)","credit_id":"5bf02149c3a36818a503540c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2177333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George B.
