Four long fluorescent lightbulbs horizontally stacked at a slight diagonal pulse with erratic, hypnotic rhythm; a fifth has gone out, disrupting the symmetry. Next, a single bulb appears, positioned at the same angle, and a sudden swell of primitive dance beats rises on the soundtrack, quickly dispelled by the barking of a dog. More fluorescent lights follow, in varying arrangements and states of disrepair—these are the opening images of DRIVE THRU (2006).","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drive Thru","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1522253,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gretchen Skogerson","original_name":"Gretchen Skogerson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"561dc3e192514142b6000d38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
