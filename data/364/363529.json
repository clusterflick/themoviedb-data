Despite their social limitations, both dream of getting married, but straight identifying John refuses to tie the knot until transsexual Martine gets a real vagina. The only problem: no doctor in Canada will perform operation because Martine's obesity makes her too great of a surgical risk. Will Martine and John find the happiness together that they deserve? Transfixed is a deeply human story about love, freedom, and self-actualization.","popularity":0.0746,"poster_path":"/d5XF1uMQDGMlD2FZmp4ReGDSt5w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2015-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"What happens when two people are so unique, so different, that they break every possible convention?","title":"Transfixed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1521556,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Christopher Behnisch","original_name":"Christopher Behnisch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"561aaae6925141077400091c","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1521555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alon Kol","original_name":"Alon Kol","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"561aaad8c3a3683ca1000b06","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4073840","wikidata_id":"Q65055355","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pgZooc4rv6vZQAk9wCrPBo61vgw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1499,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d5XF1uMQDGMlD2FZmp4ReGDSt5w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
