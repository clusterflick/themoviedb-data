The Host sets out on its own exploration, to decipher signs from the fragmented images buried in the BP archive. This journey through the past interweaves a number of stories drawn from both personal memory and the records of an imperial history, which builds a picture of a 20th-century colonial encounter. The Host is a personal essay film about the stories we tell about ourselves and others, the facts and fictions we live by, and their consequences. Followed by a discussion with Miranda Pennell.","popularity":0.3358,"poster_path":"/qqEpczHJfvSH2mgglMqvsw41VBH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Host","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1346741,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miranda Pennell","original_name":"Miranda Pennell","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56159bb39251410d8000f674","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5537146","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qqEpczHJfvSH2mgglMqvsw41VBH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":220191,"name":"artists moving image"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
