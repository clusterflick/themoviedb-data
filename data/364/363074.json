This brilliant ethnographic documentary by renowned filmmakers David and Judith MacDougall captures one particularly riveting discussion one afternoon under the men's tree. The conversation on this particular afternoon becomes a kind of reverse ethnography, centering on the European's most noticeable possession, the motor vehicle. This is a uniquely delicate and intimate film, filled with the humor of the Jie and, implicitly, the ironic wit of the filmmakers.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/nJoXBODzmjgGBHGKelHtzvikayK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1973-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Under the Men's Tree","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1520248,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David MacDougall","original_name":"David MacDougall","popularity":0.0672,"profile_path":"/u6ymKda5rQcMhf93hAx7P64kDDq.jpg","credit_id":"56165a05c3a368682401d1f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1520248,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David MacDougall","original_name":"David MacDougall","popularity":0.0672,"profile_path":"/u6ymKda5rQcMhf93hAx7P64kDDq.jpg","credit_id":"5dc2a878470ead00188c14ab","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1520249,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Judith MacDougall","original_name":"Judith MacDougall","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc2a887a9b9a400111bb203","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":773,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nJoXBODzmjgGBHGKelHtzvikayK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":580}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
