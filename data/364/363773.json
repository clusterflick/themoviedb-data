He departs from Zürich and walks to St. Gallen, the place were he grew up und also the place where he started smoking. On his pilgrimage through Switzerland he hopes to find the root of his addiction and waits for a final catharsis to release him. Time and time again though, his sympathy for other smokers and disdain for goody-goody non-smokers gets in the way. And time after time his nicotine addiction gets the best of him.  His three attempts to quit by walking it off, turn into an expedition of Liechtis home country. He gives a declaration of independence but also a confession of love to Switzerland.","popularity":0.1737,"poster_path":"/dIpUaVmDFfRTsPNP4Vwh496J5VG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108610,"logo_path":null,"name":"Peter Liechti Filmproduktion","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":42145,"logo_path":"/fX8uY3tXWh814PLVqKM0IJEoDPW.png","name":"SRF","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2003-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lucky Jack: Three Attempts to Stop Smoking","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Liechti","original_name":"Peter Liechti","popularity":0.0838,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632ca67915794a0092ed2d2d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Liechti","original_name":"Peter Liechti","popularity":0.0838,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632ca656d95420007cc228e0","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Liechti","original_name":"Peter Liechti","popularity":0.0838,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632ca66c7304b50091db86aa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1972371,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dieter Lengacher","original_name":"Dieter Lengacher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632ca6b4fcec2e007cb5e308","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1741010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norbert Möslang","original_name":"Norbert Möslang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632ca6a355937b0084f80c56","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":71410,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tania Stöcklin","original_name":"Tania Stöcklin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632ca68c15794a0092ed2d37","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Liechti","original_name":"Peter Liechti","popularity":0.0838,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"561d2e7392514177d70005c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0417737","wikidata_id":"Q88873014","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dIpUaVmDFfRTsPNP4Vwh496J5VG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":303226,"name":"artfilm"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
