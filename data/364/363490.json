It is an elegy. The photograph is connected with images that are part of our collective memory: extracts from newsreels of World War II that have been reworked and transformed through various optical and electronic processes. World War II was a condensation of violence (biological and environmental destructions, racism, ethnic clearing, and persecution of people who are different…) and ongoing wars perpetuate that violence. This work is a metaphorical representation of all past, present and future wars. Constructed on the dramatic tension between the violence of wars and the presence of the intersex hermaphroditic “Angel”: Their eyes are bandaged; they are a symbol for difference, having an ambiguous position: observer, witness, victim or judge.","popularity":0.044,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":98567,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eikona","origin_country":""},{"id":98568,"logo_path":null,"name":"A.S.T.A.R.T.I.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Requiem for the 20th Century","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1307595,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Klonaris","original_name":"Maria Klonaris","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/a0KDZkOO7frMCMVPq50CPdzDfii.jpg","credit_id":"561a8670c3a368630d0004d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1307596,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katerina Thomadaki","original_name":"Katerina Thomadaki","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":"/uWHHY6c99Up8DG3J1VtANMQqLZy.jpg","credit_id":"561a868992514111c30028a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1942477,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Spiros Faros","original_name":"Spiros Faros","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a359fc4925141032c1ceb93","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12198300","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":208733,"name":"video art"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
