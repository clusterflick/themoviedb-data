The film stars Colleen Dewhurst and Megan Follows as Molly and Micheline Dushane, a mother and daughter living in a small Northern Ontario town.  Molly is an alcoholic, which creates tension between her and Micheline and inspires Micheline's fantasies of escaping her stifling small-town life.  The cast also includes Gordon Clapp and Debra McGrath as Molly's son and daughter-in-law.  Termini Station was the only film besides the Anne of Green Gables movies in which Follows and Dewhurst worked together.  The film was nominated for six awards at the 11th Genie Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actress nods for both Dewhurst and Follows.
