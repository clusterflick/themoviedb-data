After those events Edward Gierek replaced Władysław Gomułka as party first secretary and promised redical change in style and methods of ruling. Kieślowski shows the skepticism of workers and their attitude to party members. He also pictures conflicts inside the party (PZPR) and usual work in shipyard. The political criticism of this movie made it a target of censorship – it was suspended and cut against the will of director.","popularity":0.2064,"poster_path":"/9vD1cqahjr22RJ7fb87SvpQw8g2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24654,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wytwórnia Filmów Dokumentalnych","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Workers '71: Nothing About Us Without Us","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1126,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Krzysztof Kieślowski","original_name":"Krzysztof Kieślowski","popularity":0.8194,"profile_path":"/zG9JD4kzQHhKJAtMOWbwrEolvun.jpg","credit_id":"561aec93c3a3685bfe001f7b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1137915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomasz Zygadło","original_name":"Tomasz Zygadło","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":"/490Tf6dr8NSowHwXla0OylCJJXk.jpg","credit_id":"6658d8a1cd22f2f92e74eb82","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1126,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Krzysztof Kieślowski","original_name":"Krzysztof Kieślowski","popularity":0.8194,"profile_path":"/zG9JD4kzQHhKJAtMOWbwrEolvun.jpg","credit_id":"6658dac509a371848c2d2963","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1378,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jacek Petrycki","original_name":"Jacek Petrycki","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6658daf24446eef9fa74ec78","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1545042,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jacek Szymanski","original_name":"Jacek Szymanski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6658db02d8f807cefa506875","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2546062,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anna Maria Czołnik","original_name":"Anna Maria Czołnik","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6658db252004bb194f2d3210","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1137915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomasz Zygadło","original_name":"Tomasz Zygadło","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":"/490Tf6dr8NSowHwXla0OylCJJXk.jpg","credit_id":"6658dacf9ef4718ae693ef90","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1392,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Witold Stok","original_name":"Witold Stok","popularity":0.0605,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6658dadb68635a7fb174eb3d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4745391,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alina Hojnacka","original_name":"Alina Hojnacka","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6658db0b2004bb194f2d320c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":929316,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lidia Zonn","original_name":"Lidia Zonn","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/6OcWGe5AJfAqjflVZZyFIa96yTV.jpg","credit_id":"6658db15dd28a2224e93f6a2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4431170,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wojciech Szczęsny","original_name":"Wojciech Szczęsny","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6658db42512f151cfa93f116","department":"Production","job":"Production Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3370172,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Stanislaw Mroziuk","original_name":"Stanislaw Mroziuk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6658dae6d8f807cefa506870","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1837611,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Miroslaw Podolski","original_name":"Miroslaw Podolski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6658db3697b7c5247574eeb7","department":"Production","job":"Production Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0067683","wikidata_id":"Q66105073","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.632,"height":799,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8YkZkxsOMdSmdLcV4ffXy8MZs5U.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":505},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"pl","file_path":"/7DtbHdkGjC6MgvrCdIRv5Wmizyu.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9vD1cqahjr22RJ7fb87SvpQw8g2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pl","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
