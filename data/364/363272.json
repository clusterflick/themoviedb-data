The film follows four mysteriously intertwined lives in Portland, Ore., and Los Angeles: an elderly woman ambivalently embarking on an affair; a mentally unstable man being evicted from his home; a frustrated actor waiting for his breakthrough; and a young female artist forced by a much-desired yet inconveniently-timed pregnancy to reassess the priorities in her life.","popularity":0.0459,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In This Short Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1474775,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Britta Sjogren","original_name":"Britta Sjogren","popularity":0.0796,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56187c1fc3a368245a001208","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0962765","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
