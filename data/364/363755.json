She yearns to return home, but he has disowned his past. After his death, Rhoda ventures to America on her own. She nearly becomes destitute for a lack of money but happens upon some questionable fortune as she takes on the chores of Rosy Taylor after inadvertently finding an envelope with money in it. Rosy had been hired as a housekeeper (thus the money), but has passed away before actually showing up for employment.","popularity":0.1985,"poster_path":"/jltYASOGPID40c5LKljiOxyAr9X.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7486,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ghost of Rosy Taylor","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1127086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Miles Minter","original_name":"Mary Miles Minter","popularity":0.127,"profile_path":"/9iGZ1wyTXBHb4GRIE90dT5wP2zN.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Rhoda Eldridge Sayles","credit_id":"561ce4e49251415a6e00392a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allan Forrest","original_name":"Allan Forrest","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":"/jhGHhMlLlprXT3VBQuvVHFw9Ht1.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jacques Le Clerc","credit_id":"561ce5059251415a67003ae0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Periolat","original_name":"George Periolat","popularity":0.0599,"profile_path":"/jlOUreCPiOjUx7NuuC2ExwDttLH.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Charles Eldridge / Joseph Sayles","credit_id":"561ce51fc3a3682251003da7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1522117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Kluge","original_name":"Emma Kluge","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Mrs. Herriman-Smith","credit_id":"561ce5509251415a620036cd","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1408733,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elizabeth Mahoney","original_name":"Elizabeth Mahoney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"561ce4949251411e65001a45","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1522115,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joseph Daskam Bacon","original_name":"Joseph Daskam Bacon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"561ce47ac3a368225e0035c8","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104016,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward Sloman","original_name":"Edward Sloman","popularity":0.1078,"profile_path":"/8NpMGdBGVMvZOzig3Jj3dwvRRQM.jpg","credit_id":"561ce441c3a3682264003702","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37362,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henry King","original_name":"Henry King","popularity":0.3557,"profile_path":"/bJpytCyMCSpoM3wlN8ZkeqZlr2b.jpg","credit_id":"561ce45dc3a368225e0035c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30192,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ira H.
