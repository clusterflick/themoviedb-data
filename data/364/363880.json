Terrestrial is in part an attempt to articulate a desire to transcend bodily limits with things like mobile devices and machines etc. while acknowledging an unavoidable level of dysfunction.The film was inspired by an incident in 2014 where a Blue Line train in Chicago failed to stop at its final destination, the O’Hare airport, and eventually came to a stop halfway up the escalator at the airport’s entrance. Terrestrial reimagines this crash as an earthbound machine’s failed takeoff.”—Calum Michel Walter","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Terrestrial","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Calum Walter","original_name":"Calum Walter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"565906c9c3a36857da000b8e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
