Written between his biggest Broadway successes— On the Town in 1944 and Candide and West Side Story in 1956 and 1957, respectively— Trouble in Tahiti draws upon popular songs styles to deliver an uncompromising critique of post-war American materialism. Beneath the couple's marital discord is a profound longing for love and intimacy. Their spiritual emptiness, in contrast to a veneer of happy consumerism, creates the heart of the drama and is emphasized by sudden stylistic shifts in the music.","popularity":0.2755,"poster_path":"/l2LFbqUqYD3YWQ63SSyMw9pOlzU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":4775,"logo_path":"/z1HSU7AQ04jeOICLE1mBzEJxiEJ.png","name":"Opus Arte","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trouble in Tahiti","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1521069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Daymond","original_name":"Karl Daymond","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"56190537c3a36824410025d2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1521070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephanie Novacek","original_name":"Stephanie Novacek","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Dinah","credit_id":"5619054a92514137500022d3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Randle","original_name":"Tom Randle","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":"/kJRFJpKb4QEo8ovJCOguDjzT7Je.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Gardener / Male Chorus","credit_id":"5aad68db92514116ba015bb7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1521071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Hegarty","original_name":"Mary Hegarty","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Female chorus","credit_id":"561905ee92514137500022ea","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9851,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leonard Bernstein","original_name":"Leonard Bernstein","popularity":0.4622,"profile_path":"/gIcYeEYui0CVZ3eDE26iKUeDX6K.jpg","credit_id":"561906259251413757002563","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1521072,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Daniel","original_name":"Paul Daniel","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/6j2w3nXsisCOhzAE3bj1QbAiv50.jpg","credit_id":"6584c65998f1f10a3a0a1257","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9851,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leonard Bernstein","original_name":"Leonard Bernstein","popularity":0.4622,"profile_path":"/gIcYeEYui0CVZ3eDE26iKUeDX6K.jpg","credit_id":"6584c6845ca7040953f55295","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3298831,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Tom Cairns","original_name":"Tom Cairns","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6584c61643cd5408e83bcdff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0362256","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1088,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l2LFbqUqYD3YWQ63SSyMw9pOlzU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":725}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
