While based relatively closely on historical characters and events, the opera’s central scene is fictional: the highly emotional meeting of the queens that concludes the first act (originally invented by Schiller) never took place. It’s a dramatic device that brilliantly highlights the two women’s contrasting characters.","popularity":0.0877,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":153,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maria Stuarda","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1202406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonia Ganassi","original_name":"Sonia Ganassi","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/AnBgLKGrOXqmYQCc6vCtrjVXUaN.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Elisabetta","credit_id":"561f1c94c3a3680e20001bda","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":485620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Calleja","original_name":"Joseph Calleja","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/3ElrV7iefsTnkH642MgPk7pp367.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Leicester","credit_id":"561f1caa92514171cd001a96","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1383469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Riccardo Zanellato","original_name":"Riccardo Zanellato","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/lL1cLRwiPNVPYaKXv4tyBP9Zk0i.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Talbot","credit_id":"561f1ce192514171da00199a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1522584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marzio Giossi","original_name":"Marzio Giossi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Lord Cecil","credit_id":"561f1cf6c3a3680e16001833","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1522586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cinzia Rizzoni","original_name":"Cinzia Rizzoni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Anna Kennedy","credit_id":"561f1d1cc3a3680e1600183f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1522587,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cinzia Rizzoni","original_name":"Cinzia Rizzoni","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Anna Kennedy","credit_id":"561f1d87c3a3680e10001a78","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1522588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmela Remigio","original_name":"Carmela Remigio","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Maria Stuarda","credit_id":"561f1d9c92514171c7001a20","order":6}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0436571","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
