A recent immigrant to the U.S, Tejpreet is reluctant to embrace her new American identity. In contrast, her husband celebrates everything that mildly reeks of America. On America’s most patriotic holiday, the fourth of July, they have a threatening racist encounter that crushes the Sikh man’s enthusiastic spirit. Witnessing her husband’s devastation, Tejpreet makes a choice against hate and turns the situation around, if only momentarily.","popularity":0.1592,"poster_path":"/tNj7DN2vvZzyA3snhcG05HMi9qD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54929,"logo_path":null,"name":"Independent Film","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Dear Americans","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1521917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gugun Deep Singh","original_name":"Gugun Deep Singh","popularity":0.1948,"profile_path":"/q7OdKd8p6AB6CwvSGKTcLYbYLN1.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Baldev Singh","credit_id":"561c46ea9251415a6700282e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1521918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ansuya Nathan","original_name":"Ansuya Nathan","popularity":0.1143,"profile_path":"/hoGyh4b70JiGUeDI3cjpfxncXNc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tejpreet Kaur Singh","credit_id":"561c46fdc3a3682261002350","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1521922,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Grant Fonda","original_name":"Grant Fonda","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ca2fd966ae4d002b853c69","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":552026,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Susumu Kimura","original_name":"Susumu Kimura","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ca2fed773941005789426a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1521919,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arpita Kumar","original_name":"Arpita Kumar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"561c47119251411e6500080b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1521919,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arpita Kumar","original_name":"Arpita Kumar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"561c47189251415a620023c7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1521920,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Minnie Chen","original_name":"Minnie Chen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"561c4725c3a3682256002682","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1521921,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Meena Singh","original_name":"Meena Singh","popularity":0.2302,"profile_path":"/lM7SstQTefciPJORyGyTz89Icer.jpg","credit_id":"59a84534c3a3683c87018d10","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2982132","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tNj7DN2vvZzyA3snhcG05HMi9qD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12425,"name":"racism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-12-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
