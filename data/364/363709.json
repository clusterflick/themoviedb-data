He then rewound the film, repositioned the mattes, and reshot the same camera load. Using only in-camera  editing,  the  light  appears  to  slice  through the film frame in a manner analogous to Matta-Clark’s architectural “cuttings.”","popularity":0.0218,"poster_path":"/bJwrlzifxOsSdHkXxlvMy5CCTDN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"City Slivers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1511415,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gordon Matta-Clark","original_name":"Gordon Matta-Clark","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"561c55fc9251415a64002580","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bJwrlzifxOsSdHkXxlvMy5CCTDN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
