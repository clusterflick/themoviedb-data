Afree-form take on the current trend of cosmetic obsession and the immortal quality of painting, the film searches for \"whats on the inside\". Topical news stories (such as the US military offering free cosmetic surgery) and musical film sequences are created with paint-on-glass animation, found footage and documentary techniques. The music was commissioned for the film. Selected musicians, including New Zealands Hip-Hop artist, \"Coco Solid\" and \"Half Japanese\" founder Jad Fair, wrote and recorded humorously cynical songs about the cosmetic craze. Also included is a rare appearance by the Dutch Ambassador of Cosmetic Surgery, Marijke Helwegen.","popularity":0.0557,"poster_path":"/77PvJjPxtldENNpg0iotPbwH9Eo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cosmetic Emergency","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1152129,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martha Colburn","original_name":"Martha Colburn","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":"/peVvusvDZQy0ICxjlIjegAUFAHz.jpg","credit_id":"56183bb0c3a368245a000635","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/77PvJjPxtldENNpg0iotPbwH9Eo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
