An exclusive interview with Manson Family member Patricia Krenwinkel reveals an unlikely relationship with charismatic Charles Manson that led her to cross every line of moral consciousness, culminating in the brutal murders she committed to win approval of the man she loved. Life After Manson offers a provocative character study that exposes a broken woman struggling with her past, her arduous effort to evaluate the cost of her choices, and the possibility of self-forgiveness. Can society offer her the same, and even identify with a woman who took life only to lose her own in a desperate effort to find love?","popularity":0.0567,"poster_path":"/gvV2S4ppOHV4zOPWF7p8ABx8PK4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Broken Woman.
