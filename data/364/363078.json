Her widowed sister-in-law Suzanne (Anna Prucnal) lives with her, and after awhile it becomes apparent that Catherine loathes her as well. The children in the house are all boys -- Catherine has two sons, twelve and thirteen, and Suzanne also has a twelve-year old. While the relationship between Suzanne and Catherine is coming to a head, Catherine is having an affair with an army officer, and the boys in the family are planning a musical performance for everyone. The crescendo may be barely audible at the beginning, but it builds up to a tragedy at the end.","popularity":0.2581,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":591,"logo_path":"/q5I5RDwMEiqoNmfaJgd2LraEOJY.png","name":"France 3 Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":65074,"logo_path":null,"name":"Agence Française d'Images","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bastien, Bastienne","video":false,"vote_average":5.333,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":18228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juliet Berto","original_name":"Juliet Berto","popularity":0.473,"profile_path":"/8V15SItRZvoTRDdivqAHS8YIrVu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Catherine","credit_id":"56166672c3a3680433002145","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":17575,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Prucnal","original_name":"Anna Prucnal","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":"/29CVCVmgt44QkIAcInbIM4TSks5.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Suzanne","credit_id":"56166699c3a368680e01e834","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":564273,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Orane Demazis","original_name":"Orane Demazis","popularity":0.0993,"profile_path":"/hVL60LFTRIogiLSPuGDN9Zetvae.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Georgette","credit_id":"561666bec3a3680433002159","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1410090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Béatrice Bruno","original_name":"Béatrice Bruno","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/zTSC122I5liDhFx99Lwyzt4AvoG.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Marie","credit_id":"561666de92514129af001bc0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1520255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serge Dambrine","original_name":"Serge Dambrine","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Yves / Bastien","credit_id":"5616670cc3a368680e01e848","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1520256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathieu Lacaille","original_name":"Mathieu Lacaille","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Jean Charles / Colas","credit_id":"5616672c9251412fd500198b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1520257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emmanuel Prat","original_name":"Emmanuel Prat","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Eric / Bastienne","credit_id":"56166754c3a368681701f085","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1179131,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Andrieu","original_name":"Michel Andrieu","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"561665d992514130d200003c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1156927,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Renan Pollès","original_name":"Renan Pollès","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56166612925141031c004539","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1179131,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Andrieu","original_name":"Michel Andrieu","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"561665c9c3a368680b01f2a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35846,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Hilton McConnico","original_name":"Hilton McConnico","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5616664fc3a36818a1007a34","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0078830","wikidata_id":"Q2887703","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
