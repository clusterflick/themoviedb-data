Primo, on the other hand, asked his cop cousin Victor to pretend to be him for he lacks enough confidence to woo his foreign lover. Victor, who is very much focused on doing his job perfectly, thoughtlessly granted his cousin’s request. However, as Victor gets to spend time with Isabel, he finds himself diverting his concerns in finding out if Isabel is the right woman for him. Isabel, on the other hand, couldn’t help but fall in love with Victor too. Primo got jealous with the blooming romance of his cousin and penpal, who is associated to Vernon, a drug lord who is plotting something against Victor.","popularity":0.2707,"poster_path":"/vehdfaodIzVn9GaBqQRIJSjl9n6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4676,"logo_path":"/fu7gOKwS2l2fiFlEQFamITFEWDk.png","name":"Star Cinema – ABS-CBN Film Productions","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"1999-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Type Kita… Walang Kokontra","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cesar Montano","original_name":"Cesar Montano","popularity":0.7439,"profile_path":"/5x08qe2fNtWV61DVPoRutZSgf7c.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Victor Madrid","credit_id":"561b61d29251415a5c00024e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1179652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dayanara Torres","original_name":"Dayanara Torres","popularity":0.2918,"profile_path":"/ohEAE5O4FStORH3X4p3vHSuPdKc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Isabel Torres","credit_id":"561b61dc9251415a5c000250","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bayani Agbayani","original_name":"Bayani Agbayani","popularity":0.1542,"profile_path":"/gkBwG69GP9OlN0btCVtfI21k768.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Primo Barcelona","credit_id":"561b61ea9251415a6e000279","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":934089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Regala","original_name":"John Regala","popularity":0.2107,"profile_path":"/o3uaAXFp94OkBoHYc18UW6qIVdF.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Vernon","credit_id":"561b61fec3a368225e000256","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1365924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriel Romulo","original_name":"Gabriel Romulo","popularity":0.0798,"profile_path":"/4GyyQ8xDEJ1M8ogMci98RVolKgs.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Renato Segovia","credit_id":"561b620dc3a36822580002d2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Alvarez","original_name":"Roy Alvarez","popularity":0.1008,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Alex Portugal","credit_id":"561b621b9251415a7200025a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":939089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jorge Estregan","original_name":"Jorge Estregan","popularity":0.1004,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Tong","credit_id":"561b62289251415a7200025e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":113254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serena Dalrymple","original_name":"Serena Dalrymple","popularity":0.0907,"profile_path":"/5woJe5xyWPT5OfcJZX6bOP3UDo.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Nene","credit_id":"561b6237c3a3682253000256","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1326672,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flora Gasser","original_name":"Flora Gasser","popularity":0.062,"profile_path":"/zq84NONmR2triCqINJTok62pinV.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Lola Becky","credit_id":"561b6242c3a368225600028a","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1500238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tracy Vergel","original_name":"Tracy Vergel","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Aileen","credit_id":"561b6250c3a36822580002da","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1365527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pocholo Montes","original_name":"Pocholo Montes","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/nMp5wbi7i1S7dDuVA9HB46VubBT.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Maj.
