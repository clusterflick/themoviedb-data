A people without a voice (80'), 2. A land in mourning (78'). Part 1: A people without a voice: October 88, the Algerian Republic is faltering, the film goes back to the sources of this tragedy and explains how the face to face between the Islamists and those in power began. The interruption of the legislative elections of December 91, followed shortly after the assassination of President Boudiaf in June 92, plunged Algeria into chaos. Part 2: A land in mourning: the cycle of violence that leads to massacres and the economic and geopolitical underside of the war. More than 100,000 deaths, an incredible degree of barbarity, massacres, apparently incomprehensible... Behind the official window of power and its artificial political scene, hides a shadow power.","popularity":0.3379,"poster_path":"/igtbUTvbHMsrrbMSsW2VLQ8ujMp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":240328,"logo_path":"/26DeBnbP3szJ8whFvF0t458e8Em.png","name":"Article
