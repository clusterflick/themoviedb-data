Television live relay. In one of the Royal Opera’s most celebrated and popular productions, director David McVicar mixes lavish historical costumes and dark stylized settings to highlight the savagery and excitement of Verdi’s tale of misdirected revenge. Paolo Gavanelli is vocally and theatrically electrifying as the hunchback anti-hero, acclaimed soprano Christine Schäfer is his doomed daughter, and superstar tenor Marcelo Alvarez is her fickle lover. With superb playing from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, it adds up to a thrilling Rigoletto for both opera aficionados and newcomers.","popularity":0.2512,"poster_path":"/aZRjYDqmD6TZpcuXNFyuSgvMYBO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4775,"logo_path":"/z1HSU7AQ04jeOICLE1mBzEJxiEJ.png","name":"Opus Arte","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":11514,"logo_path":"/uC4LtXWXfuDleivpGYSOsl8veXN.png","name":"Royal Opera House","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2001-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":169,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rigoletto","video":true,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Rigoletto (2001) Royal Opera","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Ópera Directo: Rigoletto","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Rigoletto.
