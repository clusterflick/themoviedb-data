Even while a shocking mystery surrounds her disappearance, and her disembodied soul begins a grim haunting, the Solis family’s biggest fear has yet to be faced.     When it’s discovered that two little girls, the same age as Mary’s sister, Sophia, went missing on the lake the very night that Mary disappeared, the stakes are raised. Is Mary suffering from a centuries old condition known as Loss of Soul? Or, is it something more nefarious?     After enlisting the help of a Shaman, the Solis family embarks on a journey to the spirit worlds, hunting for a supernatural cure.","popularity":0.9404,"poster_path":"/exGOOYT1zH2HuD9XJIkfcuzgkx6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Part of Mary's soul has been ripped from her body.","title":"Mary Loss of Soul","video":false,"vote_average":3.6,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Zúñiga","original_name":"José Zúñiga","popularity":1.6765,"profile_path":"/r6nFkJkMHP9tFDohwfav9Bf2rCR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Victor Solis","credit_id":"56186d0f9251413752000e66","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1493434,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaylee Kaneshiro","original_name":"Kaylee Kaneshiro","popularity":0.7886,"profile_path":"/bkghJ9iJ3BkPildwPR5sAw8qgeb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mary Solis","credit_id":"56186d299251413760000e4d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":110245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Black","original_name":"Catherine Black","popularity":0.2039,"profile_path":"/2b83HslBqBgVZje3xR30DkIelQN.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Gina Solis","credit_id":"56186d3cc3a368244a000de7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1520804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Bex","original_name":"Anne Bex","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Sophia Solis","credit_id":"56186d52925141375d000dd6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Mancuso","original_name":"Nick Mancuso","popularity":0.4372,"profile_path":"/sGOtCUJed5lyx4eUOFcKbIKVRDI.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Detective Mark O'Hagan","credit_id":"56186d87c3a368245a000f48","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2776602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma MacKenzie","original_name":"Emma MacKenzie","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Trice Hovey","credit_id":"5fe857f89cc67b003f5d06f7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2292584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Myerson","original_name":"Sam Myerson","popularity":0.2765,"profile_path":"/d9zPqu5ditbbYuzznPdjaQNcb1S.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"A.J.
