The artist divided the north façade into nine parts. In the film you hear him ask the builders to postpone the demolition. Hence the word play Bingo/Ninths, which became beagone by ninth. The house was demolished an hour after he had finished. The segments were transported to Art Park, where some of them were dumped to be gradually swept away by the Niagara River.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/7hHIK5uJEV6sEGMk0tIEWfX98V1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"An hour later, the bulldozer arrived.","title":"Bingo/Ninths","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1511415,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gordon Matta-Clark","original_name":"Gordon Matta-Clark","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"561c52ba9251415a7200261c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1511415,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gordon Matta-Clark","original_name":"Gordon Matta-Clark","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c3c5088ac38c7b854e1048","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7hHIK5uJEV6sEGMk0tIEWfX98V1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Super 8 film","release_date":"1974-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
