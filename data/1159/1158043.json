Despite how bleak the pandemic was, it brought them to listen to their bodies, minds and hearts. This documentary is a tapestry of video snapshots from the lives of 10 Filipino theater artists during the height of the pandemic lockdown. The artists tell their stories mostly through video diaries using phone cameras to record their daily lives, their feelings and thoughts, while locked in their homes with no work, no income, and with a sense that their country is going to pieces. Conversations with the filmmaker via Zoom were also recorded. It provides a perspective on how theater artists found ways and means to survive, to take care of their mental health, and even break protocols to persist in their advocacies.","popularity":0.1844,"poster_path":"/r3mxjMoKXiurZG6MqDMkCyFbia8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2023-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lockdown Diaries: Covid-19","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4248370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Barcial","original_name":"Jason Barcial","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64f26d3ddbbb42011b71732f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4248371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jenny Lee Bonto","original_name":"Jenny Lee Bonto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64f26d5d74507d01390edb01","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1490437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lotlot Bustamante","original_name":"Lotlot Bustamante","popularity":0.1374,"profile_path":"/jeLGtFEgAIIomBj3azVMBiGNZXp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64f26d66e0ca7f014f6af950","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4248372,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikki Cimafranca","original_name":"Nikki Cimafranca","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64f26d70e0ca7f014f6af95c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4248373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toni Go-Yadao","original_name":"Toni Go-Yadao","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64f26d7897a4e60138968ffc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4248374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Csai Habla","original_name":"Csai Habla","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"64f26d89e0ca7f00cbe530ae","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4248375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"JV Ibesate","original_name":"JV Ibesate","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"64f26da9caa508014c8c5520","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2915865,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Liza Magtoto","original_name":"Liza Magtoto","popularity":0.0402,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"64f26db0caa50800e9527691","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4248376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louie Pascasio","original_name":"Louie Pascasio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"64f26db6e0ca7f014f6af970","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3830436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hope Tinambacan","original_name":"Hope Tinambacan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"64f26dd2caa508014c8c552a","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3031055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Avic Ilagan","original_name":"Avic Ilagan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f26df0e0ca7f00cbe530c7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3031055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Avic Ilagan","original_name":"Avic Ilagan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c654a363e6fb00fef23517","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28636611","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1752,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r3mxjMoKXiurZG6MqDMkCyFbia8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1168}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tl","note":"Cinemalaya Philippine Independent Film Festival","release_date":"2023-08-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
