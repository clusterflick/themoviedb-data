He was a privileged witness to some little-known dramatic aspects of the Liberation: the rapes and murders committed by GIs on French civilians. He also discovered the racism of American military justice.  This experience haunted the novelist for thirty years. In 1976, he recounted it in a short novel, \"Ok, Joe\", which went unnoticed. This film compares his account with the memories of the last witnesses to these forgotten crimes and their punishments.","popularity":0.4595,"poster_path":"/ezjyfxmQvxMNUW6oH1aP9kB8r8G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129169,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Sillage","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/qpFsGoa96SytbWkhtkkpllu5Cch.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":127436,"logo_path":"/85hn0WZVj2wpm7scTkrQz76lKJ7.png","name":"LCP -
