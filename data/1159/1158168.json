Unlike a real bird though, she cannot fly because she is, after all, still a girl. Hated by her father, she is driven from home and ends up joining the circus as a freak attraction.  Adopted by a friendly, drunken clown she settles into her niche as a circus performer. As time goes by, she longs to be a real woman, a human, but there is no place for such a bird-creature in the world outside the circus. So, she creates her own fantasy world as she dreams about the life of a normal girl, somewhere far away from the circus. In the end, she dreams herself away from it all leaving the audience wondering if the girl was actually there, or if it was something they may have imagined â€“ a girl with wings and a beak.","popularity":0.2717,"poster_path":"/xE17UVeVNoDiO8CL7rKJImiNyCI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18889,"logo_path":"/30mRFDmJAdbOMCFhFGst9izWJhD.png","name":"Il Luster","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2004-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"BEK (Beak) is a tale about a girl who is born with wings instead of arms and a beak where a mouth should be.","title":"Beak","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1265184,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucette Braune","original_name":"Lucette Braune","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c6a4f2eec5b500ff5257f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xE17UVeVNoDiO8CL7rKJImiNyCI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":277462,"name":"bird"},{"id":293194,"name":"youth"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":["Violence"],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2004-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
