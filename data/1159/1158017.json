The film's epicenter is George Jordan, a formerly enslaved man turned soldier whose exemplary courage in battles etches a stark contrast against his forgotten legacy. Juxtaposing the resistance of Apache Chiefs and braves with Jordan's unwavering will to protect his comrades and white settlers, the narrative challenges us to reconcile often overlooked aspects of the formation of the West. With a stark reminder of Jordan’s decline due to his heroic yet under-acknowledged efforts and the refusal of the Army to provide him with care, the film crescendos into a plea for recognition of the Buffalo Soldiers, ultimately asking what we can give to make our country better.","popularity":0.3741,"poster_path":"/jVeHf055nejcHMWkRT0qxtyZG2q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160168,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Dorado Films","origin_country":""},{"id":173486,"logo_path":null,"name":"Veteran Documentary Corps","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A compelling exploration of the overlooked contributions of African American soldiers during America's Westward expansion, centering on the under-recognized efforts of George Jordan, who tenaciously fought against Apache resistances.","title":"Buffalo Soldiers:  George Jordan and the Indian Wars","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2440975,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel L.
