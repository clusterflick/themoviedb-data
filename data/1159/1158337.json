The word Baül is derived from the Sanskrit word \"vatul,\" which means \"mad\" in the sense that it commonly connotes a more or less frenetic behavior in French.  The Baül are peculiar individuals, particularly in their mannerisms, customs, and practices. Although they may belong to either the Hindu or Muslim religion, the Baül refuse to be guided by any social or religious conventions. Freedom of spirit is their only guide. They thus move against the tide of habits, preconceived notions, and general theories.  \"Le chant des fous\" (The Song of the Mad) is a film made by Georges Luneau.","popularity":0.3662,"poster_path":"/6rCbO3xcgMnrjQMZviX00UewT3d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1979-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Bauls of West Bengal are nomad musicians who practice a traditional form of concert challenged by the increasing modernization of India.","title":"Songs of the madmen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le chant des fous","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4189270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gour Khyapa","original_name":"Gour Khyapa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64c72a7f63e6fb011b3af01f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2073249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kartik Das Baul","original_name":"Kartik Das Baul","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/37a6f3uOdSt4j1E75f1wnkkSDDY.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64c73711cadb6b01066ddc66","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2174187,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paban Das Baul","original_name":"Paban Das Baul","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64c7389563e6fb00c409bfe7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4189306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramzan Fakir","original_name":"Ramzan Fakir","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64c738c995ce2400e411d04a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4189262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Luneau","original_name":"Georges Luneau","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c7278930f79c00e4f00113","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4189262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Luneau","original_name":"Georges Luneau","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c7354663aad2020ec425a5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5886056","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":2102,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uYekus6TN336j6o2McOOT6X81Le.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3736}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1942,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6rCbO3xcgMnrjQMZviX00UewT3d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1295}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":170813,"name":"tantra"},{"id":283297,"name":"music"},{"id":305028,"name":"religion and spirituality"},{"id":321240,"name":"baul music"},{"id":321241,"name":"baul"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1979-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"bn","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bengale.
