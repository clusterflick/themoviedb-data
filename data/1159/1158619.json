Mozart's Singspiel seamlessly alternates seriousness and jollity, and combines philosophical ideas with a fairytale world of wondrous animals and magical musical instruments. Emanuel Schikaneder's original production was theatrically inventive, and this new interpretation from director Simon McBurney emulates that in fresh and current terms. Fusing music, technology and stagecraft, this exciting production gives Die Zauberflote a refreshing new treatment that is both thrilling and simple in it's approach. Following an overwhelming success on stage, McBurney's unique production received five-star reviews in the Dutch press: 'a feast for the eyes and the ears' (Het Parool) and 'Delicious!' (Trouw).","popularity":0.3679,"poster_path":"/krdNM3Y4IKsLF39zcD1ReVsLlkk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4775,"logo_path":"/z1HSU7AQ04jeOICLE1mBzEJxiEJ.png","name":"Opus Arte","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2015-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mozart: The Magic Flute","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Magic Flute","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brindley Sherratt","original_name":"Brindley Sherratt","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/tTie8tju3MepAbbiuaEIgpG6Kuu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sarastro, Bass","credit_id":"64c81d8bd6c30000e4498113","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolfgang Ablinger-Sperrhacke","original_name":"Wolfgang Ablinger-Sperrhacke","popularity":0.0542,"profile_path":"/u6vggu2ugLVNOFcMVuKlNr3XH0N.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Monostatos, Tenor","credit_id":"64c81f1ecadb6b01440ed6e3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1960301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iride Martinez","original_name":"Iride Martinez","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Queen of the Night, Soprano","credit_id":"64c81dfacadb6b012570fd5d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2470859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maximilian Schmitt","original_name":"Maximilian Schmitt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Tamino, Tenor","credit_id":"64c81e5063e6fb011b3b7192","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1139466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christina Landshamer","original_name":"Christina Landshamer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Pamina, Soprano","credit_id":"64c81da563e6fb011b3b7164","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1563365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Oliemans","original_name":"Thomas Oliemans","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Papageno, Baritone","credit_id":"64c81ec395ce24011e5a3770","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4190445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Lejderman","original_name":"Nina Lejderman","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Papagena, Soprano","credit_id":"64c825e5d7a70a00c525ee9f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2168682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Maria Labin","original_name":"Ana Maria Labin","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"First Lady, Soprano","credit_id":"64c81d6d097c4900c5df6fa0","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Silvia De La Muela","original_name":"Silvia De La Muela","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Second Lady, Mezzo soprano","credit_id":"64c81e8941aac40fb3e63171","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4190448,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Faylenbogen","original_name":"Julia Faylenbogen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Third Lady, Mezzo soprano","credit_id":"64c8262beec5b558e9e3cee5","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2156260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elmar Gilbertsson","original_name":"Elmar Gilbertsson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"First Armed Man;
