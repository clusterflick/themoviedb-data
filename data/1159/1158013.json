Joanne Conte, the indomitable child of Italian immigrants, weathers the storm of public vilification as her past is unceremoniously plastered across the front pages of Colorado papers and on The Maury Povich Show. Yet, this assault on her character is not enough to halt the unwavering march of her life of service. She breaks barriers as the first transgender person to be elected to a city council in U.S. history, but her identity extends far beyond this groundbreaking accomplishment. As a valiant soldier, an impassioned activist, and a tenacious politician, Conte carves out a formidable legacy. This is an emotionally charged and evocatively detailed portrait of Joanne Conte, a multifaceted individual who lived her life far beyond the simplistic narratives of headlines.","popularity":0.5958,"poster_path":"/pFJV6c1UB3SxqnDTwBXTH4fvt0O.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160168,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Dorado Films","origin_country":""},{"id":173486,"logo_path":null,"name":"Veteran Documentary Corps","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"As a Korean War veteran, activist, investigative journalist, and the first elected transgender city council member in U.S. history, Joanne Conte forges a powerful legacy of resilience and unwavering dedication to public service.","title":"Conte: Transitioning Politics","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4187778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary \tHudgins","original_name":"Mary \tHudgins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Mary \tHudgins","credit_id":"64c6336141aac40fb5484157","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4187779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris \tDaly","original_name":"Chris \tDaly","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Chris \tDaly","credit_id":"64c6336d63e6fb00acdc51e0","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3665259,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Oriana Ledesma","original_name":"Oriana Ledesma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dbc9777719d7010252667f","department":"Production","job":"Consulting Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3463303,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jesse Collier Sutterley","original_name":"Jesse Collier Sutterley","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c633a763e6fb00acdc51fd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3665337,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joshua Cardenas","original_name":"Joshua Cardenas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c633e0cadb6b00c829e51f","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3463303,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jesse Collier Sutterley","original_name":"Jesse Collier Sutterley","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c633b3cadb6b01440ddb6d","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1666002,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dan Olmsted","original_name":"Dan Olmsted","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c633ffeec5b500ff522333","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3665259,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Oriana Ledesma","original_name":"Oriana Ledesma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c63416eec5b500e23c2329","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3463303,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jesse Collier Sutterley","original_name":"Jesse Collier Sutterley","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c6339beec5b50139ffef24","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2440975,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel L.
