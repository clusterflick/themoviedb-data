Texas. A punk rock coming-of-age film about two Latinx best friends trying to play their first show as a band, a quest that is complicated by the fact that one of them is undocumented and the other has crippling stage fright. They have less than 48 hours to create a fan base and figure out what their sound is. In the process, they go about discovering their own culture and metaphorically “killing” their whitewashed brit punk idols.","popularity":0.4235,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":205236,"logo_path":"/yETnxIFACP6UYFgV8BmINw4xbGU.png","name":"Antigravity Academy","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Kill Yr Idols","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":180486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gina Rodriguez","original_name":"Gina Rodriguez","popularity":1.0103,"profile_path":"/5t6YkhPbYgug29TMCmgsgTNs3PJ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"64c8ee38b97442014e8d2224","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1932178,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos López Estrada","original_name":"Carlos López Estrada","popularity":0.1795,"profile_path":"/hmmicxProrj8sXYu5obBu5QNsNR.jpg","credit_id":"64c8ee2f08cf870139ecd673","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernardo Cubria","original_name":"Bernardo Cubria","popularity":0.191,"profile_path":"/lBo6arY6BC3KBbSGuEQ9niwq6qC.jpg","credit_id":"64c8edcad5191f01396f8e33","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285169,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Hibey","original_name":"John Hibey","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c8edd389f74900ae0bf2e7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1932178,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos López Estrada","original_name":"Carlos López Estrada","popularity":0.1795,"profile_path":"/hmmicxProrj8sXYu5obBu5QNsNR.jpg","credit_id":"64c8ed9af794ad00c594d236","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1055232,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Gottwald","original_name":"Michael Gottwald","popularity":0.044,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c8edfbb97442014e8d220c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1372786,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josh Soskin","original_name":"Josh Soskin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c8eddcf794ad013959d988","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1663195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelly Marie Tran","original_name":"Kelly Marie Tran","popularity":0.788,"profile_path":"/wmJTR2vxcCWKNMF7XPdNqhmo2rj.jpg","credit_id":"64c8edec1fa1c800eeae9432","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
