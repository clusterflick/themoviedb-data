As she navigates through the gut-wrenching chronology of his enlistment on the eve of 9/11, his traumatizing experiences in combat, and his futile attempts at readjustment after returning home, the narrative unravels to reveal the silent and insidious toll of war on the mental health of soldiers. Compelled by her son's devastating suicide, Velda transforms her grief into a call for action, articulating her concerns about the military's approach to mental health issues in a letter to the president. This heart-rending short film underscores the often overlooked consequences of war, giving voice to those left in its devastating wake.","popularity":0.2184,"poster_path":"/xiV2Zz1MD9fN83MQPXRdIMw0Iwl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160168,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Dorado Films","origin_country":""},{"id":173486,"logo_path":null,"name":"Veteran Documentary Corps","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A mother confronts the devastating consequences of war on her son's mental health, leading her from personal tragedy to impassioned activism as she challenges the government's handling of veterans' mental health issues.","title":"Velda: A Mom's Story of Suicide","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4187807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Velda Dobson Davis","original_name":"Velda Dobson Davis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Velda Dobson Davis","credit_id":"64c638a6eec5b500ad026cae","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2572000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diana Sánchez Maciel","original_name":"Diana Sánchez Maciel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c6394863e6fb00c4095019","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2105884,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrés Gallegos","original_name":"Andrés Gallegos","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c638ed63aad2020c3b3780","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3463303,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jesse Collier Sutterley","original_name":"Jesse Collier Sutterley","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c638b9cadb6b00ac660528","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3338300,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert Barbarino","original_name":"Robert Barbarino","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c638fc63e6fb00fef226df","department":"Camera","job":"Second Assistant \"A\" Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3463303,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jesse Collier Sutterley","original_name":"Jesse Collier Sutterley","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c638cbeec5b500ff522558","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3665337,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joshua Cardenas","original_name":"Joshua Cardenas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c6390863aad20209a54a97","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2440975,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel L.
