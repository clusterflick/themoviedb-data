In the film, we witness Mr. Pletnev's journey, starting from him on his way to studio, through his performance of Chopin's Etude Op. 25 No. 7 in C sharp minor \"The Cello\" and the process afterwards. One is struck repeatedly by Pletnev's crystalline arpeggiations, the velocity of his passage work, his singing tone, his rhythmic suppleness, and, above all, the grandeur of his sound.","popularity":0.5101,"poster_path":"/pfgVaSjYgYKal8fLascnzqJfGPf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":200,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"CHOPIN: 12 Études Op. 25 No. 7 in C sharp minor, The Cello","title":"Chopin-Pletnev: Cello","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Mikhail Pletnev - Chopin 12 Études op. 25 no. 7 in C sharp minor \"The Cello\"","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2261744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikhail Pletnev","original_name":"Mikhail Pletnev","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/lOdX948dF2mWuxQHWqnJhaRvTK3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself - Pianist","credit_id":"64c8f4f2b97442010c1db22d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4191404,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emile Berliner","original_name":"Emile Berliner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c8f58b1fa1c800eeae9755","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73598,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Frédéric Chopin","original_name":"Fryderyk Chopin","popularity":0.0867,"profile_path":"/bpknVuZcUXcqAEUECWteAXWYjUN.jpg","credit_id":"64c8f642b9744200eb520326","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2261744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikhail Pletnev","original_name":"Mikhail Pletnev","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/lOdX948dF2mWuxQHWqnJhaRvTK3.jpg","credit_id":"64c8f665d5191f00acd58f04","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0365826","wikidata_id":"Q512015","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.776,"height":1126,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ejb7ZlMTgF542Xpw5QsP9rhaDle.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pfgVaSjYgYKal8fLascnzqJfGPf.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5783,"name":"classical music"},{"id":159944,"name":"recording"},{"id":207592,"name":"piano"},{"id":210201,"name":"virtuoso"},{"id":283297,"name":"music"},{"id":298785,"name":"chopin"},{"id":321291,"name":"mikhail pletnev"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Mikhail Pletnev – Chopin: 12 Études Op. 25 No. 7 In C Sharp Minor Cello","key":"te6-YxGmItM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-10-11T16:01:15.000Z","id":"64c8f80d1fa1c800b0c19cc8"}]}}}
