The built-in poetics of Detroit’s Central Train Station are explored. Henry Ford's influence in the city lead to divestment in trains and the station closed in 1988. In 2018 The Ford Motor Company bought the abandoned station and announced plans to transform it into the companies' self-driving car headquarters. The film tries to undo the mythology around Ford, both old and new, as an anchor for the city. The poetics find limitations in Detroit’s ongoing desire for innovation and growth - often at the expense of truth.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We May Go In a Different Direction","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3444855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sally Lawton","original_name":"Sally Lawton","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/uXo5U1tpUnpboDE8i8L3aLrOU2Z.jpg","credit_id":"64c7fb07d6c300011ee1d7a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"​Big Muddy Film Festival, Carbondale IL, 2022 ​","release_date":"2022-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
