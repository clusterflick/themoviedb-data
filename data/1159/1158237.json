The fact that the two occupy two adjoining rooms in the only hotel in town is less so, because they are anything but friends.

nature.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/xEoeLllYUTWI1ZUrc83bJNp0Yhm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6046,"logo_path":"/3ti5RVxeaTtliD2QdNtHn31J8Yj.png","name":"Video Teresa
