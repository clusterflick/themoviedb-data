All the tension that shaped the Israeli identity: periphery-center, Ashkenazi and Mizrachi jews, the \"first\" Israel and the \"second\" Israel are all present in the life story of the man who was the king of Israel but did not succeed to become Prime Minister. After 15 years of almost complete media silence, David Levy conducts in front of the camera a self-examination of his life. A self-examination of a politician and statesman, whose life story is very much the significant and central story of the state of Israel in the last decades.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"King David","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1567159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robby Elmaliah","original_name":"Robby Elmaliah","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c7e51bcadb6b012570e9ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1164961,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Amir Ben-David","original_name":"Amir Ben-David","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c7e506eec5b558ea8b844e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
