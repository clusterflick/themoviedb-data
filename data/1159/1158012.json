Then, on New Year's Eve 2006, farmer Brouwer decides he has had it with his fatherland's control freakery. 'One half of Holland controls the other half. I'm completely fed up.' Brouwer wants to emigrate to France, taking along his livestock (which fits in two huge trucks), Hendrik and his girlfriend.","popularity":0.122,"poster_path":"/zrLNUGMCBehxiMxf0mzQKK2m2J7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2008-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"De boer die zou gaan emigreren","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1203982,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Geertjan Lassche","original_name":"Geertjan Lassche","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/pFNOf88Tj2ECDL9GEzOLVpVYTeo.jpg","credit_id":"64c6540d63e6fb00c4095da8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4187981,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Menno Mennes","original_name":"Menno Mennes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c655d341aac40fb5485148","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1203982,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Geertjan Lassche","original_name":"Geertjan Lassche","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/pFNOf88Tj2ECDL9GEzOLVpVYTeo.jpg","credit_id":"64c655e1eec5b500ff5234d5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3425734,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jan Smelik","original_name":"Jan Smelik","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c655ebeec5b501390001c6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1503106","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zrLNUGMCBehxiMxf0mzQKK2m2J7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2008-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
