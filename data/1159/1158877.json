The simplest solution of the situation is to marry her, and upon being reminded of it, the hero lays plans for a hurried ceremony in the goldfish store where he works. But as it is a case of true love, things don't move smoothly. Customers interrupt and so forth, as the justice of the peace tries to spiel off the fateful words. The culminating disaster is when firemen smash in the door, but a simple solution presents itself and the lovers, justice of the peace and witnesses make off with the hook and ladder wagon and the knot is tied before they are caught.","popularity":0.3395,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":2159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hal Roach Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1924-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Goofy Age","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glenn Tryon","original_name":"Glenn Tryon","popularity":0.1556,"profile_path":"/hW151n1jq7F99WpAD25ido1fdVw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Husband","credit_id":"64c8d3b208cf8700ac9cea79","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1055263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blanche Mehaffey","original_name":"Blanche Mehaffey","popularity":0.1224,"profile_path":"/wo9rNAnMpJkg3MtsXaAN6qHlcJU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Wife","credit_id":"64c8d3c8d5191f00c52a1d88","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Gillespie","original_name":"William Gillespie","popularity":0.0797,"profile_path":"/pzl1sf0FRwey3Xpj1bWKxrbrdOq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64c8d3d8d5191f00c52a1d97","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":150190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura La Varnie","original_name":"Laura La Varnie","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/edLXDzUMNasuUXqQWDfM8A7sWCt.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64c8d404f794ad00e26c95d1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noah Young","original_name":"Noah Young","popularity":0.1069,"profile_path":"/g6JErSrooY8JZgUkADkFiBNGXiP.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"64c8d41c1fa1c800b0c18dc7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1269186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al Hallett","original_name":"Al Hallett","popularity":0.08,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64c8d3efd5191f00e22cf487","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1095971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patsy O'Byrne","original_name":"Patsy O'Byrne","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/uub2JzvyFh3LsY8BbiCpioaWkDj.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64c8d411f794ad00c594c73b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4191285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Marion","original_name":"George Marion","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"64c8d43a1fa1c80130dcb77e","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33223,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hal Roach","original_name":"Hal Roach","popularity":0.2083,"profile_path":"/cV3xbMdZEQdNhHKdI9T6BL2PBSy.jpg","credit_id":"64c8d48c08cf8700ff55cf56","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18740,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred Guiol","original_name":"Fred Guiol","popularity":0.278,"profile_path":"/qfvRYsGgeAIMT7SdHIzIg8MsN5M.jpg","credit_id":"64c8d467d5191f00e22cf4b4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143558,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ted Wilde","original_name":"Ted Wilde","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/xQdOal0IvpIlOnQirA8yRMVAzXy.jpg","credit_id":"64c8d47789f74900ae0be7a0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0159463","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1924-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
