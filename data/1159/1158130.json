The character of Senior, played by Joris Smit, was inspired by the filmmakerâ€™s grandfather who was a POW in one of the Japanese internment camps during WWII, where he was forced to work on the Thai-Burma Railway. He died from the effects a few years later.  In this personal film, young veteran Senior lives on in a surreal monitoring space. On his monitors, he observes his now elderly Indonesian son Junior, and looks back in in time. When images from the war involuntarily return to him, Senior finds himself in contemporary Thailand while he re-experiences the war. Strong, contradictory emotions arise in him in relation to his son. Gradually, a hidden history is revealed.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":"/nQtNEuJlu8OC6rSE6PWpaokMSK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flat Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1040926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joris Smit","original_name":"Joris Smit","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/mBukRnFRjMOCN91fSmH1oHzJzOl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64c6878ccadb6b01440e06b7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4188270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Piet Verhoeckx","original_name":"Piet Verhoeckx","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64c6879595ce2400af1bca17","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4188269,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Monique Verhoeckx","original_name":"Monique Verhoeckx","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c6877ccadb6b00ac662c21","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1674,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nQtNEuJlu8OC6rSE6PWpaokMSK.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1116},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1674,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7VgipagpxFrAHG8cHA9SWJT8YUE.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1184}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
