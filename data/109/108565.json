French doctor Henrik takes her to his clinic, for rehabilitation purposes, and falls in love with her as does his friend, Si Lahssen, the reigning prince of this small Moroccan state. When a plague falls on the town, Saadia is convinced she is responsible, and rides alone into the mountain country to retrieve the plague serum being held for ransom by bandits. The love triangle dominates most of the rest of the film.","popularity":0.8471,"poster_path":"/wuhvJ0xMaT8e0BvjviBENaNR3J.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1953-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Saadia","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cornel Wilde","original_name":"Cornel Wilde","popularity":0.3235,"profile_path":"/1IJ9DLHUCgAWuYgj2zJMC5Mca8S.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Si Lahssen","credit_id":"52fe4a9fc3a36847f81d8ce3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Ferrer","original_name":"Mel Ferrer","popularity":0.8077,"profile_path":"/hWYjmKZ5uk1PLxfgedTNnTa6tP9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Henrik","credit_id":"52fe4a9fc3a36847f81d8ce7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":120391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rita Gam","original_name":"Rita Gam","popularity":0.2758,"profile_path":"/3rOxOMjgHZBLyoiKgMtXFT8bSfu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Saadia","credit_id":"52fe4a9fc3a36847f81d8ceb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12748,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Simon","original_name":"Michel Simon","popularity":0.2022,"profile_path":"/vFERO7RMA4B457nqu9hcybSXdGn.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bou Rezza","credit_id":"52fe4a9fc3a36847f81d8cef","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cyril Cusack","original_name":"Cyril Cusack","popularity":0.732,"profile_path":"/hy340n3PsijAftH2LGg98aYGTZl.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Khadir","credit_id":"5772a5e29251415cb60002bd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":48201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wanda Rotha","original_name":"Wanda Rotha","popularity":0.1609,"profile_path":"/5VklVXBpQeleL0VhnVEpBh4C3Ng.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Fatima","credit_id":"5772a5ed9251415cbc0002a8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":587106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcel Poncin","original_name":"Marcel Poncin","popularity":0.0807,"profile_path":"/10jmTWmzGFhD1zpp3jR4KtHiF5L.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Moha","credit_id":"5772a5fac3a36846ac0002d4","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1178197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Marlowe","original_name":"Anthony Marlowe","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Captain Sabert","credit_id":"5772a6129251415cae0002ca","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":583903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hélène Vallier","original_name":"Hélène Vallier","popularity":0.1735,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Zoubida","credit_id":"5772a6209251415cb90002c6","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1642647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mahjoub Ben Brahim","original_name":"Mahjoub Ben Brahim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Ahmed","credit_id":"5772a62d9251415cb30002eb","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":538228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Dufilho","original_name":"Jacques Dufilho","popularity":0.1652,"profile_path":"/7CK8OE5ww4AOdH61M1jVMZeimjE.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Bandit leader","credit_id":"5772a6479251415cb60002ef","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1473193,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernard Farrel","original_name":"Bernard Farrel","popularity":0.0731,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Lt.
