His adoption at the age of 3 has erased all memory of his Native culture. When he receives his first-ever contact with his biological mother through a photo in the mail, Dave leaves for Kinogamish, the reserve where he was born. The reunion does not unfold as expected and Dave becomes disoriented, confronted with a world that seems hostile and foreign. His unplanned return to this desolate community causes upheavals and chain reactions, while dredging up a painful past scarred by secrets and lies.","popularity":0.3373,"poster_path":"/gFoldiysrxXXPHfQwTMVjo70to7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20254,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kunakan Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":20255,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films de l'Isle","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2011-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mesnak","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1123270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Andres Trelles Turgeon","original_name":"Victor Andres Trelles Turgeon","popularity":0.1836,"profile_path":"/da54ECcQiSVdsViJVxJ7Uk3NLE4.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dave","credit_id":"52fe4aa2c3a36847f81d95f3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1294991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eve Ringuette","original_name":"Eve Ringuette","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/9pnLWL4ZAeIks2mSPdBif0tNCRb.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Osalic","credit_id":"530632d1c3a36816bc274f49","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1294992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Collin","original_name":"Marco Collin","popularity":0.0684,"profile_path":"/xKMqjpebT40PN610JAtMN9sPqUG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Claude St-Onge","credit_id":"530632d7c3a3685aa82b51af","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1294994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathia Rock","original_name":"Kathia Rock","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/6pLlkMfbXGWNok15cykoUDQ9cyW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Gertrude McKenzie","credit_id":"530632ddc3a3685aa82b5206","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":946666,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Poulin","original_name":"Marco Poulin","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Sapatesh","credit_id":"530632e4c3a3685a6a2a686c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1294995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Buckell","original_name":"Charles Buckell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Léonard","credit_id":"530632ebc3a3685a782b113f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1056479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luc Morissette","original_name":"Luc Morissette","popularity":0.0996,"profile_path":"/hZvd6t0NLyBDxFiNNvxXnV1dO4C.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Jean-Marie Fontaine","credit_id":"530632f2c3a3685a8f281077","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1294996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florent Vollant","original_name":"Florent Vollant","popularity":0.1083,"profile_path":"/4CxdkPjopLwSwUzRvsy2OidLrwk.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Sans-Abris","credit_id":"530632f9c3a3685a9e28db04","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1294997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manon Nolin","original_name":"Manon Nolin","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Fille de Sapatesh","credit_id":"53063300c3a3685a9e28dc1f","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Morin","original_name":"Robert Morin","popularity":0.0512,"profile_path":"/xgRXdfAswhAmdd8fA8hC1pG1Pbt.jpg","credit_id":"53063384c3a36816bc2763a1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1294998,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yves Sioui Durand","original_name":"Yves Sioui Durand","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5306330bc3a3685aa82b54d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1294998,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yves Sioui Durand","original_name":"Yves Sioui Durand","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53063372c3a3685a8f281d3a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1294999,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Louis Hamelin","original_name":"Louis Hamelin","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5306337cc3a3685a872d1b2d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1906425","wikidata_id":"Q16664150","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1429,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gFoldiysrxXXPHfQwTMVjo70to7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":953}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":47972,"name":"native peoples"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
