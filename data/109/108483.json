What is the connection between him and the attempts being made to kill Jane Kerrell, a young girl in her early twenties? As she speeds through the French countryside to the South of France, several attempts are made on her life as she is deliberately forced off the road by another car. But when she reports these attempts, the local Cap Ferrat Police Inspector and the sinister psychiatrist, Dr. Forla believe these attempts are in her imagination and Dr Forla, concludes that Jane is mentally disturbed. At her wits end Jane finds an ally in the young English painter, Paul Hedley who finally believes her life is in danger following an attempt to murder him. When Inspector Malling of Scotland Yard and Mr. Breese arrive in Cap Ferrat trying to uncover the connection between Jane and the murdered man on the ferry, this thrilling puzzle of international intrigue begins to unravel against the backdrop of the French Riviera.","popularity":0.9872,"poster_path":"/ztvnHzUsYm5SZcVCLY6JJ1NMyIs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":49118,"logo_path":null,"name":"London Screen Distributors","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1969-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Someone... was playing a murderous game with her sanity... and her life","title":"Taste of Excitement","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Why Would Anyone Want to Kill a Nice Girl Like You?","type":"TV Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":129431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Renzi","original_name":"Eva Renzi","popularity":0.2304,"profile_path":"/nxlKaNIGjLDX59iY3khKOgVgfHG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jane Kerrell","credit_id":"550d94f9c3a368487d0060fb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15202,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Bowles","original_name":"Peter Bowles","popularity":0.4328,"profile_path":"/j15QR9zAwMDFuqTFLL03zxUrM4g.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Guardi","credit_id":"550d95ccc3a368487d006116","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Buck","original_name":"David Buck","popularity":0.3849,"profile_path":"/ruU1fqPWT4lvaBTyrUlne1H2Dkz.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Paul Hedley","credit_id":"550d950ec3a3681db20053ca","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Vaughan","original_name":"Peter Vaughan","popularity":0.5955,"profile_path":"/pqblKGyukQmyTbMTAhFG1B2mgFq.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Inspector Malling","credit_id":"550d9528c3a368487d006100","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Hubschmid","original_name":"Paul Hubschmid","popularity":0.5357,"profile_path":"/reCRxjSu42RhyBEdrphLsZtXt8s.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Herr Beiber","credit_id":"550d9542c3a3684883005edf","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":25341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Hardy","original_name":"Sophie Hardy","popularity":0.4316,"profile_path":"/5HnvHbEWLKpHHfpb6nQCeJ7lWvC.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Michela","credit_id":"550d955892514146a0005b08","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":67615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kay Walsh","original_name":"Kay Walsh","popularity":0.2609,"profile_path":"/23pK7H4sxPATJ34g8N1yC2RFBTd.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Miss Barrow","credit_id":"550d9576c3a3685be5001abc","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Matthews","original_name":"Francis Matthews","popularity":0.287,"profile_path":"/7Zuiry4LXzPeKDCLTQs029LpnvX.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mr. Breese","credit_id":"550d959692514133c3003bff","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Pravda","original_name":"George Pravda","popularity":0.2309,"profile_path":"/eq5CDpKlFjTCrt4mZ9GG91z8Byl.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Dr. Forla","credit_id":"550d95b6c3a3685be5001ac6","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101528,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Don Sharp","original_name":"Don Sharp","popularity":0.2038,"profile_path":"/dNLiJpyiQgC5ud95D7FvRSfs5TP.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4a9dc3a36847f81d8683","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2182247,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ben Healey","original_name":"Ben Healey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf940b50e0a263ab30117bf","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101528,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Don Sharp","original_name":"Don Sharp","popularity":0.2038,"profile_path":"/dNLiJpyiQgC5ud95D7FvRSfs5TP.jpg","credit_id":"5bf940c00e0a263ab1011570","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2182248,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brian Carton","original_name":"Brian Carton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf940d792514104da00fcf3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":131505,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"George Willoughby","original_name":"George Willoughby","popularity":0.0971,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf940e692514104c100f929","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1312910,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"William J.
