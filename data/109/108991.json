Raghunath subsequently hires Amar to train Shalini to be a good businesswoman, and expects both to marry soon. Then Shalini finds out that there she has a twin named Ratnabai, who is the daughter of a Courtesan who had been intimate with Raghunath, and was responsible for the attempt on Raghunath's life.
