Recorded and filmed on location, it resurrects ancient and forgotten folk music from Sri Lanka, Thailand, Indonesia, Maldives, India and Myanmar. The experience is brought to life for a contemporary audience through a minimalist orchestration of modern electronic waves and flows, thereby preserving the integrity of the music. The musicians come primarily from the coastal communities, towns and villages practically wiped of the world map by the Tsunami of December 26, 2004. It's beauty lies in it's purity and simplicity, a non-judgmental point of view. For the international team who came together, Laya Project is a personal and collective tribute to the resilience of the human spirit.","popularity":0.5116,"poster_path":"/hxvijgQbvS11HcRlPi2bDWwzzRg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2007-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Laya Project","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1880070,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Harold Monfils","original_name":"Harold Monfils","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6a530ac4ad590036fe5508","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2788313,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Patrick Sebag","original_name":"Patrick Sebag","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6a5319e627190037ff2638","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2788314,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sastry Karra","original_name":"Sastry Karra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6a532aa6e2d2003b5e2b8e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2788315,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sonya Mazumdar","original_name":"Sonya Mazumdar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6a5339663b87003a3235f9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2788316,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joanne de Rozario","original_name":"Joanne de Rozario","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6a5342fbe36f00374cfa2e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2788317,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yotam Agam","original_name":"Yotam Agam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6a5356fbe36f0039445472","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2788317,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yotam Agam","original_name":"Yotam Agam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6a535dd55e4d003769a399","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1113519,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ernest Hariyanto","original_name":"Ernest Hariyanto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6a5375cee2f6003635db0f","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1113519,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ernest Hariyanto","original_name":"Ernest Hariyanto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6a537be627190038ff5968","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2788318,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Timur Angin","original_name":"Timur Angin","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6a538ac4ad590038fcf491","department":"Camera","job":"Still Photographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2022626,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Yuk Hoy Cheong","original_name":"Yuk Hoy Cheong","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6a5399cee2f600353339a0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1766175,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Agung Dewantoro","original_name":"Agung Dewantoro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6a53a1a6e2d2003b5e2dbc","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1558973","wikidata_id":"Q6505446","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.742,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hxvijgQbvS11HcRlPi2bDWwzzRg.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":742},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1220,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/39O9gbCZw28SgYWtzXz4pIO3c8x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":863}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":167475,"name":"southeast asia"},{"id":192494,"name":"south asian"},{"id":211390,"name":"world music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New York International Independent Film and Video Festival","release_date":"2007-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Laya Project (Trailer)","key":"400311346","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-03-26T08:45:28.000Z","id":"5f6a528cdbcade0037275ff1"}]}}}
