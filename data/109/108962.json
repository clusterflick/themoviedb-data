One of them, as he is dying, asks Jiang to take his personal effects to his sister.  This being a Wuxia film, our hero is bound by a strict code of honour, and he agrees.  The bandit’s sister, Xiu Xiu (Shu Pei-Pei), is surprisingly forgiving and tells him that he got mixed up in a bad crowd of robbers before he died.  As it happens, these self-same bandits are threatening to tear up the village at any moment, and Jiang prepares to defend it despite being despised by the town folk for killing Xiu Xiu’s brother.","popularity":0.4625,"poster_path":"/gHeSH80JNr7KdDpad43gip5K7G9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5798,"logo_path":"/tmuI9BGXgpWLmokhlxpnG3IGNQB.png","name":"Shaw
