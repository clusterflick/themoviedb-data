A juggler takes in succession about a dozen eggs out of his servant's mouth. He breaks all the eggs into a hat, and after having beaten them up after the manner of a cook, he extracts an egg as large as the hat itself. As soon as he sets this egg on the table there appears a tiny dancing girl, full of life, as big as a baby's doll, and who performs on the table some beautiful stage dances. All of a sudden she increases to the size of a ordinary woman, and jumping on the floor she delights the audience with her turns. The juggler and the dancing girl disappear in the most extraordinary way.” (Méliès Catalog)","popularity":0.2758,"poster_path":"/lC4Tib7qKpDnMmF35kEfLpgJ1X2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Star Film","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":37046,"logo_path":null,"name":"Georges Méliès","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1902-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Microscopic Dancer","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":17,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Dancing Midget","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Méliès","original_name":"Georges Méliès","popularity":0.1982,"profile_path":"/acx5saf22Qj6FV5WAsacRHlZAMn.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4a94c3a36847f81d63d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0225469","wikidata_id":"Q3208154","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lC4Tib7qKpDnMmF35kEfLpgJ1X2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2343,"name":"magic"},{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"},{"id":187256,"name":"ballerina"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1902-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
