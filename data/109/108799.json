These nurses are obvious lesbians. Victor lives with Eliza and her son. He imagines another woman when he is roaming at a coast. He pretends committing a suicide but Eliza does not react to it. Every moment, he stays in front of a blank canvas and thinks. Meanwhile he dresses into Nazi clothes or into women dresses, then he leaves to go to the cinema, and abuses and probably kills a small girl. His masochistic affair with Eliza lasts; he is close to shooting her with a gun but instead she takes out a whip. Victor goes along the streets then he lies naked in front of the canvas on which he has left his bloody fingerprints. After this he drives a funeral car to his work - he is employed in a garden where orchids are grown. Eliza is now the past and in the end, Victor might be dead as someone drives a cross into the ground.","popularity":0.1832,"poster_path":"/89XGw3B037hgHBovQxTNqP8tHX8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1977-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Orchid Gardener","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lars von Trier","original_name":"Lars von Trier","popularity":1.1431,"profile_path":"/a1zVySI0Yqqf3ORegQ1icMfvhAa.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Victor Morse","credit_id":"5a2d3317c3a3680b9d13cf79","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1471668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inger Hvidtfeldt","original_name":"Inger Hvidtfeldt","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Eliza","credit_id":"5d5fbb74ea37e0001275ab13","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2393742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Oksbjerg","original_name":"Karen Oksbjerg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Eliza's girlfriend","credit_id":"5d5fbba1ea37e0001575abbc","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lars von Trier","original_name":"Lars von Trier","popularity":1.1431,"profile_path":"/a1zVySI0Yqqf3ORegQ1icMfvhAa.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4aa3c3a36847f81d9c13","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lars von Trier","original_name":"Lars von Trier","popularity":1.1431,"profile_path":"/a1zVySI0Yqqf3ORegQ1icMfvhAa.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4aa3c3a36847f81d9c19","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2393743,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Hartvig Jensen","original_name":"Hartvig Jensen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d5fbbcba894d63bd19aacaa","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2189417,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Peter K.
