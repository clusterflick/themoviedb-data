He gives his family the slip and moves in with a young couple he meets by chance, doing the cooking, reading, drinking, and engaging in philosophical discussions with them. The young couple comes to love Charles. In secret, he stays in touch with a daughter, and the rest of the family hires a private investigator to find him, setting in motion a business take-over that threatens his Bohemian happiness.","popularity":0.6974,"poster_path":"/j72ljYYQtlnJMd407MNL03StZCC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53721,"logo_path":null,"name":"Groupe
