CIA Agent Bob Taylor (Charles Napier) arrives in Moscow with his new wife Susan (Kimberley Kates) with a highly secret video tape of Russian missiles leaving an unknown base near Moscow under the cover of darkness.  Are these missiles destined to be aimed at the US or are they being smuggled to a terrorist organisation. The Americans need to know where these missiles are going, the only person who can help them discover their destination is Armstrong (Frank Zagarino) an ex buddy of Bob who now trains an elite Russian anti-terrorist squad under the command of Colonel Zukov (Richard Lynch). Zukov is from the old guard, corrupt, ruthless, and will stop at nothing to gain control.","popularity":0.4755,"poster_path":"/klENV7aVrKXv3mdtYGklfXt13li.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92752,"logo_path":null,"name":"Golan / Dadon Impact Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":9077,"logo_path":null,"name":"Martien Holdings A.V.V.","origin_country":""},{"id":925,"logo_path":"/dIb9hjXNOkgxu4kBWdIdK8nM4w.png","name":"Nu Image","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Two people with nothing in common except blood.","title":"Armstrong","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","title":"Sin defensa","type":"video title"},{"iso_3166_1":"BG","title":"Армстронг","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Amenaza nuclear","type":"video title"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Péril atomique","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"O anatropeas","type":"video title"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Armstrong -
