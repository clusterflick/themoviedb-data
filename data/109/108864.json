In \"Demonic Tunes,\" a dynamic hip-hop group called Urban Protectors is \"discovered\" by the notorious record producer Dr. Bones, who plans to turn them into part of his zombie army and dominate the world. In \"The Killing Kind,\" 17 year-old Kwame invokes his grandmother's magic of the \"killing kind\" and puts it into her old rag doll after a group of local thugs put her in the hospital. And finally \"Hidden Evil\" explores a mysterious vault in the basement of an old abandoned high school, where there lurks an evil that has been locked away for 100 years. When they mistakenly free a horrific spirit, the school becomes a deadly prison and there is no way to escape.","popularity":0.9515,"poster_path":"/kNzE4rGv8eYuOMyMxMvZUxr5Cnf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15352,"logo_path":"/sk4KMGNHLCPe03XiQaDmBPnczjy.png","name":"Full Moon Features","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Urban Evil: Trilogy of Fear","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darrow Igus","original_name":"Darrow Igus","popularity":0.3114,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Docteur Bones","credit_id":"5752b504c3a36852100028bd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":177162,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Bates","original_name":"Larry Bates","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":"/u9YHQrgbNGYusFDRaJOjAAJBkw3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jamal","credit_id":"5752b51192514123f0001519","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":79586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Scott Davis","original_name":"Sarah Scott Davis","popularity":0.2319,"profile_path":"/jbGKqzAzgAhoXZfbhptt9bMrvDZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lisa","credit_id":"5752b520c3a368521b002660","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rhonda Claerbaut","original_name":"Rhonda Claerbaut","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Theodora","credit_id":"5752b53cc3a36852100028c9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":155361,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danny Wooten","original_name":"Danny Wooten","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Phil","credit_id":"5752b551c3a36817de001ca0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1489190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tangelia Rouse","original_name":"Tangelia Rouse","popularity":0.2347,"profile_path":"/2OqxEEARFp2dSO7N34wHEUykiYG.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Wanda","credit_id":"5752b55e9251414c4a00243d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1630560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathaniel Lamar","original_name":"Nathaniel Lamar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Maxie","credit_id":"5752b56c9251414c5d002564","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Pulliam","original_name":"Nicole Pulliam","popularity":0.2452,"profile_path":"/XcJAw0P7bPE9ET52P4fZ2hdokk.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Rasha","credit_id":"5752b579925141187e001771","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63198,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Danny Draven","original_name":"Danny Draven","popularity":0.1226,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650efe1ca9117f00e191b495","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19707,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charles Band","original_name":"Charles Band","popularity":0.6669,"profile_path":"/mfTZ5yBOLqxdJ4YG0kHaA5rY0G4.jpg","credit_id":"650efe156f53e10aa7ae798a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45989,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ted Nicolaou","original_name":"Ted Nicolaou","popularity":0.2381,"profile_path":"/bIgHoWJVh4d2hnThSV2yTgyrLPo.jpg","credit_id":"57580dc3c3a368159400044d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Black","original_name":"James Black","popularity":0.252,"profile_path":"/nC3jHGBYxQTFKZ9tEct7alNeqOz.jpg","credit_id":"57580dd5c3a3687d60001497","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7631344","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kNzE4rGv8eYuOMyMxMvZUxr5Cnf.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/r7F88in5rtKbADJ7UyYAr5mKiie.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Urban Evil - Trailer","key":"lqqQcIbJyLg","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2011-10-05T23:44:49.000Z","id":"5f08a9c91f98d100371c1643"}]}}}
