Happens to meet a doctor, whose Pops is also suffering from a curse. Low and behold, the curse that strickens both dudes was laid down on them by the same dark master of the arts. And this dark lord of the magic realm has serious problems letting things slide. All in all, the guy is just a pretty big douche. Even when his pleading, bleeding, crying daughter wishes him to stop he still stays head-strong about his vengeful ways. So, the story follows the formula of watching the victims struggle with being cursed, and watching the victims devise a plan to see if they can save their scaredy cat butts.","popularity":0.2627,"poster_path":"/i2aTnY6bMwvRg47ZV2YHlYcErKE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91246,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hop Chung Film (H.K.)
