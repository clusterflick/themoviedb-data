This is the story of young Adrian, pianist and composer, in love with his sister and having a romantic relationship with her until she thinks it's time to stop. Adrian becomes overwhelmed by the memories of his grandfather and mentor now dead. Then he falls in love with a young neighbour but she is more real in her imagination than in ordinary daily life. Adrian discovers that is just having fantasies and wants to put an end to his life. But his talent comes in the figure on an ancestor to help him and move on to a meaningful life.","popularity":0.1193,"poster_path":"/4gYwRzHEyiQLgJtBAZYqK65CHlB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2004-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Absent Season","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1044118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maximiliano Meneses","original_name":"Maximiliano Meneses","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1002,"character":"Adrian","credit_id":"52fe4a9bc3a36847f81d7f8b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1044119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carolina Silva","original_name":"Carolina Silva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"Lucia","credit_id":"52fe4a9bc3a36847f81d7f8f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1044120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana-Luisa Gálvez","original_name":"Ana-Luisa Gálvez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1004,"character":"Elisa","credit_id":"52fe4a9bc3a36847f81d7f93","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1044121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jorge Naranjo","original_name":"Jorge Naranjo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1005,"character":"The Grandfather","credit_id":"52fe4a9bc3a36847f81d7f97","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1044122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mabel Guzmán","original_name":"Mabel Guzmán","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1006,"character":"The Mother","credit_id":"52fe4a9bc3a36847f81d7f9b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1041201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eduardo Burlé","original_name":"Eduardo Burlé","popularity":0.094,"profile_path":"/tDJUTLspuhGfoKIt5HwerhF4cjx.jpg","cast_id":1007,"character":"The Stranger","credit_id":"52fe4a9bc3a36847f81d7f9f","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1044116,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gustavo Letelier","original_name":"Gustavo Letelier","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a9bc3a36847f81d7f81","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1044117,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maximiliano Meneses","original_name":"Maximiliano Meneses","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a9bc3a36847f81d7f87","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1044116,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gustavo Letelier","original_name":"Gustavo Letelier","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c3ccc4d0e0a2654c18da1d1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2064211,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Raúl Heuty","original_name":"Raúl Heuty","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c3ccc5bc3a36811b43cc3e1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0412692","wikidata_id":"Q5815438","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/4gYwRzHEyiQLgJtBAZYqK65CHlB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
