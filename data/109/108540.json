Wilson is co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, a man included in TIME Magazine's \"100 Persons of the 20th Century.\" Interviews, recreations, and rare archival material reveal how Bill Wilson, a hopeless drunk near death from his alcoholism, found a way out of his own addiction and then forged a path for countless others to follow. With Bill as its driving force, A.A. grew from a handful of men to a worldwide fellowship of over 2 million men and women - a success that made him an icon within A.A., but also an alcoholic unable to be a member of the very society he had created. A reluctant hero, Bill Wilson lived a life of sacrifice and service, and left a legacy that continues every day, all around the world.","popularity":0.1642,"poster_path":"/xndrcDsVkn1H1cGuChqeMLxp3Dw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bill W.","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1044251,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Carracino","original_name":"Dan Carracino","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6086c7132da846002983861e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1044252,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kevin Hanlon","original_name":"Kevin Hanlon","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6086c72755c926004174b3ac","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3068176,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Patrick Gambuti Jr.","original_name":"Patrick Gambuti Jr.","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6086c74d55c926002b7ab58d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1044251,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Carracino","original_name":"Dan Carracino","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6086c75f2c6b7b0070ed3caf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1044252,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kevin Hanlon","original_name":"Kevin Hanlon","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6086c76933a5330040d252df","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1475288,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gil Talmi","original_name":"Gil Talmi","popularity":0.0953,"profile_path":"/tCF96xaAo3ODVxrd5pcLOvmZC4x.jpg","credit_id":"6086c7778d22fc007724a96b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937661,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ryo Murakami","original_name":"Ryo Murakami","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6086c788960cde006f0ca546","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3068176,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Patrick Gambuti Jr.","original_name":"Patrick Gambuti Jr.","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6086c795532acb005887f042","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1044251,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Carracino","original_name":"Dan Carracino","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a9fc3a36847f81d8add","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1044252,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kevin Hanlon","original_name":"Kevin Hanlon","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a9fc3a36847f81d8ae3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2275549","wikidata_id":"Q4911248","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xndrcDsVkn1H1cGuChqeMLxp3Dw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
