She likes it, she's a natural, and she's attracted to Bruno, the quiet instructor. He likes her as well, but sees social class as a barrier, and Yves never seems to be too far away. Valérie's two close friends have their own stories: Annette is continuously looking for a husband, with little luck. Clara cares more about wealth and power, and takes up with the country's finance minister, an older man who flips for her. Meanwhile, Yves's lover doesn't seem in a hurry to leave her husband, so Valérie looks good to him from time to time. Will Bruno ever make a move?","popularity":0.2507,"poster_path":"/yAfnlg7bnuQuuUzV56Zr4mER2jp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vive nous!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dieudonné","original_name":"Dieudonné","popularity":0.1227,"profile_path":"/hcAXaCmKECdvW3pXZYseJs9JJBG.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Bruno","credit_id":"54fdb52ec3a3684711004e80","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":31390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michèle Bernier","original_name":"Michèle Bernier","popularity":0.1866,"profile_path":"/8ivozzgDM1X9Ib5D7XqEWAPJzEL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Annette","credit_id":"536a3a6d0e0a2647d4009e6f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Prévost","original_name":"Daniel Prévost","popularity":0.3226,"profile_path":"/oXgHTf056G7gjS290Nadn05CbPT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Alain Leroy","credit_id":"536a3a7c0e0a2647d1009d19","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":238383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camille de Casabianca","original_name":"Camille de Casabianca","popularity":0.0518,"profile_path":"/zxgDb1s2c3ipYhI9xfexDmSJQCX.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Valérie","credit_id":"536a3a900e0a2647ce009c5c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":19117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emmanuelle Devos","original_name":"Emmanuelle Devos","popularity":0.3593,"profile_path":"/bX1l2sTxoXVMRBky7rfD3lVEHud.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Clara","credit_id":"536a3aa10e0a2647ce009c61","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19361,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thibault de Montalembert","original_name":"Thibault de Montalembert","popularity":0.4184,"profile_path":"/rlmatSXCig3KrEeTh1yKVTOZnMc.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Yves","credit_id":"536a3ab20e0a2647c800a442","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pascal Elbé","original_name":"Pascal Elbé","popularity":0.5695,"profile_path":"/hLjPLuVHhMC10LcOTcxvB5vtfRh.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Marc","credit_id":"536a3ac20e0a2647d1009d1e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ged Marlon","original_name":"Ged Marlon","popularity":0.1431,"profile_path":"/yIMobPDsKU7NTHXysxmbEHwLlZO.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Lulu","credit_id":"536a3ad90e0a2647c800a448","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corinne Vauvillé","original_name":"Corinne Vauvillé","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Mamy","credit_id":"536a3af60e0a2647d800a102","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorella Cravotta","original_name":"Lorella Cravotta","popularity":0.198,"profile_path":"/yhg52W7DcDMTYEFxxiOiqz9ba7A.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Lawyer","credit_id":"536a3b0f0e0a2647d1009d24","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":238383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camille de Casabianca","original_name":"Camille de Casabianca","popularity":0.0518,"profile_path":"/zxgDb1s2c3ipYhI9xfexDmSJQCX.jpg","credit_id":"59d3cf2e9251414b8b0028c4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0229022","wikidata_id":"Q3561509","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j9d1dh5FwEdppTisVJOLg5Fdv3J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zCPQJfj8Wk4a0l3B2qFlEAqJTm0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Hjtw3vCelKMagrFJYcleNZAfcL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.72,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/yAfnlg7bnuQuuUzV56Zr4mER2jp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540},{"aspect_ratio":0.738,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/26m4hd1ZToae98VvaFOkBcSTOmX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":738}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
