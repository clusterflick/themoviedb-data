Before she can even call her parents to let them know where she'll be, the lodge owners arrange her transport and she soon finds herself with two other young women as guests of a kindly old couple. The place is beautiful and the food is fantastic, but something just doesn't seem right. One of the guests has suddenly vanished, and the hosts are certainly reluctant to have anyone poking around the meat locker. Still, the barbecued ribs are delicious, so what's there to complain about?","popularity":0.8974,"poster_path":"/4hgLXROOwGem7rHxn9kV7gWUqO6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60770,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Wolf Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":41243,"logo_path":null,"name":"Far West","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1972-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's a nice place to visit, but you WOULDN'T LIVE THERE!","title":"Terror at Red Wolf Inn","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":15,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Terror House","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Secrets Beyond the Door","type":"Reissue Title"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Terror on the Menu","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Terror at the Red Wolf Inn","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Club Dead","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Folks at Red Wolf Inn","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Terror en el men√∫","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":198980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Gillen","original_name":"Linda Gillen","popularity":0.3189,"profile_path":"/eBKGY0I86SlTpdpD7FLVezUSkfz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Regina McKee","credit_id":"52fe4aa2c3a36847f81d97ab","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1044856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Neilson","original_name":"John Neilson","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/mWQfM194ESrYO7Mzr8cgEUmVPiJ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Baby John Smith","credit_id":"52fe4aa2c3a36847f81d97af","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Space","original_name":"Arthur Space","popularity":0.2936,"profile_path":"/1Knee5z0h89xsRWQIdCl1sd6DDf.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Henry Smith","credit_id":"52fe4aa2c3a36847f81d97b3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":44613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janet Wood","original_name":"Janet Wood","popularity":0.2936,"profile_path":"/3NSkro2ChiKLhwsxDqlTrJZmhev.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Pamela","credit_id":"52fe4aa2c3a36847f81d97b7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":84631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Jackson","original_name":"Mary Jackson","popularity":0.3129,"profile_path":"/fLrCF0ZctgkrwxjOuwcBRaJYPnF.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Evelyn Smith","credit_id":"58e988319251413ce400b858","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Avery","original_name":"Margaret Avery","popularity":0.4077,"profile_path":"/pvAB2GwE8QCPo7WxwBW7ndqUoPR.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Edwina","credit_id":"52fe4aa2c3a36847f81d97bb","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101744,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Macready","original_name":"Michael Macready","popularity":0.0791,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Jonathan the Deputy","credit_id":"58e9883dc3a36872ee06d01a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1792424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Earl Parker","original_name":"Earl Parker","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Paul the Pilot","credit_id":"58e98847c3a3684aa4058bca","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":97960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bud Townsend","original_name":"Bud Townsend","popularity":1.4,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4aa2c3a36847f81d97a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1267650,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Allen J.
