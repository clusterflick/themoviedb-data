Lowry’s death, this landmark documentary will bring to light a newly discovered treasure trove of unheard audio tapes recorded with the artist during the final four years of his life.  From the comfort of his own living room and inner sanctuary, we’ll hear from Lowry himself, his real voice lip-synced by one of our greatest actors. Taking us from the beginning of his life to the very end, he will reveal the formative memories and experiences that shaped him as an artist, and as a person.  This immersive documentary will foreground the touching, charming exchange between the enigmatic Lowry and his often surprising interviewer, a young researcher called Angela. But Lowry’s personal narrative also tells a bigger story, of a seismically changing Greater Manchester, where he lived, worked and painted so prolifically.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":16049,"logo_path":"/2hb0R2GJ6BvgwmyqO7fIgtjsakt.png","name":"Wall to Wall","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":17179,"logo_path":null,"name":"BBC Arena","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lowry: The Lost Tapes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3078319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"L.S.
