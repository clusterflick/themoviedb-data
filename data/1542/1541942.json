She’s socially isolated and manages her internal rage by drawing comics. One day, her apartment complex hires a new janitor: Hakim, a penniless immigrant whom Manuela befriends.Whitewash looks at the pressure felt amongst Iranian immigrants in Canada to change their given names to Western names to increase their chance of getting a job, and the consequences that develop due to this act of cultural and identity erasure.
