But an attempt to show off his find to his peers turns into a disaster - Artyom is laughed at, because most people see ordinary toys rather than fairy-tale characters. The magic portal disappears, leaving Pooh and his friends in the human world. 20 years later, Artyom, who has forbidden himself to dream and has sunk into routine, finds Winnie the Pooh again, and with him a chance to return the lost meaning to his life. But to do this, they all have to find Piglet, Rabbit and Owl, scattered across different corners of the country, and send them all back to their native Enchanted Forest.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":46939,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nashe Kino","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":7501,"logo_path":"/hz8piJ9Np1MswUyav0JDNGf42pO.png","name":"Soyuzmultfilm","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2027-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Винни Пух и все-все-все","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Vinni Pukh i vse-vse-vse","type":"Transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1265147,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vasily Rovensky","original_name":"Василий Ровенский","popularity":0.3497,"profile_path":"/tzHUJ2ElcNkvrG8auKtCElzc7r0.jpg","credit_id":"68b973632ac2f5635f1bb4e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1265147,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vasily Rovensky","original_name":"Василий Ровенский","popularity":0.3497,"profile_path":"/tzHUJ2ElcNkvrG8auKtCElzc7r0.jpg","credit_id":"68b9737770d14bf26c1f40d2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1265147,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vasily Rovensky","original_name":"Василий Ровенский","popularity":0.3497,"profile_path":"/tzHUJ2ElcNkvrG8auKtCElzc7r0.jpg","credit_id":"68b9737d0338726d8c1f4046","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2569062,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yuliana Slashcheva","original_name":"Юлиана Слащева","popularity":0.0848,"profile_path":"/w1LXdqhmR6TD8waf1kviPPkmvbn.jpg","credit_id":"68b97389b70c82581b9bf358","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2023972,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maxim Rogalsky","original_name":"Максим Рогальский","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b97397a6058281d71f3faf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2065763,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fedor Derevyansky","original_name":"Федор Деревянский","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b973a088213c5ba71bb5b5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3579525,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elvira Bushtets","original_name":"Эльвира Буштец","popularity":0.0855,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b973a7f77921dc4598aef3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37190812","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"0+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2027-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
