Culled from actual classroom prints and public-service shorts, these grainy time capsules mix jittery jazz cues, sensational warnings, and unforgettable visual metaphors (demons, downward spirals, and very bad dates) to illustrate the “evils” of drugs. Equal parts camp and cultural artifact, it’s a fascinating look at how schools taught vice and virtue—complete with period slang, square authority figures, and vintage poster-art charm.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Pills, thrills, and public-service chills.","title":"Classroom Scare Films Vol. 1: Drug Evils","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
