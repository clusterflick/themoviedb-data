The cave was regularly occupied in prehistoric times, and a remarkable record of human habitation going back thousands of years has been preserved by its soils. In 2015, the remains of a Neanderthal were uncovered, and the archaeological evidence points to this individual, named Thorin, living in close proximity to newly arrived Homo sapiens. This documentary follows an international team of scientists as they discover and investigate precious relics of the Paleolithic period, resulting in groundbreaking revelations about the human populations of around 50,000 years ago as researchers uncover some of the secrets of the Mandrin Cave.","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":16630,"logo_path":"/xEjkqz7Ow5tTMUx715YDdvEBAgi.png","name":"BBC Four","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2025-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lost Neanderthals","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1504794,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fiona Hampton","original_name":"Fiona Hampton","popularity":0.1595,"profile_path":"/yBbOR2LdCC5HSAbVGebNpAqLe50.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"68b9e341db06f191e69bf4ff","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1487421,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pascal Cuissot","original_name":"Pascal Cuissot","popularity":0.3218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b9e32425f494771c4e5191","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
