Advitya follows a young man who absorbs knowledge from books, the internet, and life, only to realize a harsh truth: India will never change unless its people change first. He sparks a dangerous yet inspiring idea — “Don’t wait for leaders or systems. The problem, and the solution, is within us.” His words ignite a silent revolution, spreading across villages and cities. Feared by power, branded a threat, the government bans the internet and hunts him down. But every attempt to silence him only strengthens his voice, as people carry his message forward. Traveling in disguise, living as one among the masses, Advitya becomes more than a man — he becomes a movement. And the question remains: will one boy’s fire light the nation, or will the system crush him before dawn?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Advitya","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt38133402","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
