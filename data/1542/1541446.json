In 1997, a man named Mel Waters called into a late night radio show claiming he had found a bottomless pit in the woods of Washington state. According to Waters, the hole devours sound, light, and time. Decades later, in the fog-wrapped forests of the Pacific Northwest, park ranger Sam stumbles upon that same legend. Sam finds this dark secret in the woods, one that returns what’s given, is changed forever, or sinks into oblivion.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Mockingbird is a slow-burn meditation on loss, myth, and the horrifying cost of letting go.","title":"Mockingbird","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27192577","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
