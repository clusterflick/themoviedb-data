The baby falls asleep only to the song of Falcon, who is singing battle songs, in other words, chooses the profession of a soldier. Traditionally it's considered a patriotic song: in the country that survived genocide, Soviet regime and recent war with Azerbaijan, sons' primary vocation is to become soldiers. This interpretation is dedicated to Mothers of all soldiers.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":273265,"logo_path":null,"name":"In Parenthesis","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","name":"Armenia"}],"release_date":"2005-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Armenian","iso_639_1":"hy","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Mother is calling Falcon to sing a battle song as a lullaby to an Armenian boy.","title":"Armenian Lullaby","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2238616,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irina Patkanian","original_name":"Irina Patkanian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ba5946a0a80ad1114e51e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5671483,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rafael Patkanian","original_name":"Rafael Patkanian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ba595b9d4617380e98b264","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1790728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lilit Pipoyan","original_name":"Lilit Pinoian","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/cgyRjUSGzeFFAY15QlHMYLiei1E.jpg","credit_id":"68ba5b7146a23182a29bf6f7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2238616,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irina Patkanian","original_name":"Irina Patkanian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ba5b910e912a38e606908d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1293838,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vardan Hovhannisyan","original_name":"Vardan Hovhannisyan","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ba5bb8bf527c93a54e53cc","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1537391","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6520,"name":"armenia"},{"id":215443,"name":"armenian"},{"id":352655,"name":"armenian culture"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hy","note":"","release_date":"2005-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
