Residents hold a week-long festival in May celebrating the island's queer spaces and community, encouraging the younger generation to claim the space as their own. The documentary follows residents and visitors and those who are a part of it - attendees, organisers and performers as they discuss the generational handing-of-the-baton to the younger queers who are starting to visit the island.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/qirgRQofjWmssGBXwGBTyQBYRTj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ranch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qirgRQofjWmssGBXwGBTyQBYRTj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
