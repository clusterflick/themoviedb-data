One man (portrayed by Anthony Martinez-Briggs), working inside a hospital during the COVID pandemic, comes to grasp the volatility of what it means to be “essential.” The other (portrayed by Ross Beschler) frantically parrots President Trump’s rhetoric.  This digital production, directed by Wilma Artistic Director Blanka Zizka, takes its inspiration from absurdist theater (such as Beckett’s \"Not I\"), and the Wilma HotHouse Company’s bold physical performance style.  The title, Code Blue, refers to the hospital code indicating an emergency when a patient enters cardiac arrest.","popularity":0.0882,"poster_path":"/1ChVOA0vDljz7OqyWAfjMu1efz3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Two men, caught in the chaos of contemporary America.","title":"Code Blue","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1102640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Martinez-Briggs","original_name":"Anthony Martinez-Briggs","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/hteDWo3hckz4NO2Z44nZLUfIwgm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Man 1","credit_id":"5f0de4c51a32480037cef713","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1128235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ross Beschler","original_name":"Ross Beschler","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/rkzwCX2n4gJuj2EIe4Hwb23X7EJ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Man 2","credit_id":"5f0de4d213a32000347d46da","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2712201,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Thom Weaver","original_name":"Thom Weaver","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0de4f113a3200035827e06","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2712202,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Vasilija Zivanic","original_name":"Vasilija Zivanic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0de504d5dbc20037e4921a","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2712204,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Taj Rauch","original_name":"Taj Rauch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0de515d5dbc20035e56fa4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1102640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Martinez-Briggs","original_name":"Anthony Martinez-Briggs","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/hteDWo3hckz4NO2Z44nZLUfIwgm.jpg","credit_id":"5f0de536109dec0037e50fd9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2712205,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Blanka Zizka","original_name":"Blanka Zizka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0de54181c7be0032fd45f9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2712204,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Taj Rauch","original_name":"Taj Rauch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0de581109dec0037e51062","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2712205,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Blanka Zizka","original_name":"Blanka Zizka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0de59f13a32000347d474d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1ChVOA0vDljz7OqyWAfjMu1efz3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-06-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
