Either way, to paint someone's picture is a unique way of really getting under their skin. In a world where anyone can make a realistic likeness on their cellphone, the importance of the painted portrait remains: as an emblem of power and prestige, as a political act and ultimately as a memorial. These themes and many others are explored through the work of three of Ireland's most notable portrait painters: James Hanley, Mick O'Dea and Brian Maguire.","popularity":0.0616,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Beholder","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074623,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Conor Horgan","original_name":"Conor Horgan","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0e637ed18fb90036617b03","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1592880","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jameson Dublin International Film Festival","release_date":"2010-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
