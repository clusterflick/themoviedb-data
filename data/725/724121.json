Chakravarthy and a family of three generations of trans-gendered female subjects, Aasha, Seetha and Dhana, who are bound together by ties of adoption. They all belong to the trans-gendered community called Aravanis (aka Hijras, in some parts of India). The film juxtaposes the ‘normality’ of their existence with the dark and powerful narrative by Pritham- ‘Nirvanam’; Nirvanam (Liberation) refers to the act of liberating oneself from the male body and transforming oneself to a female. This narrative bears witness to the tumultuous journey towards a reinvented selfhood, a journey fraught with violence, exploitation, affection and courage. The pains, pleasures and dilemmas of becoming the ‘other’ is the motif of the film. Weaving together performance, life histories and everyday life, it problematises the divides between ‘us’ and ‘them’.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/hPnwRFfAQryqZ0LtjCJPe8Vho6h.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2007-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tamil","iso_639_1":"ta","name":"தமிழ்"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Family","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2710825,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anjali Monteiro","original_name":"Anjali Monteiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0c55645e12000036ee7569","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2710827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"K.P.
