Out of all 3,800 employees, 70 percent are guest workers, the majority of them women. The women migrant workers demonstrate against the difference in pay between men and women, demanding »one more Mark«, and call for better general living and working conditions.  The compilation film documents the strike. In consultation with the strikers, film-makers Edith Schmidt-Marcello and David H. Wittenberg assembled the material, filmed by various people who experienced the strike first-hand, and supplemented it with their own film footage. The film was shown at numerous solidarity events and was the public relations vehicle for the workers and the works council. It was never shown on television and was initially forgotten.","popularity":0.0553,"poster_path":"/eqEZdcvqXF402kQknaHiHFmUT5o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pierburg: Ihr Kampf ist unser Kampf","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2199625,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Edith Schmidt","original_name":"Edith Schmidt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0ec43f51a64e00356d16c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2042270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David H.
