Philippe Leonard shot the footage for this remarkable work at Times Square, in New York City, during the hours of artificial illumination. Partly for this reason, it is an oneiric diary, tempted by myth and, at the same time, suffused by a melancholy sense that myth has lost its magical power. Faces appear and disappear in spasmodic waves of light, which emanate from billboards and mobile telephone screens and confuse the boundary between the organic and the artificial. The dilation of time and the miniaturization that that enables in [T] also ensures that the momentary betrayal of excitement, suspicion, attraction, hesitation, boredom and relief that traverses these faces approaches pure physicality.\"  - Rosalind Morris","popularity":0.0554,"poster_path":"/2aMkESNcmrd90kAkvJQuYZUthhV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"[T]","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2595819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philippe Léonard","original_name":"Philippe Léonard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/x1t9p8NkCCtvjbQRqygTd2fbW6y.jpg","credit_id":"5f108da46dea3a0033f0262c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1660385,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jefre Cantu-Ledesma","original_name":"Jefre Cantu-Ledesma","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f108dbadff66e00357b6fde","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2aMkESNcmrd90kAkvJQuYZUthhV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Anthology Film Archives, New York City","release_date":"2015-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"[T] - Preview Copy","key":"126217351","site":"Vimeo","size":720,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2015-04-28T03:18:41.000Z","id":"5f1092d16dea3a0035f1353c"}]}}}
