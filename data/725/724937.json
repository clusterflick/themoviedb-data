The performance uses photocells to transform light variations into electrical signals and thus, into sound. It can be shown as a single-channel projection, live performance or installation; it all depends on the context where it is shown as well as the state of mind of the moment. Every time it is shown, the editing changes as well as the approach of the sound/image relationship to convey the natural instability of one's brain activity. The piece has also been performed with musicians reacting to the visuals in conjunction with the photocells which are output to their set up, insuring a certain synchronization.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/mzByKBI3gukHehXlyotajNXupg7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"State of Mind","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2595819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philippe Léonard","original_name":"Philippe Léonard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/x1t9p8NkCCtvjbQRqygTd2fbW6y.jpg","credit_id":"5f1086f0dff66e00377e0169","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mzByKBI3gukHehXlyotajNXupg7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"State of Mind","key":"59979026","site":"Vimeo","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2013-02-19T09:43:49.000Z","id":"5f1092962495ab003238afd5"}]}}}
