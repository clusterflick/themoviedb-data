To show their solidarity with their husbands on strike, workers' wives invaded the director's office and obtained in two hours what was refused to them for months. But the management complained and sued. Twelve wives were charged with forcible confinement. The mobilization then widened. The women called on the Bretagne Cinema Production Unit (UPCB) to make a film about their struggle. Narrating the courageous action of solidarity of women with the strikers of the factory and the emergence of a collective awareness, both feminist and working-class, the film is also an echo chamber sensitive to the aspirations of the twelve women who were charged.","popularity":0.0953,"poster_path":"/6zokp09iHaVSvf2V4kIbVJlyYaF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quand les femmes ont pris la colère","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2713258,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Soazig Chappedelaine","original_name":"Soazig Chappedelaine","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0f3cad60620a0035832d25","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":2603989,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Clément","original_name":"Pierre Clément","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0f3c830231f20039fdb1ee","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"René Vautier","original_name":"René Vautier","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":"/aN9ghcXiG4z0OtF8QKfbLzPwd3v.jpg","credit_id":"5f0f3b15fba6250034204aa5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2713258,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Soazig Chappedelaine","original_name":"Soazig Chappedelaine","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0f3b936818880036aaea0b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1364381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruno Muel","original_name":"Bruno Muel","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0f3c961da7a60038153d01","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1364382,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Théo Robichet","original_name":"Théo Robichet","popularity":0.0677,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffaab9dafa1b0003fc1628a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2930259,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Maryvonne Le Brishoual","original_name":"Maryvonne Le Brishoual","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ffaabad021cee0041aa0ebb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0323746","wikidata_id":"Q109317149","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6zokp09iHaVSvf2V4kIbVJlyYaF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1333}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"1978-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
