After a strong typhoon toppled the house 40 years ago, the pillars were moved to the Institute of Ethnology Museum. Recently young villagers, with assistance from female shamans, pushed the descendants and village representatives to communicate with ancestors in the pillars. They eventually brought the ancestral souls rather than the pillars back and began reconstructing the house.","popularity":0.1883,"poster_path":"/b0Mr0hwBKXfubvK17geE8nF2kgb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2012-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Returning Souls","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2522007,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hu Tai-Li","original_name":"Hu Tai-Li","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/sHbKZtuCYoEIHaugLEo3O39JD0d.jpg","credit_id":"63419ae1b18f3200797dee52","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1376080,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kurt Stallmann","original_name":"Kurt Stallmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634a301ce22d280089c3b0ae","department":"Sound","job":"Music Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1785474,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lee Jong-Wang","original_name":"Lee Jong-Wang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634a31e65aadc4007a7b926f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2522007,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hu Tai-Li","original_name":"Hu Tai-Li","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/sHbKZtuCYoEIHaugLEo3O39JD0d.jpg","credit_id":"634990eae263bb009c4eeddc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2522007,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hu Tai-Li","original_name":"Hu Tai-Li","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/sHbKZtuCYoEIHaugLEo3O39JD0d.jpg","credit_id":"5f106b831684f700389ce69d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2022518","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b0Mr0hwBKXfubvK17geE8nF2kgb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":209619,"name":"aborigine"},{"id":251150,"name":"cultural identity"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
