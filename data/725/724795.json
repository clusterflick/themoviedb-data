Will the charismatic traveling preacher who sets his sights on her soul be her salvation, or her downfall? Carlisle Floyd’s all-American score, which beautifully evokes the work’s rural Appalachian setting, “is unabashedly neo-Romantic” (The New York Times). The radiant Patricia Racette sings the title role, with Brandon Jovanovich as her brother and Raymond Aceto as the hell-raising itinerant preacher. Conductor Karen Kamensek makes her San Francisco Opera debut in this eagerly awaited Company premiere directed by Michael Cavanagh.","popularity":0.052,"poster_path":"/t9Ao9TXlACC0u4hB3pfOCdfp0TY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20863,"logo_path":null,"name":"San Francisco Opera","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Susannah","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1564370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Racette","original_name":"Patricia Racette","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/5mKLGL5E43tOR9JOvhQr6JGYXNv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Susannah Polk","credit_id":"5f0fbbffdcf87500369dfbb4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2713645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandon Jovanovich","original_name":"Brandon Jovanovich","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sam Polk","credit_id":"5f0fbc06dcf87500369dfbd0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1587226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Aceto","original_name":"Raymond Aceto","popularity":0.0672,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Olin Blitch","credit_id":"5f0fbc0f20e6a500349f8b73","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2713646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Kryshak","original_name":"James Kryshak","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Little Bat McLean","credit_id":"5f0fbc16dcf87500379db479","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2713647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dale Travis","original_name":"Dale Travis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Elder McLean","credit_id":"5f0fbc1f20e6a500319fd03b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2713648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"A.
