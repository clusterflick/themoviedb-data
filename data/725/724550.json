The area is still uninhabited - residents were once told that they would only be relocated temporarily. The experiments were supposed to act as a deterrent to the end of all wars. In contrast to the residents, nature seems to offer greater resistance. The ships were gradually taken over by the seaweed underwater and the abandoned bunkers were overgrown with new vegetation. However, the radioactivity remains invisible and the soil will be contaminated for millions of years. The plants growing again here are also radioactive.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/8LWdFapesmBIGGnMRzM7605pMrq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Iroojrilik","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2712747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julian Charrière","original_name":"Julian Charrière","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0e97915c071b0034716217","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":2475,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8LWdFapesmBIGGnMRzM7605pMrq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1674}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
