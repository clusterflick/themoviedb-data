Producer and host Caroline Cory, who has her own extensive experience in the field of Consciousness Studies and Extra Sensory Perception, takes the viewers on an extraordinary journey to achieve tangible and measurable proof of these seemingly miraculous phenomena. Through a series of groundbreaking scientific experiments and demonstrations, viewers will find themselves connecting the dots about the true nature of their own consciousness, the relation between mind and matter and discover whether they live in a simulated matrix or if they can have control over their physical reality and create a fulfilling human experience. The film ultimately shows that once the invisible worlds are made visible, this attained higher awareness will transform humans into superhumans.","popularity":1.9839,"poster_path":"/b505VZaLGXas8DMEP8ifL6jtrMc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Superhuman: The Invisible Made Visible","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corey Feldman","original_name":"Corey Feldman","popularity":1.8049,"profile_path":"/9n5xDsrBFY0AFESmXOJEzEj4ezx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f2e4f0e699fb70038f72cc3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Dorn","original_name":"Michael Dorn","popularity":0.7,"profile_path":"/6mVjb0YsidC0gW9P8mXMkQirfcK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f2e4f216e938a0038b4aa94","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1454845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naomi Grossman","original_name":"Naomi Grossman","popularity":0.3148,"profile_path":"/gcuTmKNEZNrzZP4pPWRP4zLvWbM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f2e4f3af48b340035ae2dec","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":83274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachele Brooke Smith","original_name":"Rachele Brooke Smith","popularity":0.2056,"profile_path":"/7BscihtFdWG1Mntq1L3IO2hj5g8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f2e4f4d0c0b380033dc4258","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2643367,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caroline Cory","original_name":"Caroline Cory","popularity":0.1438,"profile_path":"/11WHo1M1unN8q0K8HL6ijUas9At.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f2e4f600c0b380032dd45ce","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1333003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul H.
