Occasionally reaching up to tweak the amplifier or manipulate the guitar pedal to produce screeching and howling feedback, Parrino uses the instruments unconventionally so that together they project a discordant noise. The artist masterfully draws the listener in to hear repetitions, subtle variations, and musical gestures in the unusual sonic palette. Shot by a lone cameraperson, the visuals of Parrino's performance become increasingly abstract as the music develops into a more familiar and alluring language.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/95NlLz44ELcVQZKu1mBHTIBHtpH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guitar Grind","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2713965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Parrino","original_name":"Steven Parrino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f1049282495ab003535355b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2713965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Parrino","original_name":"Steven Parrino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f10491d6dea3a0032f12806","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2713965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Parrino","original_name":"Steven Parrino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f10490d6dea3a0034eec13e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2713965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Parrino","original_name":"Steven Parrino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1049146743fa0035d328db","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/95NlLz44ELcVQZKu1mBHTIBHtpH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Gagosian Online - Broadcast: Alternate Meanings in Film and Video","release_date":"2020-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
