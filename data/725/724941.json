At precise intervals, the photosensitive surface recorded the constant flow of tourists, people-watchers, cars and animals as they moved, stopped, gathered, and took photos. The historic building thus reveals itself as a magnet whose pull on people has lasted for centuries. \"I Was Here\" is a reference to the common phrase often found scratched on public walls, marks left as visible proof of a person’s visit to a place. Like that age-old practice, travel photography is an attempt to record a person’s presence in a particular place – a photographed place taken home as proof.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/cBmq7bUvJ9AxvzYQcQdAPvpFXzY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2012-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Was Here","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2595819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philippe Léonard","original_name":"Philippe Léonard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/x1t9p8NkCCtvjbQRqygTd2fbW6y.jpg","credit_id":"5f1089ccdff66e00367d9fc6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2714202,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mark Lowe","original_name":"Mark Lowe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f108a002d8ef30037413d05","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cBmq7bUvJ9AxvzYQcQdAPvpFXzY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"I Was Here","key":"57796024","site":"Vimeo","size":720,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2013-01-20T17:44:10.000Z","id":"5f10915adff66e00377e2450"}]}}}
