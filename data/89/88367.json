But the rise of 1980s rock and new wave saw a decline in Simon's commercial success, and the singer responded by experimenting with different musical styles--most notably, world beat--that culminated in his adventurous 1986 masterpiece GRACELAND. The album's fusion of American folk-rock songwriting and buoyant South African rhythms not only broke new ground in pop music, but became Simon's biggest-selling solo record. This episode of the CLASSIC ALBUMS series examines the making of Simon's groundbreaking work through interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, music videos, and live performances of album tracks such as \"Boy in the Bubble,\" \"Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes,\" \"You Can Call Me Al,\" and \"Under African Skies.\"","popularity":1.3139,"poster_path":"/tzRhYnIIXZ3Ck99Xpfkkqdu8ufy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Classic Albums: Paul Simon - Graceland","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Simon","original_name":"Paul Simon","popularity":0.4562,"profile_path":"/vWOVDx7feNDSpgI2njivbCeFvEu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe49f29251416c910be0f9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2207864,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ray Phiri","original_name":"Ray Phiri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"616ce73b894ed60042f47a77","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1066340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Halee","original_name":"Roy Halee","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"632f35ec8efe73007999194c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1551,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Philip Glass","original_name":"Philip Glass","popularity":0.2814,"profile_path":"/dsf8ajHq4BJeTHdrwcM9OW72x4R.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"616ce920a097dc0065dfb367","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Simon","original_name":"Paul Simon","popularity":0.4562,"profile_path":"/vWOVDx7feNDSpgI2njivbCeFvEu.jpg","credit_id":"5e98c978f6596f0019ce0c91","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":231540,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Terry Shand","original_name":"Terry Shand","popularity":0.056,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e98c7ffb339030015a2bb88","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":933454,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bous De Jong","original_name":"Bous De Jong","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea073fb7aecc600257e8a77","department":"Production","job":"Co-Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":231538,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Geoff Kempin","original_name":"Geoff Kempin","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea06c94dd2589001dd1a073","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":587855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeremy Marre","original_name":"Jeremy Marre","popularity":0.064,"profile_path":"/x5EB9uwjUgpFElYGIWQRHNRwM1Q.jpg","credit_id":"5ec6f9a8140bad001d19af78","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":587855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeremy Marre","original_name":"Jeremy Marre","popularity":0.064,"profile_path":"/x5EB9uwjUgpFElYGIWQRHNRwM1Q.jpg","credit_id":"5ec6f99d140bad001d19af69","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0219064","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qAQbiuHXmI1HVwL7icvvwhhgt9K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tzRhYnIIXZ3Ck99Xpfkkqdu8ufy.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1136},{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":755,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4S3cIPHVkR0qDLihxqvlppfG0ar.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":535}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":33922,"name":"pop music"},{"id":193749,"name":"folk"},{"id":281554,"name":"rock"},{"id":337340,"name":"paul simon"},{"id":341580,"name":"\"graceland\""}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
