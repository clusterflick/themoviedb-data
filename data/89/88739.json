Don Ruggero is an iron-hearted man and strongly prejudiced against the lower classes. His son, Corrado, a young fellow, loves Rosalia, a shepherdess, but Don Ruggero has always refused to allow their marriage and to recognize little Vincenzino, their child, as his grandchild. Finally to destroy all Corrado's hopes, he discharges poor Rosalia from his farm, where she had been employed for many years. Even the sight of her departure with Vincenzino in her arms does not soften him. Rosalia is the very ideal of the Sicilian beauty, and Capt. Altieri, an officer in the service of the Dominators, the Bourbons, admires her immensely, but all his approaches are strongly repulsed by her. Don Ruggero and his son have for a long time conspired to free their motherland from the hands of the Bourbons, and when they receive news of the arrival of Garibaldi.","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15029,"logo_path":null,"name":"Societ√† Anonima Ambrosio","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1912-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Sicilian Heroine","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"I mille (Episodio dell'epopea garibaldina)","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":936485,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Bay","original_name":"Maria Bay","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4a019251416c910c00f3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":936486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vitale Di Stefano","original_name":"Vitale Di Stefano","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4a019251416c910c00f7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":936487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oreste Grandi","original_name":"Oreste Grandi","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4a019251416c910c00fb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":936488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Cleo Tarlarini","original_name":"Mary Cleo Tarlarini","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/xbi4jAhUk9MGDTmN5ZF2wtaTaBW.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4a019251416c910c00ff","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":936489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ercole Vaser","original_name":"Ercole Vaser","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4a019251416c910c0103","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":936490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cesare Zocchi","original_name":"Cesare Zocchi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4a019251416c910c0107","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":936463,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mario Caserini","original_name":"Mario Caserini","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a019251416c910c00e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":938387,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Giuseppe Cesare Abba","original_name":"Giuseppe Cesare Abba","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a019251416c910c0113","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":936484,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Degli Abbati","original_name":"Alberto Degli Abbati","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a019251416c910c00ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":938386,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vittorio Bravetta","original_name":"Vittorio Bravetta","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a019251416c910c010d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0187287","wikidata_id":"Q3791015","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1912-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1912-12-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
