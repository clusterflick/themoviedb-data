The story chronicles Glenn’s struggle as he tries to make sense of his life as a youngster, keeping his secret and shame inside, promising to tell no one. Quelling his pain as a teen through alcohol and drugs, he held tight to his secret. Glenn’s story is detailed by wrenching testimonials of his brothers and sister, his mother and father – who each recognized something was wrong with this once-golden-boy – but at a loss to understand the cause of his devastation.  After suffering for decades, living on the streets, addicted to alcohol and drugs and sex – Glenn finally came up for air. It tells of his past and his present…funny, poignant and sad. Glenn’s story is interspersed with those of twenty other boys-turned-men who share the same history. Their stories are all different…but unfortunately, all the same. One in six boys is sexually molested by the age of 16.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"I swore I'd never tell.\"","title":"Boyhood Shadows","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":936864,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Rosen","original_name":"Steve Rosen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a079251416c910c0df5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":936865,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Terri DeBono","original_name":"Terri DeBono","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a079251416c910c0dfb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Boyhood Shadows trailer.mov","key":"vsKFnoFHhAg","published_at":"2010-01-11T00:56:43.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6d4c3a3685448007c9d"}]}}}
