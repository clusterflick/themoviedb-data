Classic ski action cinematography at its best. Featured locations include Mammoth Mountain, CA, and an invitation-only spring racing derby; Mt Vernasus in Greece, which hosts a school for ski-ophytes; and some truly outrageous '70s freestyle action from Squaw Valley, Park City, Sun Valley, and Colorado's Breckenridge, Keystone, Copper and A-Basin resorts. Generous portions of Warren Miller's trademark humor and some crazy kaleidoscopic effects make \"Ski a la Carte\" the perfect sample of vintage 1970s Warren Miller.","popularity":0.1155,"poster_path":"/lozTxsiLEGnrTTsES7RanCuZ4ld.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17183,"logo_path":null,"name":"Warren Miller Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1978-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ski ala Carte","video":false,"vote_average":0.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Warren Miller's Ski a la Carte","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":936520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Warren Miller","original_name":"Warren Miller","popularity":0.2734,"profile_path":"/apsffolz1ltiYEJBDkQYMLHgKOb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"52fe4a039251416c910c0497","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":936520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Warren Miller","original_name":"Warren Miller","popularity":0.2734,"profile_path":"/apsffolz1ltiYEJBDkQYMLHgKOb.jpg","credit_id":"5c0062f79251411329063d8c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":936520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Warren Miller","original_name":"Warren Miller","popularity":0.2734,"profile_path":"/apsffolz1ltiYEJBDkQYMLHgKOb.jpg","credit_id":"5c0062ee9251411329063d7d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0222373","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nElfgQs1WNuVGb5aEYXuNLeK6Yp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lozTxsiLEGnrTTsES7RanCuZ4ld.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
