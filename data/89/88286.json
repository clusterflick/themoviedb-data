An aspiring actor stuck in a small town who has big plans of moving to Hollywood so he can strike it rich. One night, while on his way into a corner store, he meets Didi, a pretty but aimless girl hanging out in the parking lot. Mike and Didi strike up a conversation, and she discovers there's a big dose of self-doubt lurking beneath his confident exterior. Mike, on the other hand, finds that the longer he talks to Didi, the more he finds himself thinking she might be a good reason to stick around.","popularity":1.169,"poster_path":"/olbY2nk07bwUX09GLQq0xm43990.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
