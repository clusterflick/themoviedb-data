Although the kids are terrified, Marta Caldwell, the bus' Cuban-born driver, remains calm and collected throughout the ordeal, not only helping her charges survive the crisis, but also providing comfort and support to a teacher's aide on the verge of a diabetic seizure. But while Marta keeps her head about her, the kidnapper grows more and more unhinged, and the police surround the hijacked bus, ready to shoot to kill if necessary.","popularity":0.7525,"poster_path":"/4YvNE2rcuXG7MnH9EUs1SRDDsTP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":176162,"logo_path":"/gk4tb53F2nl3a0xcUNCYrlPIktC.png","name":"ABC","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10471,"logo_path":"/tHIwIKoXdLKA8Nt3XeRInh71OvD.png","name":"Columbia TriStar Television","origin_country":"US"},{"id":65380,"logo_path":null,"name":"Katie Face Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":120214,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oasis Entertainment Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sudden Terror: The Hijacking of School Bus #17","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Terror inesperado","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2051,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"María Conchita Alonso","original_name":"María Conchita Alonso","popularity":0.8435,"profile_path":"/zcDN921xNK0AznoA0TEbdbsPSn3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Marta Caldwell","credit_id":"52fe49e89251416c910bcc71","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":218798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcy Walker","original_name":"Marcy Walker","popularity":0.232,"profile_path":"/4xmc9kzuTcSNfHhGql4bnIrB1h6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lt.
