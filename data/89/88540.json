A few minus degrees are multiplied by the freezing onshore wind blowing at 30 m/s. A man changes into a 6mm wetsuit in the heavy storm, grabs a surfboard and heads towards the roaring waves. The temperature of the seawater is close to zero. It's freezing outside. What the hell...? FINNSURF is the world's first Finnish surf film. It's a freezing, and at the same time warm documentary of surfing in Finland, and in some other places as well. A world where life is a dream and dream is everyday life. This documentary tells a story of five Finnish surfers. Everyone has their own point of view on surfing, Finland and surfing in Finland.","popularity":0.0969,"poster_path":"/tSlin1Y8bMdow7oCBhDT4Cnwk3H.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Finnsurf","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":936241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kalle Carranza","original_name":"Kalle Carranza","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1001,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe49f99251416c910bf087","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":936242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rumon Chapman","original_name":"Rumon Chapman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1002,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe49f99251416c910bf08b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":936243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jukka Karhunen","original_name":"Jukka Karhunen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe49f99251416c910bf08f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":936244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aija Korhonen","original_name":"Aija Korhonen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1004,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe49f99251416c910bf093","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":936245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomi Lagerroos","original_name":"Tomi Lagerroos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1005,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe49f99251416c910bf097","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":936240,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Aleksi Raij","original_name":"Aleksi Raij","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49f99251416c910bf083","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2112951","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tSlin1Y8bMdow7oCBhDT4Cnwk3H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
