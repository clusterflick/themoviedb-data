As a matter of fact, it’s the only thing he’s really fond of. His main interest is horror films, and he uses a special technique to make them – drawing each shot on long strips of paper. He shows the films on a slide projector with a special live soundtrack. Rudolf ’s story illustrates the conflict between the imaginary world of a boy and the society surrounding him, where everybody expects him to live according to certain rules and dogmas. How does he cope with it? The biggest surprise comes when the local priest asks Rudolf to make a film to be played during the service.","popularity":0.1651,"poster_path":"/eK9owEMzaDIEdQCavs6Zo9e2UnD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85188,"logo_path":"/dt6pAG7kCbPrzwcp92NMxTGJyLJ.png","name":"Juris Podnieks Studio","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How Are You Doing, Rudolf Ming?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2921105,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rūdolfs Miķelsons","original_name":"Rūdolfs Miķelsons","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1008,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ff17467d2f5b500402ce5e6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":936247,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roberts Rubīns","original_name":"Roberts Rubīns","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49f99251416c910bf0a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":936248,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jānis Kalve","original_name":"Jānis Kalve","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49f99251416c910bf0a9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":936247,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roberts Rubīns","original_name":"Roberts Rubīns","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe56bcf72d855003dc4588b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1761335,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antra Cilinska","original_name":"Antra Cilinska","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":"/cCSilJuyy3zMESQ4TmdNcwyCbtH.jpg","credit_id":"5fe56beef14dad003dcf9e8f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1584911,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guna Stahovska","original_name":"Guna Stahovska","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe56c08cee4810040298678","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297711,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anrijs Krenbergs","original_name":"Anrijs Krenbergs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe56c1d70309f0040842c95","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2890451,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andris Vilcāns","original_name":"Andris Vilcāns","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe56c33136545003d5c2eaa","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1105430,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Uldis Jancis","original_name":"Uldis Jancis","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe56c501ac292003dba765a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2202449","wikidata_id":"Q20562230","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.718,"height":905,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eK9owEMzaDIEdQCavs6Zo9e2UnD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":650}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"How Are You Doing, Rudolf Ming? trailer","key":"wLJwka1qArE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2011-09-28T08:43:38.000Z","id":"6789bf0bc9e03e442d9766ad"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"HOW ARE YOU DOING, RUDOLF MING?","key":"19572063","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2011-02-04T17:54:29.000Z","id":"600a4252d55c3d003f6c2f69"}]}}}
