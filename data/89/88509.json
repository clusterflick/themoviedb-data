He's practically asking for trouble when he confronts a traffic cop who explains he is looking for speeders. Woody reveals himself to be a speeder by driving to Alaska and back in less than a minute. The cop tries to arrest him but Woody states, \"I bet ya wouldn't be so tough without that uniform.\" The officer undresses but Woody attacks him with a boxing glove camera. Woody also gets his goat by dressing as a farmer on horse-and-buggy and as a Chinaboy with rickshaw. Finally, the cop flips out and is sent to a mental hospital with Woody as his caretaker.","popularity":0.5428,"poster_path":"/eQYkZmZ2zuP44kdWC8vwraTFbfp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":"/x6HLTQILKcImVQ3GvVCwy35W5fz.png","name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1941-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Screwdriver","video":false,"vote_average":7.192,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Woody's Jalopy","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"O Biruta","type":"translation"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Screwdriver","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Blanc","original_name":"Mel Blanc","popularity":1.2076,"profile_path":"/8fevv4K06TmHsYom2XfmxgKrTcd.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Woody Woodpecker / Motorcycle Cop","credit_id":"52fe49f89251416c910bed49","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89284,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walter Lantz","original_name":"Walter Lantz","popularity":0.2364,"profile_path":"/zf5VLzWAmW1mvVMxnMLAJquhric.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49f89251416c910bed21","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111193,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Darrell Calker","original_name":"Darrell Calker","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49f89251416c910bed39","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":936213,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ralph Somerville","original_name":"Ralph Somerville","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49f89251416c910bed45","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558639,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Lovy","original_name":"Alex Lovy","popularity":0.1384,"profile_path":"/txGj5oXMl7rVvHwDQsOeichoFIH.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49f89251416c910bed3f","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":226492,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ben Hardaway","original_name":"Ben Hardaway","popularity":0.0833,"profile_path":"/rCoJqfF3QdX7YpGEEbWgRCRunZV.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49f89251416c910bed2d","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149270,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jack Cosgriff","original_name":"Jack Cosgriff","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49f89251416c910bed33","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89284,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walter Lantz","original_name":"Walter Lantz","popularity":0.2364,"profile_path":"/zf5VLzWAmW1mvVMxnMLAJquhric.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49f89251416c910bed27","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0152343","wikidata_id":"Q7762711","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1YrozmtDmmWV7lN6WZ7KiItCdzg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1410,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eQYkZmZ2zuP44kdWC8vwraTFbfp.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":940},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1170,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bWfBaxgkKIgAlrSiA0Z5a2zd1GH.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":780},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/nCCBclCpXriUWtrRAfBfum2JHU8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6513,"name":"cartoon"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1941-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
