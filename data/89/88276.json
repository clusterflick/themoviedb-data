It is named after Zorn's lemma (also known as the Kuratowski–Zorn lemma), a proposition of set theory formulated by mathematician Max Zorn in 1935.  Zorns Lemma is prefaced with a reading from an early grammar textbook. The remainder of the film, largely silent, shows the viewer an evolving 24-part \"alphabet\" (where i & j and u & v are interchanged) which is cycled through, replaced and expanded upon. The film's conclusion shows a man, woman and dog walking through snow as several voices read passages from On Light, or the Ingression of Forms by Robert Grosseteste.","popularity":0.3128,"poster_path":"/8z0EwuhLyyTuZwN2bXTsdoyWbZI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":223448,"logo_path":null,"name":"Word
