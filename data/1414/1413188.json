When the entire series is finished, the narrative paths that have been severed in the intervening time and space may intertwine, creating new curves. Tao Hui’s recent works are full of references and appropriations of emerging media forms. This time, he still uses the form of short social videos to create for the public, but his content is a departure from the mainstream: he takes the initiative to weaken the plot density, and instead presents the story in a poetic, weak narrative, multi-layered and multi-temporal way.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Similar Disguise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3265335,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tao Hui","original_name":"Tao Hui","popularity":0.1177,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677bafd855d4b38f9367158c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
