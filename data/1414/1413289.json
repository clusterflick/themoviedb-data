The images follow the main character the 'fairy' as she battles to understand her own mental health and how to survive in a world not built for her. She's lost and afraid. We then get introduced to the 'fox' who pray upon this and takes her down a dark twisted spiral of lies, abuse and control. A fairytale of gore, coercive control, manipulation and mental health depicted in 7 images.  Following, Ryan Robertson has been detailing the behind the scenes of the images within his documentary \"Spellbound:Framing Coercive Manipulation\" Which explores Mica's story, the creation of the images, artwork and the chilling music that ties it all together.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/skZK0z7LY0n3pv9svs5XKLKwN28.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spellbound Framing Coercive Manipulation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5162207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mica Ellie Hill","original_name":"Mica Ellie Hill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"677beac055d4b38f936723f1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5162926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nia Kelly","original_name":"Nia Kelly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"677c2f8b55d4b38f936732e5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5162927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alistair McBurnie","original_name":"Alistair McBurnie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"677c2f9a8fd6f5109d72e842","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5162924,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kayden Allan","original_name":"Kayden Allan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"677f0e2f12667968854e852c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5162923,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olivia Martin","original_name":"Olivia Martin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"677f0e73e0d56493e4bb1cb6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5167853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ffion evans","original_name":"Ffion evans","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"677f0e88e0d56493e4bb1cd9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5167859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruthie henry","original_name":"Ruthie henry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"677f0f193881c79419bb2c35","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5167862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amy jess","original_name":"Amy jess","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"677f0f4ac81acaa63dbb34b6","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5167867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shirley middleditch","original_name":"Shirley middleditch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"677f0fd012667968854e85e0","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5167868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niamh connoly","original_name":"Niamh connoly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Self","credit_id":"677f0fdec5d2e96e267b0045","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5162207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mica Ellie Hill","original_name":"Mica Ellie Hill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677beb2382cce15a76752158","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4119166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Robertson","original_name":"Ryan Robertson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/cF7QwC1At33KKYTrDhft4hDfXjH.jpg","credit_id":"677c2f0655d4b38f9367326b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5162923,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olivia Martin","original_name":"Olivia Martin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677c2f39d9b0e70d5d725b27","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5162924,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kayden Allan","original_name":"Kayden Allan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677c2f69d9b0e70d5d725b44","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4119166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Robertson","original_name":"Ryan Robertson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/cF7QwC1At33KKYTrDhft4hDfXjH.jpg","credit_id":"677c2f7a55d4b38f936732c5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1616,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/skZK0z7LY0n3pv9svs5XKLKwN28.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
