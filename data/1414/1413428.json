Stubborn in her faith, Joana refuses to flee to the mountains with her son while lonely elders succumb to the heat. One of them is the mother of Viktor, a gold miner who returns to the complex injured when his house is taken by the sea. Everyone flees while Joana stands firm, caring for Viktor and clinging to the unlikely return of her son — until a murder and scarcity transform her into the very thing she fears most.","popularity":0.0877,"poster_path":"/wVj6lEKnmR1SyX4liaUI8Gdtjfb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":216734,"logo_path":null,"name":"punktu","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2025-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heyari:
