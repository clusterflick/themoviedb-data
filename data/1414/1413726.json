After a short period of peaceful stay, some strange events begin to happen. Every night, Henry is promptly awakened by the same, identical, nightmare. From that moment, he finds himself trapped in his apartment: the door, bearing the words “Don't go out!, Walter”, is locked with chains and padlocks, the windows are hermetically sealed, the phone is silent and no one seems to hear his screams. After five days of captivity, a hole appears in the bathroom wall: Henry, armed only with an iron pipe, crosses the portal in search of freedom.
