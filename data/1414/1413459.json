It deals with the adventures of Willyum. a darky aviator, whose flight in an airship of his own make so closely resembles the journey of the inexperienced into Wall Street as to give the film its name. Wlllyum's balloon burst while he was in mid-air and down he came, but landed safely on a pole in the river, where he promptly started fishing, just as many persons fall from their dreamy soarings to the hard reality. While Willyum is fishing he falls asleep, just as many others do, and it is while he slumbers peacefully that things happen to him, and the funniest things imaginable, too.","popularity":0.0563,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1913-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Wall Street Wail","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1110408,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Randolph Bray","original_name":"John Randolph Bray","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/mdWa0YdpPaZvpprJqD2kRjDGuyg.jpg","credit_id":"677c4def25e0e91c5775234f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0363195","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1913-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
