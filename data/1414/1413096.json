To get it quickly, the leadership decides to blow up Arshaula mountain. But the mountain is considered \"sacred\" and, according to believers, is inviolable. The kulaks try to prevent andesite mining and spread rumors about the family of its head, Levan, and drag his wife, father-in-law, Berdia into the conflict and recruit them to their side. At the village meeting, it will finally be decided to blow up the mountain. The village will move to a new place, but Berdia continues to resist. Mojagire's purchase exposes him, which is why Birdia decides to kill him. Before the explosion, he goes to collect loot hidden in a tower near the mountain and takes the purchase with him. He finds himself trapped in the purchased tower and dies in the explosion. A horse loaded with property is in the hands of the militia, its owner is recognized and Berdia is arrested.","popularity":0.1258,"poster_path":"/u7eZ362iZbRuVfWVuvTaMS5GrjM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113190,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Georgia Film Academy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"}],"release_date":"1935-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arshaula","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","title":"არშაულა","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4726480,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cecilia Tsutsunava","original_name":"Cecilia Tsutsunava","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"widow","credit_id":"677b607f830a8f4cc766c49f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5161360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"qetevan japharidze","original_name":"qetevan japharidze","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"nunu","credit_id":"677b60bf4bf0f0e3b474c284","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1269902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zaali Terishvili","original_name":"Zaali Terishvili","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"677b60da2b097b15a274f9e8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3326062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaioz Meliava","original_name":"Gaioz Meliava","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"levani","credit_id":"677b60f04bf0f0e3b474c28d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5156974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elena Senicheva-Esakia","original_name":"ელენე სენიჩევა-ესაკია","popularity":0.1027,"profile_path":"/5brXGugCdanC9kyXASAId8vPF1j.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"677b61044bf0f0e3b474c299","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3682648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikoloz Mamulashvili","original_name":"Nikoloz Mamulashvili","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"677b613038d26a2a6372d410","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1808671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kohkta Karalashvili","original_name":"კოხტა კარალაშვილი","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":"/x2vmf7cxqiUpWzlrnLoy1thW7uF.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Koba","credit_id":"67d459c9a2b18dbedd6503bf","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1128427,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Davit Rondeli","original_name":"Davit Rondeli","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677b5ffc8fd6f5109d72cacd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3297408,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ilo Mosashvili","original_name":"Ilo Mosashvili","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677b601155d4b38f936709d2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1757065,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Davit Lomidze","original_name":"Davit Lomidze","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677b60444bf0f0e3b474c267","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2266180,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Serapion Vatsadze","original_name":"სერაფიონ ვაცაძე","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d47276506cc90d64028b97","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u7eZ362iZbRuVfWVuvTaMS5GrjM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ka","note":"","release_date":"1935-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
