Far from civilization, their days are punctuated by daily tasks such as preparing meals, the promise of marriage, armadillo hunting, childbirth, the death of a parent, ritual dances and also games of chance, much appreciated by adults. At the beginning of the 20th century, young people, attracted by the easy life of the cities, deserted their villages.
