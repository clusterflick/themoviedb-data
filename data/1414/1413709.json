Living in a small town, Pássaro and Marciano were best friends as children, despite the constant tension that surrounded their neighbors. However, fights between their parents drove them apart and their friendship faded. Years later, Pássaro and Ângelo meet again at a party and become attracted to each other, experiencing a passion that defies prejudice and stigma. The relationship, however, provokes Marciano's anger and hostility and rekindles resentments of the enmity between the families.","popularity":0.2181,"poster_path":"/jgpH7zG9OMDhMv0QoMzgYDIkRGS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":120563,"logo_path":null,"name":"Valkyria
