Through the story of a young murdered girl, she evokes the invisible but palpable presence of spirits and ancestors in a Haitian diaspora family living between Canada and the United States.  Ethereal, superimposed images unfold across Haitian landscapes, which, despite the ambient heat, appear to be bathed in a cold light. The funeral march emerges as a distant voice, a ballad, and a song from beyond the grave that combines nature, the sea, love and life after death.","popularity":0.0985,"poster_path":"/8MXdXgfT1gY3k3cKti2oNYxTjfJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This House","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1289774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Blain Mbaye","original_name":"Florence Blain Mbaye","popularity":0.1057,"profile_path":"/3Zzf3VEUigOlQ0ekEdY0xfy9gel.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"677d70dbd9b0e70d5d7288b4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2292019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Schelby Jean-Baptiste","original_name":"Schelby Jean-Baptiste","popularity":0.1199,"profile_path":"/toiD8bPEvyD8dPq7EBzQgY8kPmL.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"677d70e425e0e91c5775498d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2143278,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miryam Charles","original_name":"Miryam Charles","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":"/vz6mshHkSCgqGepTyMgBbcTWnDt.jpg","credit_id":"677d708e15cafe8aad74bb40","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1352,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8MXdXgfT1gY3k3cKti2oNYxTjfJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":901}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
