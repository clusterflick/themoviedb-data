The crime, committed during Pamplona's San Fermin celebrations in 2008 by a psychiatric intern, shook society and hit the media headlines as never before. The trial took place in November 2009, with the defendant being convicted of manslaughter. Asun, her family, and all those who support them, continue their struggle to see justice done and have the culprit sentenced for murder with intent. This documentary talks about Nagore's murder, converting it into an emblematic story representing the countless similar cases taking place throughout today's society.","popularity":0.4149,"poster_path":"/xsrW9HhKFQ4m4f4REgyzqk4m8Ky.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53440,"logo_path":"/vx5barQXjevofq6XO54tP8mAhnj.png","name":"Lamia Producciones","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2010-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nagore","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5052858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asun Casasola","original_name":"Asun Casasola","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1013,"character":"Self","credit_id":"673219d00f3f5a4a09a67f24","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5052859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Txomin Laffage","original_name":"Txomin Laffage","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1014,"character":"Self","credit_id":"673219dd0f3f5a4a09a67f43","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5052860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Javier Laffage","original_name":"Javier Laffage","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1015,"character":"","credit_id":"673219e6575d069d39fc5f7f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":933695,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helena Taberna","original_name":"Helena Taberna","popularity":0.0738,"profile_path":"/lhz3Bh6fHZzG57Knqf3BQH2k74c.jpg","credit_id":"52fe499c9251416c910b2fdd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":85554,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aránzazu Calleja","original_name":"Aránzazu Calleja","popularity":0.065,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644bc79c596a9102fc57dc30","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2594010,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"José Luis Pimoulier","original_name":"José Luis Pimoulier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0876fcd5ffcb0034857ab3","department":"Crew","job":"Photoscience Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":933695,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helena Taberna","original_name":"Helena Taberna","popularity":0.0738,"profile_path":"/lhz3Bh6fHZzG57Knqf3BQH2k74c.jpg","credit_id":"673218b46fc031824b086381","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2480569,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Iker Ganuza","original_name":"Iker Ganuza","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673218cb575d069d39fc5eb7","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1785160,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Raúl López","original_name":"Raúl López","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673218f6575d069d39fc5ed3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3869718,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Iñigo Tena","original_name":"Iñigo Tena","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67321901575d069d39fc5ee4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2461799,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aurelio Martinez","original_name":"Aurelio Martinez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673219164cee4fc8d5d190c7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5052852,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maite Miqueo","original_name":"Maite Miqueo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6732192e6fc031824b0863f1","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2149183,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrés Martorell","original_name":"Andrés Martorell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67321949ebc5a26e5e496d03","department":"Crew","job":"Documentation & Support"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1820556","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1432,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/xsrW9HhKFQ4m4f4REgyzqk4m8Ky.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1012}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11297,"name":"judgment"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":281523,"name":"gender violence"},{"id":326878,"name":"sanfermines"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Nagore Trailer","key":"HriejbMADPA","published_at":"2010-11-10T08:13:48.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6d3c3a3685448007b37"}]}}}
