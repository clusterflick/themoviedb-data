As they arrive, it turns out that not only the villagers have never heard of Dolniker, but they have also never heard of running water, electricity, phones, and most importantly: TV, Radio, and newspapers... so its only a matter of time before Dolniker or the villagers go bananas...","popularity":0.1438,"poster_path":"/uGgAdbRB3fIn9SpL9NVyHzDtHUM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fox in the Chicken Coop","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Ha-Shu'al B'Lool Hatarnagalot","type":"romanization"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":583400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shaike Ophir","original_name":"Shaike Ophir","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":"/n5iYrbbi7eFMR1KVKC9M6DVAOza.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Amitz Dolniker","credit_id":"52fe499c9251416c910b3049","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":583794,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seffy Rivlin","original_name":"Seffy Rivlin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/3At4HOqbaEpiOQc7hinVi2sx1gG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ze'ev","credit_id":"52fe499c9251416c910b304d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1214720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nitza Shaul","original_name":"Nitza Shaul","popularity":0.0809,"profile_path":"/dc1rP8gntPkAJoCxyFkaZb0MP8I.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Miss Goorevitch","credit_id":"52fe499c9251416c910b3051","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":25818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mosko Alkalai","original_name":"Mosko Alkalai","popularity":0.1017,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Tzemach Goorevitch","credit_id":"52fe499c9251416c910b3055","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":566722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ya'anckale Bodo","original_name":"Ya'anckale Bodo","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Zalaman Hasidov","credit_id":"52fe499c9251416c910b3059","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gideon Singer","original_name":"Gideon Singer","popularity":0.1354,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Prof. Tennebaum / Elifaz Hermanovitch","credit_id":"52fe499c9251416c910b305d","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":583399,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ephraim Kishon","original_name":"Ephraim Kishon","popularity":0.0686,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe499c9251416c910b303f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":583399,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ephraim Kishon","original_name":"Ephraim Kishon","popularity":0.0686,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe499c9251416c910b3045","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0078261","wikidata_id":"Q2906938","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vVvHJZbmn2ODIhHZ5FBkb4w4DC1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/tUibdPM54M1IXoevz2l856EhuXm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/uGgAdbRB3fIn9SpL9NVyHzDtHUM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
