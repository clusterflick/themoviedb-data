At the final news conference, Cotto warned Antonio Margarito, \"I'm going to slap you like a little girl.\"  I'm pretty sure Cotto hits harder than most little girls, and Margarito would probably agree. Cotto dominated for most of the match, and eventually won on a technical knockout in nine rounds.  As with all boxing matches, there are plenty of things to be learned about each fighter. As a result, I have compiled a list of four things we learned from Saturday night.
