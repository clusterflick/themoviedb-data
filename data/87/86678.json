This documentary is a fascinating look at the story of \"acid\" before it hit the streets.  Featuring interviews with many LSD pioneers, Hofmann's Potion is much more than a simple chronicle of the drug's early days. With thoughtful interviews, beautiful music and stunning cinematography, it is an invitation to look at LSD, and our world, with a more open, compassionate mind.","popularity":0.5487,"poster_path":"/aR4U714fQVgZcojzUbRGCQVuqsO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hofmann's Potion: The Pioneers of LSD","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Hofmann's Potion","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Hofmann's Potion: The Early Years of LSD","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stanislav Grof","original_name":"Stanislav Grof","popularity":0.1779,"profile_path":"/fhkbEjuhav6mHLsXWLolHOp1AmF.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe49959251416c910b216f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Hofmann","original_name":"Albert Hofmann","popularity":0.1958,"profile_path":"/v9zQ6pTSAUy7cC88152iwi7ux3q.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe49959251416c910b2173","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1029198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Humphry Osmond","original_name":"Humphry Osmond","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe49959251416c910b2177","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":582649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ram Dass","original_name":"Ram Dass","popularity":0.0964,"profile_path":"/k5zWibF8jND1J9vkt4oPYLSTOnV.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe49959251416c910b2181","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1029202,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Duncan Blewett","original_name":"Duncan Blewett","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe49969251416c910b2185","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1029203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abram Hoffer","original_name":"Abram Hoffer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe49969251416c910b2189","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1029205,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred M.
