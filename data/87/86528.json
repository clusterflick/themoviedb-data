Many founders were involved in secret societies, and yet it is often claimed these men were Christians who were trying to build a Christian nation. But was their faith the true faith of the Bible? And is it possible, as some claim, that the exact opposite is true?  What did the founders believe about the Person of Jesus Christ? Were they fighting for Christianity, or against it? Moreover, is it possible that the events of the American Revolution have a much darker significance in the pages of Bible prophecy than most church leaders are aware?","popularity":0.4629,"poster_path":"/agjPX1IwrdXbRn37WKiHn7x3p0d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48421,"logo_path":null,"name":"Adullam Films LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What did America's founding fathers actually think about the Gospel of Jesus Christ?","title":"The Hidden Faith of the Founding Fathers","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings Volume 4: Hidden Faith of the Founding Fathers","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Hidden Faith of the Founding Fathers","type":"Short"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":933301,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Christian J.
