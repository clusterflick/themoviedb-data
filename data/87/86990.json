Some returning combat veterans suffer scars that are more psychological than physical. This film follows patients and staff during their treatment. It deals with what would now be called PTSD, but at the time was categorised as psychoneurosis or shell-shock. Government officials deemed this 1946 film counterproductive to postwar efforts; it was not shown publicly until 1981.","popularity":0.6105,"poster_path":"/d97e6fKxt0TvrkUZ5lgrxbZMsZW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39492,"logo_path":null,"name":"U.S. Army Pictorial Services","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1946-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Let There Be Light","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":40,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Que la lumiere soit","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Huston","original_name":"Walter Huston","popularity":0.394,"profile_path":"/yLhqfB99005d2nS7CIkwWO4qzmP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe49ad9251416c910b5229","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6593,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Huston","original_name":"John Huston","popularity":0.6122,"profile_path":"/8AfXZY3D2iekVS5vblhaQx8I1qs.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49ad9251416c910b5225","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6593,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Huston","original_name":"John Huston","popularity":0.6122,"profile_path":"/8AfXZY3D2iekVS5vblhaQx8I1qs.jpg","credit_id":"57e46f8f925141123a009796","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4082,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dimitri Tiomkin","original_name":"Dimitri Tiomkin","popularity":0.2328,"profile_path":"/oYL6Tiuf7MuFEd5F7vf7Dt5vHmF.jpg","credit_id":"57e46fa5c3a36875900093cf","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139317,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Charles Kaufman","original_name":"Charles Kaufman","popularity":0.1107,"profile_path":"/peMifZjC6XlfexJaRqxO1C0Km9i.jpg","credit_id":"5e4bc8649a3c49001632ed4d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51767,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gene Fowler Jr.","original_name":"Gene Fowler Jr.","popularity":0.1166,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4bc8789a3c49001632ed72","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3099,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"William Reynolds","original_name":"William Reynolds","popularity":0.1091,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4bc8892866fa00189c23f8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0038687","wikidata_id":"Q2399580","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dJxxKv6eGBNRGVGlMEuO3J8EoNC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/d97e6fKxt0TvrkUZ5lgrxbZMsZW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wgcAMb5BLKFANzTDfKwnxeH1kYA.jpg","vote_average":2.542,"vote_count":4,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/snOJu9ZBSR1Csbb2E9bu2I7TSlb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":715},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1020,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eHp9ndafd3MvID1QefdMPEQbmnZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":188534,"name":"shell shock"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1946-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"Let There Be Light\" Preview","key":"PSjK9gXKYhI","published_at":"2012-11-07T15:06:35.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"id":"533ec6d3c3a3685448007b6c"}]}}}
