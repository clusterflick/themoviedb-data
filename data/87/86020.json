Last night, fight fans were able to see a rare moment in sports when a sudden 'star' rises from what is categorically termed as goodness, to the cusp of greatness. It was quite a moment in time for avid fight fans and the tense aura in the Madison Square Garden was so thick moments before the fight that you could slice it with a knife. When referee Benjy Estevez Jr. finally dropped his arms as they were parallel to the deck - signaling the start of the fight - it was both the initiation, and culmination of one man's hell of a journey.  From the opening bell there were signs that most who predicted a Mosley victory - (myself included) - would be in for quite a surprise.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mosley vs. Cotto","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
