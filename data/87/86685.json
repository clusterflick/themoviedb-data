They are instructed to go to a remote desert island and pick up an \"item\" and keep it safe for 24 hours. It will then be picked up and they will be paid. However, upon getting it back to their apartment, their curiosity gets the better of them and they decide to investigate their package. They discover that they have a telepathic worm connected to a life support system. The film then disintegrates into a slasher film as one by one the protectors are killed in grisly fashion.","popularity":0.151,"poster_path":"/2IklKezIvHPSZKK2ovCpwJqecf2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Something is dying to get out.","title":"The Item","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1278909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"DawnMarie Ferrara","original_name":"DawnMarie Ferrara","popularity":0.1053,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Lauren","credit_id":"5c719bfe9251415ee6b1233a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":158300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Clark","original_name":"Dan Clark","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Alex","credit_id":"5c719c5bc3a3685a3c138a73","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Pressler","original_name":"David Pressler","popularity":0.1502,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Martin","credit_id":"5c719c73c3a3685a40138094","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2248831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Lake","original_name":"Dan Lake","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Fatty","credit_id":"5c719cc50e0a262c0f7bb4e5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ron Fitzgerald","original_name":"Ron Fitzgerald","popularity":0.055,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Dr. Ody","credit_id":"5c719d03c3a3685a32136882","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2248834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Romy J.
