The dealer is arrested and learns that the murder was witnessed by a couple of anonymous locals. Facing life imprisonment, the dealer decides to hire a hitman to eliminate all the potential witnesses. Outside a rural police station, the hired hitman starts a stopwatch, runs across a road, jumps into his car, and takes off with a screech. He drives full speed through the barren country until he reaches the remote, one street hamlet of Bartoun. He checks his stopwatch. It reads 28 minutes, 36 seconds. He sees a poster advertising a fair in the next village. The residents of Bartoun are advised to meet on main street at noon to get a ride. As the people begin to congregate the next day, the hitman walks toward them and begins shooting. He knows that he has 28 minutes and 36 seconds before the police arrive.","popularity":0.0809,"poster_path":"/i4WZY73guia51Y5TNzaePEemFuI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2003-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One hitman has ten targets to kill in 28 minutes 36 seconds","title":"The Ticking Man","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":933232,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Paul Baker","original_name":"David Paul Baker","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1000,"character":"North","credit_id":"52fe49859251416c910aff47","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122650,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Bryce","original_name":"James Bryce","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1001,"character":"Stewart","credit_id":"52fe49859251416c910aff4b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":933233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margo Croan","original_name":"Margo Croan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1002,"character":"Betty","credit_id":"52fe49859251416c910aff4f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1001852,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Lewis Simpson","original_name":"Steven Lewis Simpson","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49859251416c910aff5b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":933235,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Stephen Lewis Simpson","original_name":"Stephen Lewis Simpson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49859251416c910aff55","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0380753","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nag6XhF7ProunTS2Q1ikQB1NqMs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":635},{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2400,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/i4WZY73guia51Y5TNzaePEemFuI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"THE TICKING MAN TRAILER","key":"vpC72BOtFvE","published_at":"2010-08-12T09:07:29.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6d2c3a3685448007ad9"}]}}}
