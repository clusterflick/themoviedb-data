President George Bush said so… and now that phrase is echoed everywhere. But are we really “addicted”? Our daily lives are dripping in oil. It’s in virtually everything we use and fuels everything we do. To be sure, it is something to worry about. Are we going to run out? Aren’t we fighting wars for oil? But, if we do slow the flow, how will that change the way we live? When it comes to what we’re told about oil, there’s rhetoric and then there’s reality. Who can we believe? The media? Politicians? Environmental activists? You’d be surprised. For nearly ten years, journalist turned media analyst MARK MATHIS has studied our use of oil. And what he found shocked him so thoroughly that he made a movie about the misinformation, distortions and even outright lies about oil. We do have an “oil problem” in America (and the world), but it’s not what you’ve been told. So, it’s time to Fill Up on Truth… for a change.","popularity":0.5586,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"spOILed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":933364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Von","original_name":"Jonathan Von","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1008,"character":"Drug Dealer","credit_id":"52fe498e9251416c910b10c5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":933359,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Mathis","original_name":"Mark Mathis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe498e9251416c910b10a9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":168324,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Davenport","original_name":"Michael Davenport","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe498e9251416c910b10bb","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":933360,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Steve Palmisano","original_name":"Steve Palmisano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe498e9251416c910b10b5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":131669,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kevin Miller","original_name":"Kevin Miller","popularity":0.0664,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe498e9251416c910b10a3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":933356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Mathis","original_name":"Mark Mathis","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe498e9251416c910b1097","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":933358,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Mathis","original_name":"Mark Mathis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe498e9251416c910b109d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":131669,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kevin Miller","original_name":"Kevin Miller","popularity":0.0664,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe498e9251416c910b10af","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":933361,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Steve Palmisano","original_name":"Steve Palmisano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe498e9251416c910b10c1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2105071","wikidata_id":"Q7578823","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10590,"name":"oil"},{"id":10591,"name":"energy"},{"id":11269,"name":"fossil fuel"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"spOILed the movie official trailer spoiledthemovie","key":"7uJInBagFnc","published_at":"2011-06-15T22:37:32.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6d3c3a3685448007b01"}]}}}
