The dramatic real story of a Italian princess, born and raised in the comforts of a golden court, who will be forced by war to share the fate of ordinary people in a concentration camp. Mafalda di Savoia was chosen to represent the decline of nobility and the errors of war, which separate and destroy even noble families. Mafalda is a victim of political strategies that overlook her, and her tragic death shows the levelling power of war, that forces poor and rich alike to share the same destiny.","popularity":0.1884,"poster_path":"/fFVY89pJ4pn9I7dgIxLe44kSxrf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mafalda of Savoy","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"El coraje de una princesa","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":15917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefania Rocca","original_name":"Stefania Rocca","popularity":0.4625,"profile_path":"/dRHhHfeu9OKIEwU84nTeGLZC06h.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mafalda di Savoia","credit_id":"53da4c55c3a3681ed000168a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johannes Brandrup","original_name":"Johannes Brandrup","popularity":0.3216,"profile_path":"/hr97dp4uJ7U6UBKW2wQEivUqPC1.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Filippo d'Assia","credit_id":"52fe498d9251416c910b0ead","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1306949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franco Castellano","original_name":"Franco Castellano","popularity":0.1609,"profile_path":"/gouOPMHPl8we4zBPHkATmTMP0pl.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Aldo Maggio","credit_id":"57f1a85bc3a36868c20039fa","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maurizio Zaccaro","original_name":"Maurizio Zaccaro","popularity":0.1403,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe498d9251416c910b0ea1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0478944","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.741,"height":999,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/fFVY89pJ4pn9I7dgIxLe44kSxrf.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":740},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/qp5BWgcfYPqRZJlk2Hi44vMvtFo.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":2184,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/dRzosqb2Djg4LHxnkV1L45ye2vE.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1527}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
