When Henry divorced her mother and married Anne Boleyn, Mary became an outcast and a threat to the Protestant succession. By a twist of fate, on the death of her brother, she became queen at last in 1553, but her attempts to make England Catholic again were a disaster for her and the country. History has called her \"Bloody Mary\" for the burning of the Protestants, but how fair is this? This film paints another picture, of a woman true to her beliefs, pushed towards a terrible psychological disintegration.","popularity":0.67,"poster_path":"/9vOQXrtRiPFbNISxboGMNZfc88f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United
