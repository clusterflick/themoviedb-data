Trying to understand that she won't be able to see the familiar building from her apartment in New York anymore and afraid of getting on a plane, she sets off for a road trip that is therapy and art performance in one. She has six weeks to get back to New York, and she spends them driving through a country in shock and talking to people she meets along the way. All of them share a strange sadness - not only about the attacks - and a surprising willingness to open their hearts and lives to this young woman with a camera. And by taking us on a trip through her country, she ends up leading us into the very soul of it.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parallel Lines","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":213602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nina Davenport","original_name":"Nina Davenport","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a129251416c910c24d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0408085","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
