To find the location of the mythologic ball, Count Jones needed to travel to Paris, Libano, Jordania, Egypt, the United States and finally Venezuela, in which most of the story happens. Throughout the story, Count Jones had to find his niece, Melissa Jones, who is also his love interest, and travel with her and his nephew Goyito (Honorio Torrealba Jr.), who finally betrays Jones and brings the ball to Er General.","popularity":0.0911,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"El Secreto de la Bola Criolla","title":"Er Conde Jones","video":false,"vote_average":3.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juliet Lima","original_name":"Juliet Lima","popularity":0.1451,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"Melissa Jones","credit_id":"52fe4a269251416c910c4e69","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chile Veloz","original_name":"Chile Veloz","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1004,"character":"Er General","credit_id":"52fe4a269251416c910c4e6d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodolfo Drago","original_name":"Rodolfo Drago","popularity":0.0729,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1005,"character":"Steban","credit_id":"52fe4a269251416c910c4e71","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937687,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bejamín Rausseo","original_name":"Bejamín Rausseo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1006,"character":"Conde Jones","credit_id":"67826cce601acfe7bd4eebb2","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937687,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bejamín Rausseo","original_name":"Bejamín Rausseo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a269251416c910c4e5b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937687,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bejamín Rausseo","original_name":"Bejamín Rausseo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67826cdf8c2309ceafbaf826","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2043842","wikidata_id":"Q5384757","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","release_dates":[{"certification":"A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Er Conde Jones.
