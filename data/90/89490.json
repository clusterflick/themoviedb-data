He comes to the rescue of a homeless orphan, Mili, who suffers from a deep inferiority complex, and permits her to live with his family. Brutally outspoken, he believes that India should be awarded unlimited gold medals for corruption at all levels, fully aware that these beliefs portray him as a 'revolutionary', and prevent him from securing any gainful employment. His life will be turned upside down when he refuses to go along with the plans of the Khan family - consisting of builder, Majid; his goon brother, Farid, and their seemingly benevolent father, Jahangir. His family will also be traumatized after the Police arrest him for the alleged broad-daylight murder of Farid.","popularity":0.4286,"poster_path":"/2t2tpT5Qs1puVcuxVILtASl7h5o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1992-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":161,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Even a spark can set a flame","title":"Angaar","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackie Shroff","original_name":"Jackie Shroff","popularity":0.9925,"profile_path":"/1UNJypgEyuihUW2avLLVYj76jie.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jaikishan 'Jaggu'","credit_id":"52fe4a1c9251416c910c390d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":78921,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dimple Kapadia","original_name":"Dimple Kapadia","popularity":1.4014,"profile_path":"/heNzOM1FsOJO2gtbOopP5NHcInQ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mili","credit_id":"52fe4a1c9251416c910c3911","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nana Patekar","original_name":"Nana Patekar","popularity":0.9631,"profile_path":"/gnhcslE2k2pgZK9xi1XFNZvZiEs.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Majid Khan","credit_id":"52fe4a1c9251416c910c3915","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":174606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kader Khan","original_name":"Kader Khan","popularity":0.9435,"profile_path":"/gf0v2N4xKNGDfHN5lxk7yxUEYQ3.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Jahangir Khan","credit_id":"65c9ca4d680be8017ea62fc8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Om Puri","original_name":"Om Puri","popularity":0.4953,"profile_path":"/npVcDkdHSROXbMPUr45MGBJFQus.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Parvez Hussain","credit_id":"65c9ca748d77c4017b47ce85","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4531981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kiran Kumar","original_name":"Kiran Kumar","popularity":0.0799,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Anwar Khan","credit_id":"65c9ca818d77c4016246b0b9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":629478,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Achyut Potdar","original_name":"Achyut Potdar","popularity":0.4243,"profile_path":"/qXry6GpV7xlEDyyJgHXxmFgnJ8G.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Jaggu's Father","credit_id":"65c9caa3ce6c4c0149b9d311","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4531986,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sulbha Deshpande","original_name":"Sulbha Deshpande","popularity":0.0498,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Jaggu's Mother","credit_id":"65c9cac93c3ab00148ce9c24","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":583509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neena Gupta","original_name":"Neena Gupta","popularity":0.4628,"profile_path":"/znCPPYR79c1DU2MvA61JXhdMeCs.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Majid's Wife","credit_id":"65c9cae0b6cff10185a8028b","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":230027,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sujit Sen","original_name":"Sujit Sen","popularity":0.0668,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a1c9251416c910c3927","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937279,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sashilaal Nair","original_name":"Sashilaal Nair","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a1c9251416c910c391b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":174606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kader Khan","original_name":"Kader Khan","popularity":0.9435,"profile_path":"/gf0v2N4xKNGDfHN5lxk7yxUEYQ3.jpg","credit_id":"56c879e2c3a3684089002fd8","department":"Writing","job":"Dialogue"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8311,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Farah Khan","original_name":"Farah Khan","popularity":0.7278,"profile_path":"/yfmm3VIGRZ8RDRQ0pjn3Vizw6WC.jpg","credit_id":"578286b7c3a3685d4c00065a","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0103689","wikidata_id":"Q4761899","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1139,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2t2tpT5Qs1puVcuxVILtASl7h5o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":760}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
