It is a great story of young people's blindness to the rise of Fascism, the destruction of bourgeois values, a first love and shattered friendships.","popularity":0.3547,"poster_path":"/cFZsaNmTLFG7kRsbLUlqvl9F9ka.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7241,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film-Line Productions GmbH","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":13406,"logo_path":null,"name":"Total TV","origin_country":""},{"id":1655,"logo_path":null,"name":"Új Budapest Filmstudió","origin_country":"HU"},{"id":1833,"logo_path":"/6Ot5X5xRv0PvZ9cUUD5ZymSruLi.png","name":"Epo-Film","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2007-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Beheaded Rooster","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","title":"Cocoșul decapitat","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Stritzel","original_name":"Oliver Stritzel","popularity":0.2687,"profile_path":"/b1ZhxkiyCnw6Iz2GHnImSsfjTdY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Eugen Goldschmidt","credit_id":"54386c3f0e0a264a45002ad3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23172,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florian Brückner","original_name":"Florian Brückner","popularity":0.1413,"profile_path":"/7Tt2vfWj5o0n1kP9jCa7bR5Vj8o.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Engelbert Goldschmidt","credit_id":"54386c4ec3a3686ecc0033c4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1193800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Zimmerschied","original_name":"David Zimmerschied","popularity":0.1734,"profile_path":"/zvNZBqjhsO5GtSI03qiM88FCTJO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Felix Goldschmidt","credit_id":"55af915b9251411e1100c7cc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alicja Bachleda-Curuś","original_name":"Alicja Bachleda-Curuś","popularity":0.6458,"profile_path":"/ojL25lx4zeHccDDdM6r78L5Vnxw.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Gisela Glückselig","credit_id":"58a0d589c3a3684dc0002c78","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":28433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marion Mitterhammer","original_name":"Marion Mitterhammer","popularity":0.3744,"profile_path":"/nMbErxHWaATth1jyfPvAaDcIGDg.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Hermine","credit_id":"58a0d5bfc3a3684db9002ca8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefan Murr","original_name":"Stefan Murr","popularity":0.2073,"profile_path":"/lO6SUVaKDZ7GckU55vIoDk0o3Sp.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Csontos","credit_id":"5a7506a2c3a36859fc02c5dc","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Werner Prinz","original_name":"Werner Prinz","popularity":0.1406,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Grossvater Goldschmidt","credit_id":"5ae5ccf0c3a368092d002acd","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":149124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ioana Iacob","original_name":"Ioana Iacob","popularity":0.2012,"profile_path":"/iI8lwVmyNtGaRrirwMSPic0mgm.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Alfa Sigrid Binder","credit_id":"5e036f3bd236e6001696287e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Axel Moustache","original_name":"Axel Moustache","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":"/fOzZ8qgJ7hKk90XBY97I7ezmdZE.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Hans Adolf Bediner","credit_id":"5e036ff9d1a8930019919db5","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1056166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margitai Ági","original_name":"Margitai Ági","popularity":0.0551,"profile_path":"/lozBRKW8knQZiznDGB9KAU4ZFJn.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Grandmother Goldschmidt","credit_id":"5e037011d236e6001296571f","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1155733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victoria Cociaș","original_name":"Victoria Cociaș","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/gWeen5YWcBsmgfqdkCGVq2Yqzch.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Mrs. Goldschmidt","credit_id":"5e03702675110d0011dd0487","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1530014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monica Ghiuță","original_name":"Monica Ghiuță","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/3IvwBBb60qFjFHm33vK5A7yRQa7.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Countess Filality","credit_id":"5e03703f75110d0018dd6bf9","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1638685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ovidiu Schumacher","original_name":"Ovidiu Schumacher","popularity":0.1136,"profile_path":"/4xTiDQNPXHavl69IrXe6w4zWGtW.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Rev.
