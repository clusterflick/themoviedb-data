First is \"The House That Jack Built\" as told with a variety of characters composed of letters that spell out their names (Example: the cow is made up of an intertwined C, O, and W). Next is \"Old MacDonald Had a Band\" (no, not farm) in which Old MacDonald and his band give way with a hot jazz number (even his animals play instruments). The piece comes to an end when Old MacDonald's wife is tired of doing all the housework and gives him a swift whack on his head with her rolling pin.","popularity":0.5775,"poster_path":"/2R0mOIskd6xHmZ8cUOJ9s1WQMph.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1956-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jack and Old Mac","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":148811,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Jack Parr","original_name":"Jack Parr","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a2a9251416c910c56ff","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":150118,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Eyvind Earle","original_name":"Eyvind Earle","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a2a9251416c910c56f9","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Color Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148808,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Xavier Atencio","original_name":"Xavier Atencio","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a2a9251416c910c56e7","department":"Writing","job":"Characters"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":148176,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Bob Carlson","original_name":"Bob Carlson","popularity":0.0708,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a2a9251416c910c56ed","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57337,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"George Bruns","original_name":"George Bruns","popularity":0.0586,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a2a9251416c910c56e1","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115757,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dick Kinney","original_name":"Dick Kinney","popularity":0.1633,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a2a9251416c910c56cf","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148242,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Al Coe","original_name":"Al Coe","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a2a9251416c910c56f3","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":148174,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Bill Justice","original_name":"Bill Justice","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a2a9251416c910c56c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4a2a9251416c910c56db","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":148807,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Roy Williams","original_name":"Roy Williams","popularity":0.1505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5541048dc3a36829e50019a5","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0049376","wikidata_id":"Q3157351","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":801,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qeYpCandlktvUCptWWj4QKYxzGv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1424}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rFIBJy1lzrJhsm7jK9AYbcMSMyO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2R0mOIskd6xHmZ8cUOJ9s1WQMph.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":155467,"name":"nursery rhyme"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1956-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
