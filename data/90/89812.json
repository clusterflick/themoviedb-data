The storyline should be of interest to pro-ecologists, inasmuch as the directors take to task the warmongers of the world for despoiling the natural beauties of the European mountain ranges with their shell-fire.  The final outrage occurs during a battle between the Austrians and the Italians in the Dolomites, culminating with the destruction of an entire mountain (hence the film's title).  The harrowing images on screen were complemented perfectly by the musical score of Giuseppe Beece.  Also known as The Doomed Batallion, Berge in Flammen was filmed in three different languages -- German, English, French -- for a total cost of $150,000.","popularity":0.269,"poster_path":"/bWz98phOygjDLXj5W7NyTRm6YFF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19072,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Marcel Vandal et Charles
