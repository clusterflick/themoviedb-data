Guillermo, a self-destructive policeman tormented by his latent homosexuality, blackmails Daniel into committing a murder behind bars. In exchange, Daniel gains his freedom and returns to the only thing he knows how to do: box. But this time the search for pain to relieve the guilt has made his conservative style more aggressive. He remembers the last conversation he had with the man he killed, when he talked about his wife, and goes to meet her. Seeing danger in the relationship between the victim's murderer and his widow, Guillermo tries to stop it.","popularity":0.3881,"poster_path":"/oulYJZamvHL3SyiEwwkoSOSzdAh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18446,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ábaco Movies S.L.","origin_country":""},{"id":18447,"logo_path":null,"name":"Madridsur Producciones","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2006-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When love and hatred hit, it is difficult to maintain...","title":"La distancia","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":14,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"La distancia","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Auf Distanz - Töten um zu leben","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Auf Distanz","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miguel Ángel Silvestre","original_name":"Miguel Ángel Silvestre","popularity":1.0007,"profile_path":"/d4sSRjM0loG0xx6836zXcZq2MJ5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Daniel","credit_id":"52fe4a229251416c910c453f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jose Coronado","original_name":"Jose Coronado","popularity":0.9278,"profile_path":"/9xo68HzH8n78Xv6gMzKK7XnjtHd.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Guillermo","credit_id":"52fe4a229251416c910c4543","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Federico Luppi","original_name":"Federico Luppi","popularity":0.1491,"profile_path":"/jBzJ3t4kRssFbEuZxSnHxACe6oC.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Entrenador","credit_id":"52fe4a229251416c910c4547","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":96686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Belén López","original_name":"Belén López","popularity":0.6824,"profile_path":"/rl22Ll44NIitP1nUtORp90OUvGI.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Raquel","credit_id":"52fe4a229251416c910c454b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1181029,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Iñaki Dorronsoro","original_name":"Iñaki Dorronsoro","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a229251416c910c4557","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1275255,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Isidro F.
