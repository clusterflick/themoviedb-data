Brazen forgeries and impersonations branded the white collar crime spree remarkable. \"Unraveled\" is set in the purgatory of house arrest -- an Upper East Side penthouse -- where the Court has ordered Dreier confined until his sentencing day. The film weaves Dreier's struggle to prepare for the possibility of life imprisonment with first-person flashbacks, which reveal his audacious path of destruction. Destroyed by his own hubris, Dreier attempts to grasp his tragic unraveling. With unprecedented access, \"Unraveled\" exposes a mastermind of criminal deception.","popularity":0.5127,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":14406,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ambush Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":4100,"logo_path":"/rdejHBPjtBviLxJbcc2oSCBb1E0.png","name":"Stick Figure Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An Ambitious Man, An Immoral Plan.","title":"Unraveled","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Dreier","original_name":"Marc Dreier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4a309251416c910c6289","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937914,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Chris Hajia","original_name":"Chris Hajia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a309251416c910c6255","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937916,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alyse Ardell Spiegel","original_name":"Alyse Ardell Spiegel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a309251416c910c6267","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937918,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel Laikind","original_name":"Daniel Laikind","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a309251416c910c6279","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christina Burchard","original_name":"Christina Burchard","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a309251416c910c6261","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Cantor","original_name":"Steven Cantor","popularity":0.1861,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a309251416c910c6273","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90702,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matthew Makar","original_name":"Matthew Makar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a309251416c910c627f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90698,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marc H.
