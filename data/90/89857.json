After his band breaks up, Fitz finds himself dealing drugs out of his garage and bonding with 16-year-old neighborhood kid Jimmy (Dylan O’Brien). As his former band mates (Zach Woods, Matt L. Jones, Lizzy Caplan) begin finding success and one of his drug deals goes awry, Fitz hits the road with Jimmy. Amid car chases, guns, broken bones, sassy cabbies and a suspicious doctor (Horatio Sanz), Fitz has to navigate their way to safe harbor--and he doesn’t even know about the surprise Monica has in store for him back home!","popularity":2.7984,"poster_path":"/qQRZwequtuXOcYVHvdyAD5A5L2X.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8714,"logo_path":"/cLH8bzJW3voNXF8uYKPKr50sdWp.png","name":"Northern Lights
