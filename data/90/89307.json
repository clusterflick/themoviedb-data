The editor also has \"dirt\" files on an Army General, his banker and other \"clients\". All of them make little-concealed verbal threats to him at a party but the person that hated him most is a female reporter who the editor had just fired from the paper for attempting to write a serious story. She threatens him and soon after the editor is found, floating in his pool, shot. The reporter is arrested for the crime and Perry, who has a personal stake in this matter, with the aid of Della and Paul set out to solve the mystery. But the other suspects just want the case over with and will go to any lengths to protect their pasts and their secrets","popularity":2.7206,"poster_path":"/fY3JIoOQqkiwUqC3yBeAMgW9yQZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56690,"logo_path":"/5cEgzWHzPriA6ZSNaZWkqJqi2UU.png","name":"Fred Silverman Company","origin_country":"US"},{"id":106634,"logo_path":"/3je2R9JZv4STKHX5igutY3hnVl2.png","name":"Strathmore Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":12077,"logo_path":"/s6p5INYKlo6gD6RFXlm9ACA2VVj.png","name":"Viacom Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":56684,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fred Silverman Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Perry Mason: The Case of the Scandalous Scoundrel","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Перри Мейсон: Дело скандального хроникера","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Тайны бульварной прессы","type":"Alternative Hallmark Title"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Дело скандального хроникера","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Burr","original_name":"Raymond Burr","popularity":0.8732,"profile_path":"/gsmckogOXPIk6lce2qnNMAFF901.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Perry Mason","credit_id":"52fe4a149251416c910c277d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":109701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Hale","original_name":"Barbara Hale","popularity":1.1286,"profile_path":"/xLE53ZfGifU5hNyjoE6z6FsOU01.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Della Street","credit_id":"52fe4a149251416c910c2781","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Katt","original_name":"William Katt","popularity":0.9573,"profile_path":"/gfNMkpm33MsN2Q07JWIHI4UFas3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Paul Drake Jr.","credit_id":"52fe4a149251416c910c2785","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Guillaume","original_name":"Robert Guillaume","popularity":0.5902,"profile_path":"/prqxpeFeyyarRxxfaMHrqCKVyhV.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Harlan Wade","credit_id":"5e2f1db1c56d2d00154e500d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":79739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morgan Brittany","original_name":"Morgan Brittany","popularity":0.6687,"profile_path":"/7Q2qz5FTqgIyCwbWWVRdnLBUHEA.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Marianne Clayman","credit_id":"5e2f1dd2326c1900181bc4c5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugene Butler","original_name":"Eugene Butler","popularity":0.1349,"profile_path":"/983Tesq5toXBXgmVm0iPtHRxa8h.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Nick Moretti","credit_id":"5e2f1de61685da0017ea2fd2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"René Enríquez","original_name":"René Enríquez","popularity":0.1705,"profile_path":"/nZqwDRgZYvoMSZWOw3ETF1No8oV.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Oscar Ortega","credit_id":"5e2f1dfbc56d2d00154e5058","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Grizzard","original_name":"George Grizzard","popularity":0.6113,"profile_path":"/nGhVTWuoYbYfTnzZqxrWY9F0p6p.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Dr. Clayman","credit_id":"5e2f1e101685da0013e9eb9a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wings Hauser","original_name":"Wings Hauser","popularity":0.7829,"profile_path":"/yYGJCFjsWNVVOPqq2Rl1JWRrYt3.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Capt.
