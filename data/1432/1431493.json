As he struts through the theatre, he encounters Bella, the overwhelmed stage manager, and Tommy, a young actor balancing theatre with school assignments. Grant's narcissistic attitude and inflated sense of self-worth create friction with the cast and crew, including a bickering couple, Laura and Kyle, and the absent young star, Steve.  Grant's self-centered monologues and dismissive behaviour toward others highlight his struggle to accept his diminished career. He dismisses Bella's attempts to manage the production, derides Tommy's dedication, and belittles Steve's budding success in film.","popularity":0.0759,"poster_path":"/5G0csGVlaN01iL7HuM5h8HdrfxO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":252938,"logo_path":null,"name":"Winter
