Battling the cold and unpredictable waters of the English Channel, Gerrard faces not only the rough conditions but also the need to swim in synchronization with his team of guide swimmers, Hayden, Phil, Jo, Rosie, Alexis, and Sarah by his side. Fewer than 3000 individuals have triumphed over the grueling 34km swim from England to France since the first successful attempt in 1875. Remarkably, more people have scaled Mount Everest than swum across the English Channel. Gerrard Gosens, having attempted climbed Mt. Everest, has now set his sights on conquering another extraordinary feat - the English Channel swim. His remarkable journey is driven by a profound motivation to inspire others to pursue their own dreams as Gerrard got closer to France than any totally blind (from birth) person in history.","popularity":0.2112,"poster_path":"/tb4pqkKpxBI5Anjc6FXf7qD2yk3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Changing Channels","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33355273","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tb4pqkKpxBI5Anjc6FXf7qD2yk3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
