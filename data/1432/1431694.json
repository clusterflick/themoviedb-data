Starting with the biological approach, where love is understood as a result of a chemical reaction, through the love that parents give to their children, siblings to each other, to the sympathy of two people - first infatuation, and with time a mature and stable bond. The picture does not idealize love, however. It also touches on the problems of betrayal and loneliness in the modern world.","popularity":0.0368,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"8 films about Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"8 filmów o miłości","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5236202,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sylwia Sendyk","original_name":"Sylwia Sendyk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a8ab43df55e8f213f13040","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1617473,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Teresa Czepiec","original_name":"Teresa Czepiec","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a8ab5cdf55e8f213f13052","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5083639,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Urszula Laskowska","original_name":"Urszula Laskowska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a8ab732287f3b917c8c44b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1715783,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Zamecka","original_name":"Anna Zamecka","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a8ab88b9360c3e33e091ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3047676,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olga Korotkaya","original_name":"Olga Korotkaya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a8ab9904053203b6e05204","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2265451,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ewa Podgórska","original_name":"Ewa Podgórska","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a8abac31001bec13c8e258","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5236226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olga Apanosowicz-Katlubej","original_name":"Olga Apanosowicz-Katlubej","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a8abd2b9360c3e33e091f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1766072,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Agnieszka Elbanowska","original_name":"Agnieszka Elbanowska","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a8abe22287f3b917c8c48e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
