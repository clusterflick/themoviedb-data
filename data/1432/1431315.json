The consequences are steep and along the way, viewers learn about Blood Alcohol Level (also known as BAC or Blood Alcohol Content), techniques police use to verify a driver’s inebriation such as the breathalyzer, and the reasons why driving drunk is so dangerous. This film was produced by legendary social guidance filmmaker Sid Davis in cooperation with the Monterey Park Police Department.","popularity":0.4058,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":18853,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sid Davis Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1973-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alcohol and Red Flares","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086191,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sid Davis","original_name":"Sid Davis","popularity":0.0962,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a7bb0bbf0a9f6f54e0804e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":567,"name":"alcohol"},{"id":155232,"name":"drunk driving"},{"id":199934,"name":"social guidance"},{"id":223921,"name":"dui"},{"id":223922,"name":"driving under the influence"},{"id":241542,"name":"public safety"},{"id":345959,"name":"drivers education"},{"id":345984,"name":"drivers safety"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Date is estimated","release_date":"1973-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"“ALCOHOL AND RED FLARES”  1970s DRIVER’S EDUCATION FILM   DRINKING AND DRIVING XD47864","key":"4rs87Zx2PGM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-05-28T16:29:56.000Z","id":"67a7bab531001bec13c8c50c"}]}}}
