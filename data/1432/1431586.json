The film follows Rani and her brother Tom, who share a close bond. After returning to the UK from a Nepal holiday, Rani notices something deeply concerning about Tom: his skin and eyes have a yellowish tint, and he looks frail and exhausted. He's lost a staggering 15 kilograms in just a month and seems weaker by the day. Rani, alarmed and worried, insists on taking him to the Aldershot Health Centre to see a GP. The GP, recognizing the urgency of Tom's condition, immediately refers him to Frimley Park Hospital for further testing and treatment. Tom is admitted to the hospital for three weeks, where doctors diagnose him with a range of serious health conditions: jaundice, autoimmune hepatitis, gallstones, and an ulcer. The medical team informs Tom and Rani that his health is in a critical state, and his future is uncertain.","popularity":0.0916,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frimley Park Hospital","video":true,"vote_average":9.75,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1326945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kumud Pant","original_name":"Kumud Pant","popularity":0.2629,"profile_path":"/6qYgWw2lI6SnzpMk6Nt7loaH7yy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Tom","credit_id":"67a88144df55e8f213f12b2d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5204344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bidhyabati Pant","original_name":"Bidhyabati Pant","popularity":0.1496,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Tom's mother","credit_id":"67a8815bbf0a9f6f54e094ca","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5203361,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janaki Pant","original_name":"Janaki Pant","popularity":0.0991,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Rani","credit_id":"67a8817108dff90318f109e8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5203357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Puspa Pant","original_name":"Puspa Pant","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Priyanka","credit_id":"67a88186df55e8f213f12b56","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1358599,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bharat Mistri","original_name":"Bharat Mistri","popularity":0.1829,"profile_path":"/iTVM44yQaYXdKaluQ0CKjJKpBCi.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Dr. Gary","credit_id":"67a881a8bf0a9f6f54e094ef","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4241224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dimple Kumar","original_name":"Dimple Kumar","popularity":0.1715,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Tom's Friend","credit_id":"67a881da89f05e1619f13781","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1326945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kumud Pant","original_name":"Kumud Pant","popularity":0.2629,"profile_path":"/6qYgWw2lI6SnzpMk6Nt7loaH7yy.jpg","credit_id":"67a880f208dff90318f109c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1326945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kumud Pant","original_name":"Kumud Pant","popularity":0.2629,"profile_path":"/6qYgWw2lI6SnzpMk6Nt7loaH7yy.jpg","credit_id":"67a88100f5aaa6afa9e0873c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1326945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kumud Pant","original_name":"Kumud Pant","popularity":0.2629,"profile_path":"/6qYgWw2lI6SnzpMk6Nt7loaH7yy.jpg","credit_id":"67a8810e06bd0cefa6e05ee0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28608441","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-12-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
