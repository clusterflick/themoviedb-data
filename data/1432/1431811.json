Jean de Segni receives word from his lawyers that his profligate ways, including keeping mercenary actress Dorothea Jardeau, have led to his ruin which he accepts with a shrug of the shoulders. As word spreads Jean’s father-the Duke, who has managed to keep the boy’s mother in the dark about her son’s true nature, realizes she will soon know. Terminally ill and fearing Jean reducing them to penury, the father decides to take his beloved wife with him and kills her. Jean is at first suspected but the Duke saves him by confessing his guilt. Nevertheless, everyone, including his Dorothea, believes the Duke lied to save his son, and after his father's death Jean finds himself a social outcast. An argument leads to a duel where Jean realizes his folly has killed his parents, and he fires in the air, receiving a mortal wound from his adversary.","popularity":0.4609,"poster_path":"/mC0Lf8fem7xfGyXjJ76C8bPTjrN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Price for Folly","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1187868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edith Storey","original_name":"Edith Storey","popularity":0.1884,"profile_path":"/r8iO5KZFDf3V7o13KWlB67iuWZK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dorothea Jardeau","credit_id":"67a8eb4bad2758bac5f1399f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Moreno","original_name":"Antonio Moreno","popularity":0.3889,"profile_path":"/swsEgnc8bkILLcOjUDPGtZdXnQs.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"M.
