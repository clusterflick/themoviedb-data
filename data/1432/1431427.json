They meet Sira and FC, two independent female journalists who denounce the corruption put in place by this organization. This quartet, despite differences and tensions in the way they each carry out their profession, will attack these criminals in order to bring down the thinking heads of this mafia network. Will they manage to come together to resolve this investigation and put an end to the corruption that is plaguing the country?
