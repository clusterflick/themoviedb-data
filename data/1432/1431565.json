Opening their doors, they saw the deadliest train wreck in state history. The worst wreck in American history since 1918... This was the Broker, which came off the rails taking the lives of 85 people and injuring hundreds more, scarring many for life, both physically and emotionally... it was officially deemed as a simple case of excessive speed, but frustrated investigations failed to get to the bottom of things, leaving many questions unanswered. We're using the advanced technology of Unreal Engine 5 to piece this wreckage back together, bringing the history to life like never before. Guided by historians, exploring the wrecksite, and hearing the stories directly from survivors, we're re-examining this 73 year old case, and hopefully answering these questions once and for all.","popularity":0.0687,"poster_path":"/atu93XYwncT8y1zyEeYzA4i7YmE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wreck of the Broker: The Woodbridge Train Disaster of 1951","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5235599,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Lynskey","original_name":"Tom Lynskey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a8777d2287f3b917c8bbde","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3511938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miriam Writer","original_name":"Miriam Writer","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a877aa58d93cefedc8d635","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5235602,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gordon Bond","original_name":"Gordon Bond","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a877bbad2758bac5f131fe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5235603,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Steven Schwankert","original_name":"Steven Schwankert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a877d25fa42d7e76f12de3","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5235606,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Alex Moeller","original_name":"Alex Moeller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a877fba32057b6fdc8d05d","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5235608,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Steve Lerro","original_name":"Steve Lerro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a87819ad2758bac5f1320a","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Modeling"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5235609,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Alex Moeller","original_name":"Alex Moeller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a8782258d93cefedc8d657","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Modeling"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5235614,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"John Turkeli","original_name":"John Turkeli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a8785458d93cefedc8d689","department":"Crew","job":"Technical Advisor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gjEnRgfQ6W74mPLlAM3Ff5wHKnu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4tEus3MXNxGsojaJdf41hvMEHcO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/atu93XYwncT8y1zyEeYzA4i7YmE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
