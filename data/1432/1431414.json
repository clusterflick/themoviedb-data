Dated 27th August 1930.  Filmed by John P. Ritchie, amateur cine enthusiast and ornithologist, during egg-collecting expedition to St. Kilda. This is unique footage of the preparations for evacuation, the existence of which was kept secret until 1979. At the time of the evacuation, Scottish Office regulations prohibited any photos or newsreel recordings of the event.  The motor boat seen towing rowing boat and being hoisted on board \"Dunara Castle\" was collected at Tarbert, Harris, on the outward voyage, to assist with the evacuation, there being no motorised boat on St. Kilda. N.B. The married women on St. Kilda all wore shawls. The film includes shots of Rachel MacDonald, whose child died for lack of medical attention, and thus contributed to the decision to evacuate St. Kilda.","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Evacuation Of St Kilda","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
