A few years later, her mother becomes involved with a man who bears an uncanny resemblance to the deceased. He's not a ghost, just a bad look-alike, and Jeanne's mother has decided to have him re-enact their story, according to her own rules. But even if it means bringing back the dead, Jeanne feels she has something to say, especially what she couldn't say when her father was alive.","popularity":0.0998,"poster_path":"/bJbnZIaaKRLtE1Nj6vRdiqmn2Ov.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Merci pour le souvenir","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":239639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Citti","original_name":"Marc Citti","popularity":0.1378,"profile_path":"/2JBiL4zPNzv0b2DxqZcE4B3UaYU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67a75a701729ffa1cae06826","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":130890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathalie Boutefeu","original_name":"Nathalie Boutefeu","popularity":0.1476,"profile_path":"/lQDyQlP1mGLMegluZtBa0J218h6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67a75a7b269f0bc4f5f11ae5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":141635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pauline Étienne","original_name":"Pauline Étienne","popularity":0.4019,"profile_path":"/oR65XubUv0Wn4hhLJqImPIXrHrC.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67a75a85b9360c3e33e06e3e","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":110596,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mathias Gokalp","original_name":"Mathias Gokalp","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/OJjlM1N42yyMLdaa5LA7yBiasa.jpg","credit_id":"67a75a9a31001bec13c8b34b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":110596,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mathias Gokalp","original_name":"Mathias Gokalp","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/OJjlM1N42yyMLdaa5LA7yBiasa.jpg","credit_id":"67a75ab1571d707f14c8b18a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3476642,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Christophe Orcand","original_name":"Christophe Orcand","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a75aeb58d93cefedc8b11a","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1965742,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Corvo Lepesant-Lamari","original_name":"Corvo Lepesant-Lamari","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a75b00571d707f14c8b1a3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":923,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bJbnZIaaKRLtE1Nj6vRdiqmn2Ov.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":615}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Clermont Film Festival 2025","release_date":"2025-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
