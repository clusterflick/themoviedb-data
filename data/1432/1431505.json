Elizabeth meets Darcy at the Meryton Assembly, but a chaotic stampede of dinosaurs interrupts their conversation. The dinosaurs' arrival is the result of the sorcerer Mr. Wickhamâ€™s vengeful plot to gain power through dark magic. He sends Elizabeth a letter blaming Darcy. Meanwhile, Mr. Collins, a dinosaur, proposes to Elizabeth, but she rejects him. Lady Catherine de Bourgh, a T-Rex under magical influence, confronts Elizabeth. Darcy arrives to save her. Wickham plans to send Lydia back in time through a magical portal. As the volcano erupts, Wickham and Lydia are sent to the past, and Mr. Collins follows. With danger averted, Elizabeth and Darcy confess their love. The movie ends at Pemberley Estate, now a sanctuary for redeemed dinosaurs, singing a joyful musical number.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/ApBhYwCWtZIF4YW7JPuTXO34PT0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12164,"logo_path":"/7MieiLl5TiCDr6cY96OZdStaaEK.png","name":"Feature Films for Families","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pride and Prejudice Dino Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y9AxS9ORBxGCPO5uoy0FZtmrMVv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ApBhYwCWtZIF4YW7JPuTXO34PT0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1998-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Pride and Prejudice: Dino Time!
