Meanwhile, Paul, a handsome and strong man living in London, dreams of finding the perfect woman to marry. Their paths cross at Tower Bridge, where Paul is instantly captivated by Aanchal's beauty. Mesmerized, he begins to follow her through the city-Tower Bridge to Waterloo Station, and finally to London Bridge-imagining a future together filled with love and happiness. But when Paul turns to approach her, Aanchal suddenly disappears. Reality strikes, and Paul learns she is already married, her sadness hidden behind her beauty.
