Rarely performed in its original version – the score was reworked by Rameau himself in 1754 –, this daring work plays on contrasts and expressiveness, as in the famous “Tristes apprêts”. The aria is sung by Télaïre mourning the death of her fiancé Castor, killed in battle, before his twin brother Pollux descends into the Underworld to ask his father, Jupiter, to bring him back to life.  While this opera celebrates brotherly love, its prologue poses an essential question for director Peter Sellars: how do you stop a war and its attendant hatred and resentment?","popularity":0.4213,"poster_path":"/gGTiMot6xZzfhAzCeKY8YS6DDF5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":200,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Opéra National de Paris: Castor et Pollux by Jean-Philippe Rameau","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3486514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanine De Bique","original_name":"Jeanine De Bique","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/tvJ9h7vFeZpP3eoOtt3xn3yXz56.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Télaïre","credit_id":"67a8dfcede283c900ec8d5bd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1691831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reinoud van Mechelen","original_name":"Reinoud van Mechelen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/nSnauQGsIghu5mP4anBBNPVM9e8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Castor","credit_id":"67a8dfffbf0a9f6f54e09dd8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2265593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Mauillon","original_name":"Marc Mauillon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/b9QkzprNAy1iMTgaCS0flDHzoYH.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Pollux","credit_id":"67a8e06f08dff90318f11808","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1562702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stéphanie d'Oustrac","original_name":"Stéphanie d'Oustrac","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/9guMcqwiT3mIl0lGWqL8pDugjJ0.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Phébé","credit_id":"67a8e09dde283c900ec8d68a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5236631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Antoine","original_name":"Claire Antoine","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/ac7S2lQeQDd5mSmqNm6VwmJMP76.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Minerve, Une Suivante d’Hébé","credit_id":"67a8e109df55e8f213f137f3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4864126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurence Kilsby","original_name":"Laurence Kilsby","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/x6Soytdd0LQfcM1Mw4508hf4T84.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"L’Amour, Le Grand-Prêtre, un Athlète","credit_id":"67a8e12f31001bec13c8e774","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5236636,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalia Smirnova","original_name":"Natalia Smirnova","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/7XGWCuPNWgCofcXpnyKEmVhq4pk.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Vénus, une ombre heureuse","credit_id":"67a8e16106bd0cefa6e071ce","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5236661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicholas Newton","original_name":"Nicholas Newton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/2jolAvquECxiYXN8uRIiiYd3OwQ.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mars, Jupiter, un athlète","credit_id":"67a8e3d606bd0cefa6e07293","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1654586,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Teodor Currentzis","original_name":"Teodor Currentzis","popularity":0.3114,"profile_path":"/tUfr78hs4jdKmaM0m6zrTyJKT2O.jpg","cast_id":25,"character":"Self – Conductor","credit_id":"67d2e39de188eaa47c1dddbc","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3820553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Utopia","original_name":"Utopia","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/7nmU1L54XOeCDIO8Npz0qfGHigx.jpg","cast_id":26,"character":"Orchestra and Choir","credit_id":"67d2e3c876a9d73467813256","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143279,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Sellars","original_name":"Peter Sellars","popularity":0.0973,"profile_path":"/jnpWmiRJ8AvGlVq87liEiuQbgvo.jpg","credit_id":"67a8e7cb08dff90318f119a2","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5236671,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vitaly Polonsky","original_name":"Vitaly Polonsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a8e866f5aaa6afa9e0966f","department":"Sound","job":"Music Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1654586,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Teodor Currentzis","original_name":"Teodor Currentzis","popularity":0.3114,"profile_path":"/tUfr78hs4jdKmaM0m6zrTyJKT2O.jpg","credit_id":"67a8e886b9360c3e33e09c01","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5236672,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Cal Hunt","original_name":"Cal Hunt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a8e8fd2287f3b917c8cfcd","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1439711,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Camille Assaf","original_name":"Camille Assaf","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a8e920b9360c3e33e09c6a","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costumer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1422904,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"James F.
