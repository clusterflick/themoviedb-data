Never before has a French politician generated so much contradictory comments, both during his lifetime and after his death. Beyond his political career, his complex and mysterious personality continues to fascinate. To lift a corner of the veil, Jean-Christophe and Gilbert Mitterrand and Mazarine Pingeot agreed to share some private memories of their father. By leafing through François Mitterrand's photographic albums, it is possible to reconstruct his personal journey, from his childhood years through to his life with Anne Pingeot and his daughter Mazarine.","popularity":0.2128,"poster_path":"/hi23ZPkPoAOmlLrmFOFMF1sSZuJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98177,"logo_path":"/6JFTX9NKUsBmUulNssubQVYI2NX.png","name":"Yami 2","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"François Mitterrand: Family Albums","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1742804,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mazarine Pingeot","original_name":"Mazarine Pingeot","popularity":0.1584,"profile_path":"/riBL4oCSHzflJlrYbcRhqLoJ6TB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mazarine Pingeot","credit_id":"651147b4344a8e096f85879d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3068004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gilbert Mitterrand","original_name":"Gilbert Mitterrand","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/8dYUdZ8Ei6CGibihy02xr1lzM8Z.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Gilbert Mitterrand","credit_id":"65114808e1faed00ae30dfed","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1379020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Christophe Mitterrand","original_name":"Jean-Christophe Mitterrand","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/3lP0NwCrdKfOQ9LNR37d7RM1Zke.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jean-Christophe Mitterrand","credit_id":"65114830344a8e096d9f0495","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Didier Bezace","original_name":"Didier Bezace","popularity":0.14,"profile_path":"/hH15W5VeRFWz80vIXKdmfcuEA5o.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Voix","credit_id":"651148c6e1faed00e3f6d082","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1615723,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pierre Favier","original_name":"Pierre Favier","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65114890e1faed00ae30e060","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1972812,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugues Nancy","original_name":"Hugues Nancy","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6511486ae8d0b400eb304dc3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2053045,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fabien Beziat","original_name":"Fabien Beziat","popularity":0.0534,"profile_path":"/z3qNc1iuYVTl1qzCh4xt8WnD1ao.jpg","credit_id":"65114882a9117f013853a67c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2550,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hi23ZPkPoAOmlLrmFOFMF1sSZuJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1700},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/um1qt46RmpQvvNJ85DJDRrBU4GM.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":810}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
