He caught meningitis. He was 18 years old. It was a shock to all who knew and loved him and now, nearly 25 years later, he's very much remembered and loved.  We think of him every day, we remember his jokes, we remember his hopes. Sometimes it's hard to cope with him not being there. We imagine him seeing all the things we've been doing. This is a film by one of us: Eddie's dad, Michael.","popularity":0.1108,"poster_path":"/9LbMfMZGxOwqv3GKcBxPCaFbVAI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":209534,"logo_path":null,"name":"Apples and Snakes","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Death of Eddie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Michael Rosen - The Death of Eddie","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1727350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Rosen","original_name":"Michael Rosen","popularity":0.0971,"profile_path":"/1IMA8m3NUQcs7C2sDXyFWIY8S3Q.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6512c859344a8e0972cf089c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4291948,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Matthew Dove","original_name":"Matthew Dove","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6512c923344a8e097005a138","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4291951,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lisa Mead","original_name":"Lisa Mead","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6512c93ea9117f765d889e2d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1727350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Rosen","original_name":"Michael Rosen","popularity":0.0971,"profile_path":"/1IMA8m3NUQcs7C2sDXyFWIY8S3Q.jpg","credit_id":"6512c91226dac1014e23bc74","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4291948,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Matthew Dove","original_name":"Matthew Dove","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6512c930176a94013a9c74c5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9LbMfMZGxOwqv3GKcBxPCaFbVAI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
