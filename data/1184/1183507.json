What sounds like a pointless endeavor is perhaps the smartest solution. The Color Red is about learning to see red with different eyes. The film accompanies - representative of 8 billion pairs of eyes - an optical physicist and a painter in their preoccupation with the color red. The question of how different red can be is ultimately joined by curiosity: do we \"see\" the color without the film having to show it?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/zwompvcN3vH0UK2gWBSDgTpzc1U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Farbe Rot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4291007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Buchberger","original_name":"Christian Buchberger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6511f5403a4a1200ad9ada10","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4291008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Grebner","original_name":"Anna Grebner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6511f544e8d0b4014e0f3a0e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4291012,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sebastian Eggerbauer","original_name":"Sebastian Eggerbauer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6511f595a9117f00e193527a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4291012,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sebastian Eggerbauer","original_name":"Sebastian Eggerbauer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6511f59b344a8e0972ce642f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3983446,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michael Oberwallner","original_name":"Michael Oberwallner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6511f5a226dac100eb1b2c89","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zwompvcN3vH0UK2gWBSDgTpzc1U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
