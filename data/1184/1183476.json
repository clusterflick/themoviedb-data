In 1996, in his late 30s, he was on the cusp of becoming one the biggest DJs in the world. Robert Ferguson, already known as Fergie, was a 15-year-old budding DJ in a small town in Northern Ireland. At the same age, teenage rebel Andi Buckley had been kicked out of school and out of home in Birmingham – but had begun to work in the dance music industry. This powerful documentary tells the story of how the three men's lives became intertwined in a tale of love, loss, gay identity, hero worship, attitudes to AIDS and the 90s boom in dance music.","popularity":0.3387,"poster_path":"/zPhEbVfvdTHyAI7NaarDn4HixM2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143747,"logo_path":null,"name":"Relentless Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don't Ever Stop","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3214936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stuart Pollitt","original_name":"Stuart Pollitt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cc434d894ed6017c27530d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31510518","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tohMngcIn7KvTdE3iwQwMfAd6y3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zPhEbVfvdTHyAI7NaarDn4HixM2.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yOvDImBk8zqXSzbOr3LmAp65M8P.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BFI Flare London LGBTQIA+ Film Festival","release_date":"2024-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"DON’T EVER STOP: THE STORY OF TONY DE VIT - Trailer // DOC'N ROLL FILMS","key":"qWmmOv9zkq0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-09-19T08:39:40.000Z","id":"664bb739184a46317292bc31"}]}}}
