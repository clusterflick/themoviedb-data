The daring adventure begins by rebuilding three iconic vehicles - a communist era Skoda, an Indian road legend - an Ambassador and a 40 year old Renault 20, all bound for a grueling 10,000 kilometer (6250 miles) road trip from Central Europe to West Africa. Will they make it to the finish line? Trans-Saharan and African off-road rally racing come alive in this adventure documentary with breathtaking desert backdrops and vibrant African cultures.","popularity":0.2108,"poster_path":"/trHuRwkvBZrz72IC5mAvBlpNW3D.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rust to Glory, Driving and Surviving the Budapest-Bamako Rally","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4511270,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew G.
