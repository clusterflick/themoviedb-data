Join a diverse group of international artists as they explore the intersection of sustainability, community building, and art, and discover new solutions for addressing environmental challenges through collaboration and experimentation. The film also delves into the concept of \"Third Nature,\" a fascinating term from social ecology that challenges our traditional notions of the natural and human-made environment. With the inclusion of the first forest occupation in Luxembourg, the documentary showcases the power of community-led innovation, art, and activism in promoting a more sustainable future.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/uzVgq3qRFpdpo5BxC6LK7asv8qz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LU","name":"Luxembourg"}],"release_date":"2023-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Towards Third Nature","title":"Nomadic Island","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4291779,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mattia Mura Vannuzzi","original_name":"Mattia Mura Vannuzzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6512a8d126dac1014e23ae5c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uzVgq3qRFpdpo5BxC6LK7asv8qz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Ealing Film Festival","release_date":"2023-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
