Everything seems to be going great: the team reaches promotion to Serie B ( higher league) and, together with his wife, he finally opens the restaurant he has always wanted to, in order to stabilise the family's economic future. The long-awaited Serie B, however, turns out to be a doom: Claudio's contract is not renewed due to his age. It will be the beginning of the decline, as an athlete and as a man. Claudio will be dragged into a vortex of events that will undermine his certainties and his own moral rigor.","popularity":0.5088,"poster_path":"/dRX2KTzLfUktm34pXjnGHo8Nem9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":209013,"logo_path":null,"name":"Garden
