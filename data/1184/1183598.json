At Okinawa, over 250,000 soldiers fought a desperate, 82-day battle that only half would survive.  THE HISTORY CHANNEL takes a riveting look at one of the most storied engagements in military history. Participants, including General Victor Krulak and Colonel Joseph Alexander (author of Utmost Savagery), recall the extraordinary circumstances that made Okinawa unique and the all-or-nothing Japanese defense, which included guerilla tactics, female reinforcements, and wave after wave of kamikaze planes.  Rare and dramatic footage captures the chaos and destruction of this cataclysmic battle while military historians discuss its lasting legacy.  OKINAWA: THE LAST BATTLE offers a gripping portrait of one of the most bitter battles of the 20th century.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/dyyQVa9wPknD6ahqJXX5VTthB8G.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Okinawa: The Last Battle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dyyQVa9wPknD6ahqJXX5VTthB8G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ncmx1iZd1kz6h0jze094Rx23dPn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
