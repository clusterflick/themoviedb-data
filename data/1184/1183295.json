Sound was created by AI platform Melobytes, turning that same initial image of Ophelia to sound. The final result, based on the randomness and fluidity of the AI generators used, is a surreal animation where a classic theme (Ophelia) meets with weird dreamlike mutations and unexpected futuristic scenes.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/8kTsVFBNITDtpW5tjHUotitgttf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2023-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A.I.
