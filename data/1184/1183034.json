The film sets off stably in Ottinkâ€™s bathroom where she is having a shave, but when she subsequently steps into a melting snowy landscape, ideas start to change meaning in associative ways: razor blades, snowploughs, gender relations and identity politics. Everything is in a constant flux of permanent change, decay and remanifestation.","popularity":0.0683,"poster_path":"/1gOoA8HOLfEubzogGHWI3SbGK1M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2023-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"As political landscapes dissolve","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4289145,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zora Ottink","original_name":"Zora Ottink","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6510b571a3e4ba00fe31ea41","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4289145,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zora Ottink","original_name":"Zora Ottink","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6510b3ee3a4a1200ff4f1d09","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4289145,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zora Ottink","original_name":"Zora Ottink","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6510b3faa9117f00e192812a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4289145,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zora Ottink","original_name":"Zora Ottink","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6510b40126dac100ac08e123","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3785987,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Elf Godefroy","original_name":"Elf Godefroy","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6510b42626dac100caba621d","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4289150,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mike Ottink","original_name":"Mike Ottink","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6510b4c126dac100caba624b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3785987,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Elf Godefroy","original_name":"Elf Godefroy","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6510b4ca26dac1010c75b215","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4111372,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Levi Cuijpers","original_name":"Levi Cuijpers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6510b4d526dac100ac08e151","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3785987,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Elf Godefroy","original_name":"Elf Godefroy","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6510b4dd344a8e0970043524","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1gOoA8HOLfEubzogGHWI3SbGK1M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Netherlands Film Festival","release_date":"2023-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
