To achieve this stunning effect, Boyer re-photographed the entire feature using a specially made camera that slowly recorded images off of the screen. This one minute of film was then expanded to eight minutes, resulting in a re-examination of the entire structure of a feature film – dramatic line, duration relationships and a particulate disassembly of the frames themselves.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"George & Martha Revisited","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3105475,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Wayne Boyer","original_name":"Wayne Boyer","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6510dd816f974600c9e7b1e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1967-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
