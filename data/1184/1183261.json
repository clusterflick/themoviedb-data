Now that they are parents.  They now have to face a dilemma: Is the kid going to grow up or not in Armenia where 93% of the population is against and hostile to homosexuality? In his performance, Carabina struggles as a gay travesty since his childhood. His show follows his relationship with Hasmik, which permits us to distinguish the Carabina from the show and the real Carabina, a funny personality, eccentric, and full of drama. The show and the personal life create a parallel between the experience that Caribina creates during his show and the tragic homophobic reality he lives in. Witch could be considered as a “performance” of society. Meanwhile, Hasmik is working as a lawyer. in her cabinet and in court. She defends the rights of the LGBT community. We distinguish here Hasmik as a hard worker, a lawyer, and as a loving wife and mother at home.","popularity":0.0659,"poster_path":"/akO26a06urWCGzAh14jjJW5CEFn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","name":"Armenia"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Armenian","iso_639_1":"hy","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beauty and the Lawyer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2034966,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jean-Marie Gigon","original_name":"Jean-Marie Gigon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65119199e1faed00ae31144c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4290061,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hovhannes Ishkhanyan","original_name":"Hovhannes Ishkhanyan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651191673a4a1200e2959b2a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/526zD2E6CPqLmiW9PYmURE3134B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/akO26a06urWCGzAh14jjJW5CEFn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
