Setting out to tell the story of the slain revolutionary Saroj Dutta (lovingly known as comrade S.D.), the film gets drawn into a vortex of his tumultuous times, tracing turns and twists of the communist movement in India over three decades. A search by present-generation filmmakers, the film uses personal and public historical archives and conversations with rebels of the Naxalbari rebellion. Five decades later, the film holds a key to understanding the turbulent, audacious sixties and seventies in India and the world.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/m6pwlcgaa18vrMrvmqf9VKP5kYN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"S.D. : Saroj Dutta and His Times","video":false,"vote_average":2.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4289775,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mitali Biswas","original_name":"Mitali Biswas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6511748de8d0b4012d5e5947","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4289777,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kasturi Basu","original_name":"Kasturi Basu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651174a13a4a1200c5ab018c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t0Og8S4XBvSUH9FzAigSRXMvnTT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m6pwlcgaa18vrMrvmqf9VKP5kYN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BD","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kolkata People's Film Festival","release_date":"2018-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"SD: Saroj Dutta and His Times (2018) - Official Trailer","key":"b7eFoH1-VmY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-08-18T18:08:07.000Z","id":"651179c1344a8e0973ad51ae"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"SD (2016) | Excerpt | A documentary on Saroj Dutta","key":"bbd2FQm60G4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2016-08-04T18:27:32.000Z","id":"651179fca9117f011b21617a"}]}}}
