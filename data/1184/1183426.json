Those who listen to it remain motionless in contemplation.  Between bodies, the Patagonian landscape and the crossing of boundaries with the private record of a vacation, Narcisa Hirsch and Rafael Maino unfold among the melodies of a passage from Orphee et Eurydice. This film also bears the name \"Rafael, 1976\" and can be considered part of the series of the diaries with \"Rafael, agosto 1984\".","popularity":0.0757,"poster_path":"/oYT5Yo5R7Qe1Wsc1Lld4ysAIRoU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"1976-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orpheus and Eurydice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1523322,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Narcisa Hirsch","original_name":"Narcisa Hirsch","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6511d199e8d0b4014e0f314f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oYT5Yo5R7Qe1Wsc1Lld4ysAIRoU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
