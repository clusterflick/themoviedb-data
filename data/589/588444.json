The devoutly Christian choir grew up in churches strongly allied with Israel. On their first trip to the Holy Land they witness the harsh realities of life under occupation, a nonviolent movement for justice, and an assassination. Our story is a unique view of a crucial human rights conflict. Mixing the excitement of foot-stomping gospel music and creative theater it reveals the power of art to communicate, heal, and give voice to communities living in fear. It is a cultural exchange of immense depth and far-reaching implications, where, during the course of the journey, people's preconceptions are radically changed.","popularity":0.3595,"poster_path":"/iHOaGSswQJ1X8akp7oqtq6bEPuk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Al Helm: Martin Luther King in Palestine","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1756743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramzi Maqdisi","original_name":"Ramzi Maqdisi","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/itNMDU9QBX7TaD8voqzkX9kDWj7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Martin Luther King, Jr.","credit_id":"5c8c5b7a0e0a2612fc520a9e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgina Asfour","original_name":"Georgina Asfour","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Coretta Scott King","credit_id":"5c8c5b930e0a2612fa520985","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266075,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohammed Al-Basha","original_name":"Mohammed Al-Basha","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Southerner FBI Police","credit_id":"5c8c5ba50e0a2613025221ff","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1585765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kamel El Basha","original_name":"Kamel El Basha","popularity":0.1646,"profile_path":"/x7y9taclO7bfZGW024ESN66SAxm.jpg","credit_id":"5c8c5bce0e0a2613045213bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1012161,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Connie Field","original_name":"Connie Field","popularity":0.055,"profile_path":"/a2lJhidzClwrV6via7TF93UEr1K.jpg","credit_id":"5c8c5be6c3a368611f47a8f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2191562","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":830,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iHOaGSswQJ1X8akp7oqtq6bEPuk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":560}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":155876,"name":"reenactment"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
