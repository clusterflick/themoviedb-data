I enjoyed AVATAR and HUGO, though not much else among the movies I’ve seen in illusionary depth. They place things in depth but don’t go at depth as a realm to be investigated, toyed with; no mindbenders other than story. Cezanne, Cubism, never happened. This movie begins to play with possibility, with things only sometimes appearing real.\" - Ken Jacobs","popularity":0.1047,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joys of Waiting for the Broadway Bus #3","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Jacobs","original_name":"Ken Jacobs","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/lLWmlUKswUHhW6TEHD4i56xleke.jpg","credit_id":"5c8eb97cc3a36861194cbe0a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
