What used to be a pre Incan fishing town has become a privileged beach resort after the Spanish colony. With an observational lens, En Ancón ( In Ancon) explores the space of memory to uncover the filmmaker’s childhood. With distance in time and space, and with the desire to observe and re-examine a place from the past, comes a new gaze and an evolution of thought and awareness.  The separation provides the opportunity of seeing things as they are. With space and time comes clarity. The filmmaker is familiar to this place, but has now grown from being born into this system and with this mentality. Through the nostalgic eyes of adulthood En Ancón sheds light to expose the existing barriers of class segregation that pertain in Peru. It also investigates the process of realizing the system we are in, in order to break off from it, and the process of change as a path to liberation.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Ancon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2204354,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrea Franco","original_name":"Andrea Franco","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c8ae9c4925141058ec11b84","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
