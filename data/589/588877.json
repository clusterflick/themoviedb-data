The process introduces emphatic flicker that helps create illusions of depth, even for a single eye. But flicker is not for everyone and should be avoided by those with unusual brain conditions.  Abstract-Expressionism was a way out of thinking of WWII and Mitchell was among the best of its practitioners.
