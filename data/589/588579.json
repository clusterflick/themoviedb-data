As his marriage to Sarah begins to crumble when he loses his job and thinking that life couldn't get any worse, it does. Bitter towards God and going nowhere fast, Daniel must learn to trust God again before he loses it all for good. For Sarah, as tensions in the marriage rise, she falls out of love. Only to be confronted with whether she can still believe in her marriage and in hope once again. Meanwhile, their children Lea and Jonah are going through their personal journeys, with Lea having to learn to trust her parents and Jonah having to overcome his individual fears. Trust asks the age old question of 'How do we trust God, when life is falling apart? And carries a thread of relevance to everyone that no matter what you're going through, 'Never give up on hope'.","popularity":0.3559,"poster_path":"/dPxFuxa7qYkwhhKKQMWX15ogRPo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trust","video":false,"vote_average":3.4,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2628801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Austring","original_name":"Keith Austring","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Daniel Rainwater","credit_id":"5eb41611cc277c002167024c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2628802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Carey","original_name":"Lisa Carey","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Sarah Rainwater","credit_id":"5eb41643cc277c0020669626","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1186663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chelsea Bennett","original_name":"Chelsea Bennett","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/apKN4gPTJACbl4kAHzMLeLV2iiC.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lea Rainwater","credit_id":"5eb41660f3e0df001e2b400a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2628812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lachlan smith","original_name":"Lachlan smith","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Johnah Rainwater","credit_id":"5eb41802f3e0df001e2b430d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":217617,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Simon Gray","original_name":"Simon Gray","popularity":0.071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Jimmy","credit_id":"5eb418280cb335001fc7d248","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2628814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yannick Lawry","original_name":"Yannick Lawry","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Nick","credit_id":"5eb4183d0cb3350021c83f20","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1094876,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Angus Benfield","original_name":"Angus Benfield","popularity":0.1183,"profile_path":"/v8xaNtdgIVNJEhjWyc7soJeKAWH.jpg","credit_id":"5eb415e5c3514c002055b743","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1094876,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Angus Benfield","original_name":"Angus Benfield","popularity":0.1183,"profile_path":"/v8xaNtdgIVNJEhjWyc7soJeKAWH.jpg","credit_id":"5eb415f1cc277c0021670226","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5541186","wikidata_id":"Q127600293","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/16YVuJdECeL2MphUPrdTi86bbw2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dPxFuxa7qYkwhhKKQMWX15ogRPo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.723,"height":1375,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/ocHrDQO4stYU5HOUqHKGyEIAlH3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":994}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":253695,"name":"christian film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
