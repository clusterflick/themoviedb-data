But maiden thought naught of my lord o' the manor, nor so much as gave him cause to hope that all his castles and lands could win her heart from the true peasant lad who had gone forth in the world to win humble living for his bride to be. It was then that Dame Poverty came knocking at the peasant's door and upon her heels crept a fever which held the young sister close within her breast only waiting for death to knock gently at the humble cot. And still no word from the loved one in a foreign land! Had he deserted his fond-hearted lassie? Weeks passed by and still no word nor sign of the one held most dear, and then my lord of Glenwood Keep came suing for her hand.","popularity":0.1396,"poster_path":"/oR41m7LDdxhzX9V3ZE79THP0aBk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18758,"logo_path":"/fe3cMUJLhbkTM9PDxdDA8hQpAxp.png","name":"Edison Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lord and the Peasant","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Augustus Phillips","original_name":"Augustus Phillips","popularity":0.0893,"profile_path":"/lvjk6PPiFAmQrTY18tmG2TaJ9KT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Peasant","credit_id":"5c8e971f0e0a26130456c6ce","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1285200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miriam Nesbitt","original_name":"Miriam Nesbitt","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/yXzMNXHYQaNVf96UI0cidc6wwVc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mary","credit_id":"5c8e972d0e0a26130256b4aa","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28968,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"J.
