Adongo lives in East Africa in the near future, while Apio lives on a distant planet far into the next millennium, but the pair are almost identical. When the boundary between their worlds collapses, the two women discover that each is the creation of the other â€” that they are both protagonists in the novel the other is striving to complete. As they scramble to understand the nature of their existence and the strange nature of their connection, reality and fantasy blur, and the women are tasked with finding a way to avoid descending into madness.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UG","name":"Uganda"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Two women.
