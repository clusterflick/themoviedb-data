This project uses the medium of film and aerial dance to distort the audience’s perception of what is physically possible, altering reality and creating an illusionary body/spirit dissociation.  The film creators draw from Limerick's history and culture to influence both the narrative and some of the film’s imagery. The title alludes both to the well-known Irish dance and to stories of the city, from the Vikings and the siege of Limerick (1690) to the current cultural and social realities of Limerick.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/n7dFX2uXUSOHwOMWzlblurOE2N5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145623,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kat and Dawg","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2019-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walls of Limerick","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2894591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathryn Cooley","original_name":"Kathryn Cooley","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"5fd896d4cf4b8b003d9c0029","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2894592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Máire Dee","original_name":"Máire Dee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"5fd896ec681888003f9a26a7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266043,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arturo Bandinelli","original_name":"Arturo Bandinelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c8c3cf7c3a368610b475fb9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2164822,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrea Boccadoro","original_name":"Andrea Boccadoro","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd896fecf4b8b003f9b80ff","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2894591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathryn Cooley","original_name":"Kathryn Cooley","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd896dea127e50042144bb1","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266043,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arturo Bandinelli","original_name":"Arturo Bandinelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd8970f9408ec003ddb6ef2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2894592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Máire Dee","original_name":"Máire Dee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd896f41d3143003cbc2c0f","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266043,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arturo Bandinelli","original_name":"Arturo Bandinelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd89707a127e50041141380","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11889892","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/n7dFX2uXUSOHwOMWzlblurOE2N5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Suspension and Screendance Festival","release_date":"2019-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"National Gallery of Art: International Festival of Films on Art: Selections","release_date":"2020-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"WALLS OF LIMERICK_Trailer","key":"315113175","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-02-03T18:40:24.000Z","id":"5fd89741db952d003d7e9e71"}]}}}
