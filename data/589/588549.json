Featuring Snarky Puppy band-mates Michael League (electric and upright bass) and Robert Sput Searight (drums), with contributions from percussionist Felix Higgenbottom and a full string section and French horn.  This is a truly great contemporary jazz piano concert with nods to modal jazz icon Bill Evans, post-Coltrane piano giants McCoy Tyner and Herbie Hancock, and the fusion of Joe Zawinul & Chick Corea.","popularity":0.0721,"poster_path":"/963WblME0HOR9jSvjfJdhKvouVh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bill Laurance - Live at Union Chapel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Laurance","original_name":"Bill Laurance","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Piano","credit_id":"5c8d28370e0a261304539c82","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2266388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael League","original_name":"Michael League","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/yOruQtVd5vdkffRpPhHwcLKpppN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Bass","credit_id":"5c8d28510e0a2612f553a037","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266389,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert 'Sput' Searight","original_name":"Robert 'Sput' Searight","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Drums","credit_id":"5c8d2860c3a3686107491d0c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Felix Higginbottom","original_name":"Felix Higginbottom","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Percussion","credit_id":"5c8d286fc3a3686107491d64","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vera Van Der Bie","original_name":"Vera Van Der Bie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Violin","credit_id":"5c8d28839251410ff69f0536","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabella Petersen","original_name":"Isabella Petersen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Viola","credit_id":"5c8d28999251410fed9f094c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Tangberg","original_name":"Annie Tangberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Cello","credit_id":"5c8d28a40e0a261304539ced","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katie Christie","original_name":"Katie Christie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"French Horn","credit_id":"5c8d28b0c3a368611f493f11","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266395,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bill Laurance","original_name":"Bill Laurance","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c8d28cec3a3686111493214","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266396,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simon Hendry","original_name":"Simon Hendry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c8d28e00e0a26130253a890","department":"Sound","job":"Recording Supervision"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266397,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nic Hard","original_name":"Nic Hard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c8d28ed9251410ffc9f06c6","department":"Crew","job":"Mixing Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266398,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andy Laviolette","original_name":"Andy Laviolette","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c8d290ec3a368611f493f7a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1369,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yRdALfVfkzj1acURfZIPOfTRZl0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2434}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/963WblME0HOR9jSvjfJdhKvouVh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-04-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
