The film begins with a sequence of dreams, but the dream events are repeated in the real world and have their continuation. Everything ends well. This is how the plot looks like in a nutshell. But the mood and atmosphere of the film is difficult to verbalize, because it is assumed to be ambiguous, just as the painting of Stasys Eidrigevičius is ambiguous.","popularity":0.0832,"poster_path":"/90KIor4nZOjxzAtbyxTfjPMQBpz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62703,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Filmowe Anima-Pol","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":6480,"logo_path":"/qJUUNzFYXNUDaisssBTV3Zdki9R.png","name":"TVP","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":2466,"logo_path":"/596Eq7ivA0DpNfB5zzDU7yMeTB4.png","name":"Wytwórnia Filmów Dokumentalnych i Fabularnych","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dobranocka","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4183101,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jadwiga Wendorff","original_name":"Jadwiga Wendorff","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650e2f3226dac100cab90586","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4245586,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anna Ewert","original_name":"Anna Ewert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650e2f12e8d0b4010ce29e44","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4285947,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mariusz Roszak","original_name":"Mariusz Roszak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650e2ef721621d00ea3bfd6b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1173561,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jerzy Satanowski","original_name":"Jerzy Satanowski","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/jcJSUa1uIC89rvTKiRksuyxUhdo.jpg","credit_id":"650e2f07f29d6600ff3b4a05","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1126160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Szczechura","original_name":"Daniel Szczechura","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650e2ed2a9117f00e1914329","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4245588,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eugeniusz Gordziejuk","original_name":"Eugeniusz Gordziejuk","popularity":0.0801,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650e2f2221621d00aca7904e","department":"Production","job":"Production Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3813052,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jan Wojciechowski","original_name":"Jan Wojciechowski","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650e2eebe1faed00ae2f0adc","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1126160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Szczechura","original_name":"Daniel Szczechura","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c8d67710e0a261304541989","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/90KIor4nZOjxzAtbyxTfjPMQBpz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pl","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
