As the aria goes: 'Et je tremble délicieusement au souvenir charmant du premier jour d'amour! (And I tremble deliciously at the delightful memory of the first day of love!)' – Her reveries feature Tilda Swinton and Spencer Leigh wandering around the topiaries of Swinton's family garden and at various seaside locations. The film was made for Aria (1987),  the portmanteau project of producer Don Boyd who invited ten directors to create short films set to operatic arias of their choice. The particular performance used in Depuis le jour is by esteemed African-American soprano Leontyne Price.","popularity":0.3894,"poster_path":"/1jDXJRshOMj4K5ULrArUTCXBxLy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Depuis le Jour","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tilda Swinton","original_name":"Tilda Swinton","popularity":3.0652,"profile_path":"/gWbX3a7V2MgRMRzekfITNcb27xV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5c8f914ac3a3687406487122","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":186272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aimée Delamain","original_name":"Aimée Delamain","popularity":0.1607,"profile_path":"/brsWTYLhNEKw4iSj7GrU51fQ4dy.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"665622bf5b5ba82d7d1fd248","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1050726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Spencer Leigh","original_name":"Spencer Leigh","popularity":0.1999,"profile_path":"/YZLWvqXDu8Th4YbTHW5sIeN40t.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"665622df3c7a97692c70756b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1248656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leontyne Price","original_name":"Leontyne Price","popularity":0.096,"profile_path":"/4ItBqAJCC5q7pWNXLbB6tOuX2Uw.jpg","credit_id":"665621e9e5727c416919ddd5","department":"Sound","job":"Vocals"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3427350,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gustave Charpentier","original_name":"Gustave Charpentier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665624a98de90543cda3e7c7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25012,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mike Southon","original_name":"Mike Southon","popularity":0.0502,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665625969b57f1503c511a33","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86290,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Derek Jarman","original_name":"Derek Jarman","popularity":0.2281,"profile_path":"/vozzl6a3kqNJhWo7AheLMp81xVn.jpg","credit_id":"5c8f9157c3a36861194e5ae6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":79624,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Don Boyd","original_name":"Don Boyd","popularity":0.1145,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c8f9191c3a36861164e9717","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1jDXJRshOMj4K5ULrArUTCXBxLy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":508}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
