Dick, the captain charged with pilot instruction, leads Jim through every aspect of preparation to fly the bomber, going through a detailed checklist of pre-flight procedures, long before he allows Jim to turn an engine over. Once preparations are completed, Dick shows Jim the process of starting the engines, followed by take-off. In the air, further instruction helps Jim understand the various limits and capabilities of the aircraft. When one engine fails, Dick must simultaneously guide the limping plane back to a safe landing and explain to Jim each step of the procedure.","popularity":0.664,"poster_path":"/120R63GbySUWrZLc3CkRDGJgIfC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101192,"logo_path":null,"name":"First Motion Picture Unit, United States Army Air Forces","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1944-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How to Fly the B-26 Airplane","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Porter","original_name":"Don Porter","popularity":0.2993,"profile_path":"/99kJqipIP5WldysBO77kaox8Zyg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Captain Dick","credit_id":"5c8a5b12c3a36824bf0ccb6d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Craig Stevens","original_name":"Craig Stevens","popularity":0.3353,"profile_path":"/pUql174UjOqrMLcHyzwhdho2goq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lieutenant Jim Anthony","credit_id":"5c8a5b200e0a26042bc45753","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34625,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Wilcox","original_name":"Frank Wilcox","popularity":0.2634,"profile_path":"/hlqDTFrYD0l91GhwDaepxaZ2euc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Colonel","credit_id":"5c8a5b2ec3a36864550d7f0b","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0461522","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.599,"height":925,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/120R63GbySUWrZLc3CkRDGJgIfC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":554}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1944-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
