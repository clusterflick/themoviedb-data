She allegedly murdered a Canadian tourist before disappearing without a trace. At least that is how the narrator, who was passing through the region at the time, remembers the story. Over the course of the interviews, the elusive Valérie seems to disappear a second time, literally engulfed by the Alpine landscape, magnificently captured on film by François Caillat. A haunting, imposing landscape, where chasms and precipices become metaphors, characters in a work of fiction that the camera turns into a documentary. A film in the form of an essay in which the director takes his work on memory to its highest degree of abstraction.","popularity":0.1774,"poster_path":"/86uIm96FLjCeCTGY2WHIjv9lKwy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":2695,"logo_path":null,"name":"Archipel 33>35","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":16180,"logo_path":"/tE5t6MnMhvyc34beR4Qf6hM2c5K.png","name":"INA","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2004-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'affaire Valérie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":978360,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Martine Bouquin","original_name":"Martine Bouquin","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c8f6a2cc3a3681c954b3304","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1165237,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"François Caillat","original_name":"François Caillat","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c8f69e00e0a2612f558704d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1200703,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jacques Besse","original_name":"Jacques Besse","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c8f6a169251413440a10f53","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0885064","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fg6vtoqceApuJ1xhntQlDbddTZ8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/86uIm96FLjCeCTGY2WHIjv9lKwy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":170487,"name":"essay film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"FIDMarseille ","release_date":"2004-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer documental \"El caso Valerie\"","key":"g4-1n7UvsdY","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2011-08-01T17:30:41.000Z","id":"5c8f6c000e0a2612fc584edc"}]}}}
