We see him seated tete-a-tete with a very pretty girl, indulging in the luxury of a particularly magnificent lobster for dinner. It is, of course, quite inconceivable that Bill should do anything without its having some astonishing consequence, and the effect of the succulent crustacean is in nowise disappointing. Immediately he finishes his repast, Bill is seized with most alarming spasms, and then, apparently taking on the habits of the shellfish he devoured, commences to walk backwards out of the room. Tripping up at the top of the stairs, he falls down headforemost and then leaps backward into the street, where he seeks refuge in a waiting carriage.","popularity":0.1228,"poster_path":"/qhWJyOWzpfeWK6zuSyESQrUWbS4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12243,"logo_path":"/hztlrOaMK77kKdErDwogso0m2YS.png","name":"Lux Compagnie Cinématographique de France","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1911-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Patouillard a mangé du homard","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Bill Buys a Lobster","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1483891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Bertho","original_name":"Paul Bertho","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/1EDRyblUIaGHqqi2Hjc9dsOiaGe.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Patouillard","credit_id":"5c8e89a20e0a2612f15689a2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1144929,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Romeo Bosetti","original_name":"Romeo Bosetti","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/fcIANwE4rSLFdjhlcNVhf8PUkp9.jpg","credit_id":"5c8e89850e0a2612f1568986","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0481154","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qhWJyOWzpfeWK6zuSyESQrUWbS4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1911-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Patouillard a mangé du homard","key":"e4XiL2PXS34","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-01-03T13:20:05.000Z","id":"67821d0578cfcd77ed4e8b1d"}]}}}
