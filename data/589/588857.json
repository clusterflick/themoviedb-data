She has an American suitor, William Brooks, who is deeply in love with her but he is given little encouragement. Mr. Clayworth plans to discourage his daughter with nobility and accordingly goes to an employment agency where he engages three foreign menials to impersonate noblemen, supplying them with evening clothes and arranging to have them call at his house that evening. Bessie is overjoyed when she learns from father that three noblemen are to honor them with their presence. Father incidentally suggests that if the noblemen do not come up to her expectations to patch up her little quarrel with Billy and say no more about marrying a title. The fun begins when the three bogus noblemen present themselves at Clayworth's house as Duke Macaroni, Lord Brien Berue and Baron Hasenpfeffer.","popularity":0.1129,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":18758,"logo_path":"/fe3cMUJLhbkTM9PDxdDA8hQpAxp.png","name":"Edison Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Title Cure","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268672,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Wadsworth","original_name":"William Wadsworth","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":"/9RuDXr6YGN2nHmQNaK7axKnhDw8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Baron Hasenpfeffer - the German","credit_id":"5c8e9f3b0e0a26130256cbab","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1422732,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward O’Connor","original_name":"Edward O’Connor","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":"/qqe3cswsuupgC6LvKQoJBvBY2qb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lord Brian Berue - the Irishman","credit_id":"5c8e9f5ec3a36861114c70f0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1319139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gertrude McCoy","original_name":"Gertrude McCoy","popularity":0.076,"profile_path":"/tneqF59Pgj02UajLvI7mENYjIFu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Bessie Clayworth","credit_id":"64806018d2b209014e06e32e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1685189,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Ridgely","original_name":"Richard Ridgely","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Duke Macaroni","credit_id":"6480604099259c00c5b29f9c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Augustus Phillips","original_name":"Augustus Phillips","popularity":0.0893,"profile_path":"/lvjk6PPiFAmQrTY18tmG2TaJ9KT.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Billy Brooks","credit_id":"6480607264765400e67fbc43","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yale Boss","original_name":"Yale Boss","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":"/zpjGvSXtYKejqylKaFp5w6zD5Gk.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Office Boy","credit_id":"6480608ebf31f2013adc5737","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1420046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank A.
