Protests, began in England and soon spread to the rest of the Islamic world, culminating in February 1989 with Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini issuing a fatwa - a death sentence on the writer.  Now, 30 years on, Mobeen Azhar embarks on a journey to examine the lasting effect the book has had on the Muslim community, and continue to have an impact today. Mobeen hears from a range of people affected by the so called 'Rushdie Affair' - from the men who took an early stand against the book; to a writer who wrestled with the book's publication, complex questions of free speech, and her own religious beliefs; and a former member of the National Front who claims that the furor over the book became a recruiting tool for them.","popularity":0.0585,"poster_path":"/gBQoiLBJCa4F6px2v8riNNX8EWE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17209,"logo_path":"/khOQX3iJuSmaFWrL3w4LijbtnJZ.png","name":"VICE Media","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Mobeen Azhar examines the lasting effects of Salman Rushdie's novel The Satanic Verses.","title":"The Satanic Verses: 30 Years On","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2266660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mobeen Azhar","original_name":"Mobeen Azhar","popularity":0.0902,"profile_path":"/edJPu6tQIrKQ7E6wmb50EwDtyUl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself - Reporter","credit_id":"5c8da3ac9251410ff4a00afd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sadia Hameed","original_name":"Sadia Hameed","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5c8da3cb0e0a261302549bf6","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9832674","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":995,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oOJ2ifFX8tGYPa2975PxWeMXjQo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1769}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uHGzKHgVCmGGkUpSZv5gyKHqRgb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gBQoiLBJCa4F6px2v8riNNX8EWE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Pakistan: 30 years after Rushdie's 'Satanic Verses'","key":"Ten-OKwBHEM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2019-02-11T19:21:43.000Z","id":"5c8da560c3a3682ece476985"}]}}}
