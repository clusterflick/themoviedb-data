They met on the Monte Bianco, they climbed it together and fell in love.\r Their great alpine years go exactly from 1932 to 1936 – the year in which they got married. They, as a roped party, pioneered some of the toughest alpine routes. They used to keep journals and take pictures in order to keep a record of their achievements.\r Ninì, that was one of the very few female climbers of those years, would carry a 16mm film camera with her, during her climbs.\r In 1937, their son Lorenzo was born, and, in 1938, Gabriele died, falling from a mountain wall. Ninì, then, gave up extreme climbing and focused on her role as a mother.  Some years after Ninì’s death, in 2000, her son Lorenzo found the reels his mother had been shooting, hidden in an old case.","popularity":0.2359,"poster_path":"/32BNZsIbXbUKH8KPCUbYkRgX63s.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145645,"logo_path":null,"name":"Associazione La Fournaise","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nini","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nini Pietrasanta","original_name":"Nini Pietrasanta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5c8e0e449251410ff6a0cf1b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriele Boccalatte","original_name":"Gabriele Boccalatte","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c8e0e4fc3a36861074b031b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3343939,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gian Luigi Giustiniani","original_name":"Gian Luigi Giustiniani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b4cda8037264001ca8f8a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4727343,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Raffaele Rezzonico","original_name":"Raffaele Rezzonico","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664cca4373cdb44bbf302c8d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2895159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eleonora Mastropietro","original_name":"Eleonora Mastropietro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664cca5427c0e69319ed973d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4727344,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniele Ietri","original_name":"Daniele Ietri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664cca638ee7f81e2d931b84","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/32BNZsIbXbUKH8KPCUbYkRgX63s.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":532},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5zrZAWJFb0R9gKQKN8SN52LLMW1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4560,"name":"mountaineer"},{"id":8624,"name":"climbing"},{"id":250025,"name":"alpinist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2014-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
