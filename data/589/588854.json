The film takes the viewer on a journey through the forest in all seasons and shows the important work being done by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and the Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry.  Cathedral talks about the history of Cook Forest State Park, which is a registered National Natural Landmark, and explains how the hemlock tree is a keystone species, influencing everything from water temperature to bird populations.  Cook Forest is home to the one of the last, best remaining stands of old-growth forest in the United States, and is considered by many to contain the best remaining old-growth hemlock.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Fight to Save the Ancient Hemlocks of Cook Forest","title":"Cathedral: The Fight to Save the Ancient Hemlocks of Cook Forest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
