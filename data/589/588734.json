Parking lots, hen houses, and brownstone apartments become the dwellings of many strange creatures; coyotes are rendered forest spirits, neighbors as martians, and night crawlers as flesh-eating meteorite worms. Employing sci-fi, documentary and ethnography techniques, a state of mind particular to early youth is sublimated - weight is lent to shadows as vast as space, ripe with discoveries both minuscule and immense.","popularity":0.0591,"poster_path":"/5oeLrO9K9CkvV0CJW8jdCO9QD8P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Black Hole is a Black Hole in the Ground","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Черная дыра это черная дыра в земле","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophia Feuer","original_name":"Sophia Feuer","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c8e33c60e0a2612fc55cb75","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266853,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tyler Macri","original_name":"Tyler Macri","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c8e33d6c3a36861114b775f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266853,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tyler Macri","original_name":"Tyler Macri","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c8e33df9251410ffca11b04","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophia Feuer","original_name":"Sophia Feuer","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c8e33e80e0a26130255d023","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266856,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hanna Feuer","original_name":"Hanna Feuer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c8e33f1c3a368610b4b336b","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266857,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Charlie Gill","original_name":"Charlie Gill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c8e340292514134409e7c9f","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophia Feuer","original_name":"Sophia Feuer","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c8e340f0e0a2612fc55cc9f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266853,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tyler Macri","original_name":"Tyler Macri","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c8e341ec3a36861074b62b8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophia Feuer","original_name":"Sophia Feuer","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c8e3426c3a3681c95489f38","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9237472","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5oeLrO9K9CkvV0CJW8jdCO9QD8P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"Moscow International Documentary Film Festival DOKer","release_date":"2019-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moviate Underground Film Festival","release_date":"2020-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
