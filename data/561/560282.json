After clinging lovingly to his ma, he is induced to abandon his strangle hold, and he is taken into the drafting room. Here two clerks make merry with him, but he managed to even matters unconsciously by leaning on the heavy end of a table, upsetting it and all on it. Now his employers tell him to carry a set of plans, papers and instruments, with which he is to accompany them to a building. In the course of construction, Jim reaches to the top of a closet for some of the papers, upsets it, breaks some more furniture and finally reaches the street, struggling under a mass of paraphernalia, with which he strews his path as he goes.","popularity":0.1238,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1908-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'apprenti architecte","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Jim Gets a New Job","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1167399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Deed","original_name":"André Deed","popularity":0.3646,"profile_path":"/prazmRnbuIUeHO6McGOUQHDUeOd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Boireau","credit_id":"5be4272dc3a36810bd02a6c4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1488535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henri Gambart","original_name":"Henri Gambart","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be427129251415c69029604","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0451293","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1908-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
