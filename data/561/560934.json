We fight a Sisyphean battle with it in our homes. It makes us sneeze. What could be more mundane? But those tiny specks actually have astonishing power. This 26-minute documentary film takes you on an eye-opening journey with dust from the microscopic to the global scale. Along the way, you’ll meet scientists on the cutting edge of dust research, as well as a couple whose lives have been dramatically altered by dust. You’ll discover that dust can be both life-giving and deadly in turn, and that its impact is shifting as Earth’s climate warms.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dust Rising","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2173013,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lauren Schwartzman","original_name":"Lauren Schwartzman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be76b3092514143f501a27e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
