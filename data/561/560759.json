Through his memories, the film presents a story that embraces two generations and various eras. It is a film about the tragedy of lives dragged into conflicts against their will, of lives violently ruined or ended – a story about the devastating consequences of war. Interweaving past and present, the flashback narrative depicts the war as a perpetual situation where the “little people” always turn out to be on the losing side.","popularity":0.1149,"poster_path":"/a3aBXR9nL8XoqHIoXU2gqHwEQet.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13644,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studioul Cinematografic
