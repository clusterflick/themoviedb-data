The symptoms are very severe, many cases leading to the death of most trees. As a result, it is assumed that the ash tree in Europe will soon be close to extinct. Choreographer and dancer Dagmar Dachauer was inspired by the sad faith of the European ash tree, and linked it to the personal loss in her own life. Finis est cinis: Ash is what remains. Ash is a eulogy for the ash tree and for Prasthan Dachauer, who passed away in 2016.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/yukJBmMUubrfTm57LlrH3ssXmto.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2017-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"‘The death of a species, especially a species as significant as the ash, punches a hole not only in nature, but also in our culture.’ - George Monbiot","title":"Competing for Sunlight: Ash","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2170716,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dagmar Dachauer","original_name":"Dagmar Dachauer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be359160e0a2614ae01d9ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yukJBmMUubrfTm57LlrH3ssXmto.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
