His heart bled at the thought of losing her, his life-long loyal helpmate. And his opera was almost completed, after spending months of weary hours to make it perfect. A pretty daughter tried in vain to brighten the overhanging gloom. Finally the composer, after a superhuman effort, and with a soul filled with sorrow, finished the last act of his score and hurried away to the impresario for a hearing. Here he was assured of an immediate reading and the return to his humble tenement was made with a much lighter heart. The doctor paid another visit to his patient and left a prescription to be filled. Carl reached home and realized how much depended upon the medicine ordered to possibly save a life most dear. Taking his cherished violin, the only article of value remaining, he rushed off to the pawnbroker and negotiated a loan.","popularity":0.1734,"poster_path":"/kFVHePklp02RYIaNMG9PjpV4rhd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61706,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eclair American","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1911-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Musician's Daughter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2171209,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Scott","original_name":"Grace Scott","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Alma Wagner - the Musician's Daughter","credit_id":"5be471519251415c7e02e310","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2171211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William S.
