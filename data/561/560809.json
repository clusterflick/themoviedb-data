In Jia’s segment, a Chinese couple in the ancient town of Pingyao attempts to breathe new life into their old love as they ponder having a second child. Pingyao, home to the film festival Jia has co-founded, is a highly picturesque UNESCO World Heritage Site, and Jia humorously plays with a very recent dilemma – the second child policy dates from only 2013 – in a setting itself forcibly revived from history.","popularity":0.2127,"poster_path":"/fTeW1fT9MoIxceYFQ4pZpRDwjAE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2017-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Revive","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"Féng chūn","type":"pronunciation"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":24044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zhao Tao","original_name":"Zhao Tao","popularity":0.3496,"profile_path":"/dHcZ83DLBcWKxKHtVkTkBlS49fE.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5be6865892514143ee00b558","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liang Jingdong","original_name":"Liang Jingdong","popularity":0.3543,"profile_path":"/d3KpBTePZwZxgYJ4y91FMo36IU2.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6563ad96a6c10400aca8682e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jia Zhangke","original_name":"Jia Zhangke","popularity":0.5362,"profile_path":"/oMWMIBAjyAscFe3xlqJ5Qugg6yS.jpg","credit_id":"5be6869b92514143e200aef8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jia Zhangke","original_name":"Jia Zhangke","popularity":0.5362,"profile_path":"/oMWMIBAjyAscFe3xlqJ5Qugg6yS.jpg","credit_id":"5be686fdc3a368173000b420","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1425035,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Matthieu Laclau","original_name":"Matthieu Laclau","popularity":0.2937,"profile_path":"/uJrbn70TJyMfRXDBoKkA4YhzZcJ.jpg","credit_id":"5be687b0c3a368173d00dba0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25472,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lim Giong","original_name":"Lim Giong","popularity":0.1152,"profile_path":"/86K1ZzLANr8CtiyIEg2L4tkqwA4.jpg","credit_id":"5be687ddc3a368174a00aad8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25471,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nelson Yu Lik-wai","original_name":"Nelson Yu Lik-wai","popularity":0.0785,"profile_path":"/ewJrzbA5YwL9EwRu98R7XrJwfYq.jpg","credit_id":"5f95b0f41fd36f005047d40f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fTeW1fT9MoIxceYFQ4pZpRDwjAE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2017-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
