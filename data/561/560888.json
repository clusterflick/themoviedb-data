These trips close in on themselves forming a continuous loop where the tale gets lost in the eternal recurrence. Traversée is above all a moveable scene, an in-between, a poetic metaphor for the political situation between France and North Africa. A space for contemplation and tension, an endless journey, an invitation.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/gvbQI6btSeXPNkRFkM3q6GNAIDu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2013-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Corsican","iso_639_1":"co","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Traversée","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1172315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ange Leccia","original_name":"Ange Leccia","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be7225e0e0a263bfc015042","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7798822","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.566,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gvbQI6btSeXPNkRFkM3q6GNAIDu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":611}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
