These activities provide subsistence and an income in an area where formal employment is virtually non-existent. The film explores the values, opportunities and challenges of living in a communal area in South Africa. It also contrasts this with the monoculture model of large scale commercial agriculture and questions why government support for such a sustainable, resilient and eco-friendly lifestyle is so hard to find. Its goal is to raise awareness around the need for infrastructure development and support in such areas to make them more supportive of peopleâ€™s needs and aspirations","popularity":0.0502,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Footnotes In The City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kN7lMBNm8Loi1rbMfIoHt7FLOF0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
