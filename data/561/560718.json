In the meantime, these theories have been rejected, and this film is known to be a part of a larger film, \"Krunisanje kralja Petra I Karađorđevića i putovanje kroz Srbiju, Novi Pazar, Crnu Goru i Dalmaciju\" (\"The coronation of king Peter I of Serbia and a ride trough Serbia, Novi-Bazar, Montenegro and Dalmatia\"), by F.S.
