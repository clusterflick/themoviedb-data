Arbenz had led the successful 1944 revolt against the military dictatorship, a regime that had oppressed Guatemala since colonialism. Arbenz, the son of Swiss immigrants, was celebrated as a national hero. Elected President in 1950, Arbenz was not a member of any party - he didn't issue any manifestos. But he began to fulfill his promises - farmers got their own land. 'The first act of justice since colonial times,' said Arbenz. In the early 1950s, with the Cold War intensifying, then Vice President Richard Nixon said, 'Arbenz is not a Guatemalan President.' Nixon called him 'a foreigner, manipulated by foreign powers.' The young President of Guatemala was soon overthrown, declared a traitor, and chased out of the country.","popularity":0.2879,"poster_path":"/bZkWPntuEZgYdbAaB0zqk2tP6JT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76975,"logo_path":null,"name":"Icarus Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1997-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Devils Don't Dream!","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1335009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacobo Árbenz","original_name":"Jacobo Árbenz","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/aPJB2OiN9UYHjo1hzyU8pXwYoLW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"605a098d70b44400544ec2e4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Winston Churchill","original_name":"Winston Churchill","popularity":0.3296,"profile_path":"/tpxNemRAcaRckG7kkPk5oRwKTim.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"605a0997fd4f800029726cc7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Nixon","original_name":"Richard Nixon","popularity":0.3787,"profile_path":"/uCJeC6LXnv3KVA1YUNTpBh8uAhC.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"605a099ed37197002bb81d3d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1370707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"E.
