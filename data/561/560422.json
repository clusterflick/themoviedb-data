Larry Williams demonstrates the traditional method of making a pair of hollows and rounds from a solid billet, including blade making, hardening and tempering. Hollows and rounds are used in combination to make complex moldings. This unique work is interesting both as a historical record of hand tool making, as well as a guide for those who wish to make their own molding planes for use.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/itvIojiTUQmNJvFHofgMBgLAiwv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111033,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lie-Nielsen Toolworks, Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":183,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Making Traditional Side Escapement Planes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ns6znt0o3QB23wTDQpGJn6o0pzl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/itvIojiTUQmNJvFHofgMBgLAiwv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
