In the election's aftermath, an unforeseeable blow threatens the foundation of the movement they started, and the community finds their newfound optimism tested to its limit. Father K must face the realities of what it takes to build lasting power in a divided America, but through it all, his voice emerges as funny, bold, and defiantly hopeful - a bridge-builder in a polarized time.","popularity":0.0776,"poster_path":"/lXlW8hUr81LG4mR71acxMBuKZz2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Father K","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937659,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Judd Ehrlich","original_name":"Judd Ehrlich","popularity":0.073,"profile_path":"/tvsGfEgvwy3N0a87g4lw29YLozn.jpg","credit_id":"5be76d6c92514143e601a306","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937659,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Judd Ehrlich","original_name":"Judd Ehrlich","popularity":0.073,"profile_path":"/tvsGfEgvwy3N0a87g4lw29YLozn.jpg","credit_id":"67d7697231538de608f1c359","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8579042","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lXlW8hUr81LG4mR71acxMBuKZz2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1365}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Rhode Island International Film Festival","release_date":"2018-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
