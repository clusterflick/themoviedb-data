Having enjoyed a conventionally successful early career, Klimt's art changed radically in his mid-thirties. He became leader of the Vienna Secession, a group of avant-garde artists who would change the conservative Viennese art scene forever. KlimtÂ¹s own work became increasingly erotic in nature. His deeply sensual portraits of Viennese women still make a powerful impression upon the modern viewer.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/rDjkG6slsqnb3arqJytiOcJYJTA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Post-Impressionists: Klimt","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1020562","wikidata_id":"Q3430602","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rDjkG6slsqnb3arqJytiOcJYJTA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
