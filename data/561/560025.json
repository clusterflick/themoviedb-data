The story is told by four student leaders at Wits University and their Vice Chancellor, Adam Habib, a left-wing, former anti-apartheid student activist. When Habib’s efforts to contain the protest fail, he brings 1000 police on to campus. There are dire consequences for the young leaders. By blending dramatic unfolding action with a multi-protagonist narrative, much of the drama lies in the internal struggles the activists have around the weight of leadership. Threaded through the film is a pulse of anticipation, shared across the generational divide, that somehow these youth have reached breaking point and won’t back down until they achieve the kind of social transformation that previous generations had long given up on.","popularity":0.0999,"poster_path":"/t9nS9S03iMH80rGWrXlt6k2GVlp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95563,"logo_path":null,"name":"Uhuru Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2018-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The high cost of free Education","title":"Everything Must Fall","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1332465,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rehad Desai","original_name":"Rehad Desai","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/31O7nQasijGPtgpvPCFC0hFeieW.jpg","credit_id":"5be314589251415c69016768","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1332465,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rehad Desai","original_name":"Rehad Desai","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/31O7nQasijGPtgpvPCFC0hFeieW.jpg","credit_id":"5be314e90e0a2614ae016b39","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2170539,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nic Hofmeyr","original_name":"Nic Hofmeyr","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be3158ec3a36810c401750d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13085,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Megan Gill","original_name":"Megan Gill","popularity":0.0956,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be315c1c3a36810bd016753","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2170535,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zivia Desai Keiper","original_name":"Zivia Desai Keiper","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be3150cc3a36810c4017497","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1951932,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arya Lalloo","original_name":"Arya Lalloo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be315d5c3a36810c4017559","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2170542,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Geert Veuskens","original_name":"Geert Veuskens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be315e9c3a36810bf017b4c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2170545,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jannous Aukema","original_name":"Jannous Aukema","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be316259251415c6b0160d3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1332466,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anita Khanna","original_name":"Anita Khanna","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d13d2c3602026906815514","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.718,"height":1504,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t9nS9S03iMH80rGWrXlt6k2GVlp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Everything Must Fall - Documentary Trailer 2018","key":"OpGYyCLb9xQ","published_at":"2018-09-26T12:07:54.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5be316830e0a2614bf017190"}]}}}
