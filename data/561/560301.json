Hundreds of thousands of German civilians are killed as incendiary bombs turn the center of cities like Hamburg and Dresden into tornados of fire. Sixty years later, a new debate is underway over the reasons for this lethal bombing campaign. Were these relentless aerial attacks on German cities, which killed so many and destroyed so much, a necessary tactic in the war against Hitler? Or was it an act of revenge by the British and Americans? Using rare film footage (much of it in color) and stirring interviews with historians, former bomber pilots and survivors of the destruction, this extraordinary film brings to light the devastating allied air campaign against Nazi Germany.","popularity":0.254,"poster_path":"/28PDHD38tUTLsuBJ1D0VEbKDkwX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Firestorm","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Degen","original_name":"Michael Degen","popularity":0.1168,"profile_path":"/rBPILcDklbLmNwNlnZDFguiYAV7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ce50163c3a368451124910c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Kloft","original_name":"Michael Kloft","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/4XqmLKkL32mNE0Iq60jSZ1p4YM3.jpg","credit_id":"5be43aa29251415c7202b869","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0472781","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":730,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mGCQlRBlBLVqApk9cWaBSg75ew6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1300}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/28PDHD38tUTLsuBJ1D0VEbKDkwX.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1590,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/sBmjqVGHgqIvfGNRexE9bKCVO6a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1060}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2003-02-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
