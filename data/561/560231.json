To avoid scandal, his granddaughter Marie Varescot convinces Frank, his cousin, to take responsibility for this \"accidental\" death, he who is in love with Caroline. But Commissioner Legrand, who has designs on Marie, only agrees to close the affair if Marie marries her, and if Frank leaves with Caroline, abandoning his share of the inheritance. The arrangement is accepted and life goes on.","popularity":0.3339,"poster_path":"/etHfnmMwqSIN3Vhrlq3hgorfZNA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1951-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nocturnal Uproar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simone Renant","original_name":"Simone Renant","popularity":0.1583,"profile_path":"/uCFsiPGebOk3DhL61XXE6ejbnkn.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Marie Varescot","credit_id":"6213cdecd3d3870042792c2d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Rouleau","original_name":"Raymond Rouleau","popularity":0.1256,"profile_path":"/aZEHDDXKKt54D6w7Qco20hhUGhE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Commissioner Legrand","credit_id":"6213cdf041465c006c663416","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39152,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yves Vincent","original_name":"Yves Vincent","popularity":0.094,"profile_path":"/fV1IYWhCU7gdhvdIx5AqigL9dkk.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Frank Varescot","credit_id":"6213cdfc1a3248001c49b962","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucien Baroux","original_name":"Lucien Baroux","popularity":0.133,"profile_path":"/blftA0eD70wfOY9kYZLV5beixBs.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Armand Varescot","credit_id":"6213ce0041465c0044bf9a1f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Brochard","original_name":"Jean Brochard","popularity":0.0923,"profile_path":"/sohF1knzsGvrFw3RLUxRc7qIHlk.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Frédéric Varescot","credit_id":"6213ce0b0bb0760043fd77cf","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":45477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Élina Labourdette","original_name":"Élina Labourdette","popularity":0.1258,"profile_path":"/3CfRBfZTz90ZXEM8LHLiEDhJwK1.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Caroline, the secretary","credit_id":"6213ce0f6e3deb001b6dbf24","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":26363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mona Dol","original_name":"Mona Dol","popularity":0.0607,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Gertrude Varescot","credit_id":"6213ce1c4284ea0068bb94aa","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":579054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Girard","original_name":"Raymond Girard","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Me Gilbert Sauvin","credit_id":"6213ce2044a4240046cfe3b3","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":586741,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denise Clair","original_name":"Denise Clair","popularity":0.1156,"profile_path":"/wax57vrh3kEU0q6CDM8h56TKA4i.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Sylvie Sauvin, born Varescot","credit_id":"6213ce2e20e6a50042c206b1","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":144743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suzanne Grey","original_name":"Suzanne Grey","popularity":0.0928,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Estelle, the maid","credit_id":"6213ce331a3248001c49b9dd","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1130613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Simonet","original_name":"Eva Simonet","popularity":0.1084,"profile_path":"/zucIcAaoG42PX9HPiMDdk5AtZf9.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Little Isabelle","credit_id":"6213ce3f383df20042439df9","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":582139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Odette Barencey","original_name":"Odette Barencey","popularity":0.0782,"profile_path":"/gTi17nIKhDXK7LtCo3ieGIPSMNl.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Cleaning lady","credit_id":"6213ce436e3deb004218e2b9","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":144740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacqueline Noëlle","original_name":"Jacqueline Noëlle","popularity":0.169,"profile_path":"/1BsnYaWEmH488J9vDhgzfRNqwZw.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Barmaid","credit_id":"6213ce4c4284ea0040d96bd2","order":12}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1531950,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marc-Gilbert Sauvajon","original_name":"Marc-Gilbert Sauvajon","popularity":0.0744,"profile_path":"/46rBFcKFihziTKsZJkWCUNX5l8z.jpg","credit_id":"5be3dc3c0e0a2614b3025d67","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0141884","wikidata_id":"Q17494059","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/etHfnmMwqSIN3Vhrlq3hgorfZNA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1951-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
