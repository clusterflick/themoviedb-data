The villagers believe that if the Patron saint is pleased, the town will be able to end their years of mourning. The four villagers overcome many problems to organize a brilliant celebration, which will conclude with the symbolic burial of all the missing relatives. However, when one of the four has a terrible accident, they take this as a bad omen and a sign that the patron saint may not want to calm their sorrows at all.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/goUFO75DLBCAbpzhKuuIOwmGr8U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"}],"release_date":"2018-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Quechua","iso_639_1":"qu","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mataindios","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1251682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Solano","original_name":"Carlos Solano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"60f942073103250072a9df13","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3167342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nataly Aures","original_name":"Nataly Aures","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"60f94228960331004725b547","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3167345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glicerio Reynoso","original_name":"Glicerio Reynoso","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"60f9424cf056d500756c5208","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3167347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elmer Vivas","original_name":"Elmer Vivas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"60f94262e24b930048ef4183","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3167349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Faustina Sanchez","original_name":"Faustina Sanchez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"60f94272f1759c004667d46d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2173093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oscar Sánchez","original_name":"Oscar Sánchez","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f942b9f056d5005e709565","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2173094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Julca","original_name":"Robert Julca","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f942d6fd140b00463d4762","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3167357,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marco Arauco Tuesta","original_name":"Marco Arauco Tuesta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f94348960331002ea9f7aa","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3663570,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paúl Córdova","original_name":"Paul Córdova","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/dyTEoRUywcNWJVp653AcfKKITVN.jpg","credit_id":"66c11686d96f0904b62e6c27","department":"Directing","job":"First Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2173093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oscar Sánchez","original_name":"Oscar Sánchez","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be7ca53c3a36817360214e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2173094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Julca","original_name":"Robert Julca","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be7ca63c3a3681742023af1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10623116","wikidata_id":"Q123510565","facebook_id":"Mataindiosmata","instagram_id":"mataindios","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rJ94tDma3e2tWMo03O4THzEJBYU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/goUFO75DLBCAbpzhKuuIOwmGr8U.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4W3xhhZswyIkm4w8Yg8m2v89sSL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":682}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
