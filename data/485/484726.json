When a mother is imprisoned, her newborn or her young child can remain with her in prison or they can be separated and taken in by a family member or by the State. These situations aren't without risk for the child. The film takes the child's point of view and its goal is to cast a light on them: too often they are forgotten, invisible and bare scars for their entire life. The filmmaker follows the daily lives of some of these kids in Bolivia, Nepal, New York and Montreal.","popularity":0.1081,"poster_path":"/rR4Vt5ICmZOavXsFp2BijkugpR8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5032,"logo_path":null,"name":"Catpics Co Productions AG","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":280,"logo_path":"/1rwkrpgsc0pWmkvEOabbPzEsGLi.png","name":"Cinémaginaire","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":42145,"logo_path":"/fX8uY3tXWh814PLVqKM0IJEoDPW.png","name":"SRF","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2017-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Double Sentence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Double Sentence","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":135534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Léa Pool","original_name":"Léa Pool","popularity":0.0958,"profile_path":"/fHnvRHq5JuPwn3MtrTnCvoMVnJ5.jpg","credit_id":"59faf7c7c3a3681a6400c189","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":135534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Léa Pool","original_name":"Léa Pool","popularity":0.0958,"profile_path":"/fHnvRHq5JuPwn3MtrTnCvoMVnJ5.jpg","credit_id":"59faf7be92514113dd00c3a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5805028","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rR4Vt5ICmZOavXsFp2BijkugpR8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":708}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
