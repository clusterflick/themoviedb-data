His wife certainly had a hand in it. A few years back she disappeared from his life without trace, without explanation. Shortly before he was admitted to hospital she reappeared at his medical practice, accompanied by a child he wished was his own.  In his waking dreams, realities and memories of his hopes and dreams blend with dreams of realities without hopes.","popularity":0.1033,"poster_path":"/wNUYB3tQqKZUnCB0iJApMO4QaoD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2017-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elysium Hernalsiense","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1915297,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bernhard Kammel","original_name":"Bernhard Kammel","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/yzyHAj2srFbMD5WGl7us5MavzQv.jpg","credit_id":"59f8d6b0c3a3682d7b0035e1","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1915297,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bernhard Kammel","original_name":"Bernhard Kammel","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/yzyHAj2srFbMD5WGl7us5MavzQv.jpg","credit_id":"59f8d6849251414c3100302a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1915297,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bernhard Kammel","original_name":"Bernhard Kammel","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/yzyHAj2srFbMD5WGl7us5MavzQv.jpg","credit_id":"59f8d696c3a3682d50003072","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1915297,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bernhard Kammel","original_name":"Bernhard Kammel","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/yzyHAj2srFbMD5WGl7us5MavzQv.jpg","credit_id":"59f8d6749251414bf3002f1f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1915297,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bernhard Kammel","original_name":"Bernhard Kammel","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/yzyHAj2srFbMD5WGl7us5MavzQv.jpg","credit_id":"59f8d65d9251414c31002fed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1915297,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bernhard Kammel","original_name":"Bernhard Kammel","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/yzyHAj2srFbMD5WGl7us5MavzQv.jpg","credit_id":"59f8d6a3c3a3682d17003064","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2096599,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Rudolf Czettel","original_name":"Rudolf Czettel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b6080ebc3a368584201239f","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6811326","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":792,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qKTZ5lHzwYF5OvJcxDYGcAqbfzb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1408}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wNUYB3tQqKZUnCB0iJApMO4QaoD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Warsaw Film Festival","release_date":"2017-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
