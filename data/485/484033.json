A ‘Plas Newydd’ drama with a (tenous) 007 connection - it was scripted by travel writer Peter Fleming, brother of James Bond creator Ian Fleming! A detective posing as a footman infiltrates the ‘Pink Shirts’ (satirising Britain’s Blackshirts) and plots their downfall. They must have had a ball, the family, friends and staff of the 6th Marquis of Anglesey, pretending to be fascists (waders came in useful here) or defenders of democracy armed with a catapult and drawing pins.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1936-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pink Shirts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1936-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
