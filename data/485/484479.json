No plot synopsis, cast list or trailer was issued. The only image released was the teaser poster. Subsequent to the screening, director Pat Higgins physically destroyed both the master copy and the only back-up live on the stage, effectively destroying that version of the film.  Higgins made a new version of the film available to rent through Vimeo On Demand--for only one day-- on Halloween 2017.","popularity":0.1418,"poster_path":"/6w7CkjhxG3njQ4k9isoWMzQPLrP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":57720,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jinx Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The House on the Witchpit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1915464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melissa Coyne","original_name":"Melissa Coyne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Toni/Tonya","credit_id":"59f9415f9251414c3500a474","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cy Henty","original_name":"Cy Henty","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/yKWwIzdUkTemcsJkouGMw6m1mpB.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"John Canning","credit_id":"59f941709251414c2300a338","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1915465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liza Keast","original_name":"Liza Keast","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Rebecca Woods","credit_id":"59f9417c9251414c2300a357","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1915466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Reddihough","original_name":"Mike Reddihough","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Damon Reid","credit_id":"59f94194c3a3682d3d00a7c7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1915467,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Les Cannon","original_name":"Les Cannon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Ralph Horton","credit_id":"59f9419e9251414c0700a4fb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1044746,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pat Higgins","original_name":"Pat Higgins","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"James Trick","credit_id":"59f941a89251414c0700a505","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1915468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melany Dantes","original_name":"Melany Dantes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Callie","credit_id":"59f941b09251414c2900a4d9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1915225,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Paul Cousins","original_name":"Paul Cousins","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Fletcher","credit_id":"59f941bac3a3682dd700a38e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1915469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Sweeney","original_name":"Tony Sweeney","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Harry","credit_id":"59f941c2c3a3682dc8009e2c","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1915470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Mortimer","original_name":"Ken Mortimer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Lanky 414","credit_id":"59f941cb9251414c31009ea7","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1915225,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Paul Cousins","original_name":"Paul Cousins","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f8bed4c3a3682d170010d1","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1044746,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pat Higgins","original_name":"Pat Higgins","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f8bebd9251414bd50010c7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1044746,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pat Higgins","original_name":"Pat Higgins","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f8beabc3a3682dc800109a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1915226,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Phil Sheldon","original_name":"Phil Sheldon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f8beedc3a3682d5d0010b4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6880600","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6w7CkjhxG3njQ4k9isoWMzQPLrP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":706}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
