After the games, with professional opportunities limited, Steve retired from the sport to return to dairy farming to provide for his young family. He was 26 and in physiological terms, only really just arriving at his peak.  However, the desire to compete never left him and at 50, Steve made a comeback of sorts. Within a season he was one of the best on the country for any age. Our film tracks his life, his comeback and his journey to the ultimate proving ground, the UCI World masters Championships in Slovenia. Steve is a great character, and his story is one of never letting go of a dream.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":"/fd3v2OGFYo4LM7SY1guc0ph2t0K.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2015-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Unfinished business","title":"Fairless","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1863374,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcus Cobbledick","original_name":"Marcus Cobbledick","popularity":0.0553,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f90f4fc3a3682dc800649c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4774890","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fd3v2OGFYo4LM7SY1guc0ph2t0K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":180491,"name":"cycling"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
