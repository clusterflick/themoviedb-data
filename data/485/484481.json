Willie Nelson may have done the original Austin City Limits pilot show, but \"The Wheel\" was the first act to perform on the first episode of the very first season in 1976. Over three decades later they still deliver their own special brand of jazz-inspired Western Swing to avid fans of every description coast-to-coast. The other half of the very first show also featured a historic reunion of the original members of Bob Wills Texas Playboys. What makes this particular program, recorded October 14, 1992, so special is that several of those original Playboys return to perform with Asleep at the Wheel. Pioneering electric guitarist Eldon Shamblin, singer Leon Rausch, pedal steel player Herb Remington and virtuoso fiddler Johnny Gimble wail away on such Wills' classics as \"Corine, Corina,\" \"Roly Poly,\" and \"Blues for Dixie.\" Goosebumps are guaranteed.","popularity":0.091,"poster_path":"/t0AnkldIMqLNlbp9L5Zpkkr4iFL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28897,"logo_path":null,"name":"New West
