So her recent daily routine was to walk around town searching for materials that may be suitable for the plan. One day she runs into a sake barrel stacked in a shrine in Kagurazaka (Shinjuku District, Tokyo), and she finds herself immediately interested in sake and it’s history with the Kagurazaka area. She decides to do a research, and calls photographer and long time friend Ikeda (Yota Kawase), and starts her quest for the secret of the fascinating sake and the historical town. For Etsuko, who had been stressed out by her busy work, her idea of gathering interesting informations and meeting people for her job turned out becoming an exciting journey which eventually leads Etsuko to reconcile with her peaceful heart and mind, which had always been her nature.","popularity":0.1934,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2017-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Story About Kagurazaka and Sake","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":18054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rinko Kikuchi","original_name":"菊地凛子","popularity":1.221,"profile_path":"/n1GSGFdpoiDXT3ozZflsmcJy21Y.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Etsuko","credit_id":"59fcc711c3a3681a8303053e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1078683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yohta Kawase","original_name":"川瀬陽太","popularity":0.6479,"profile_path":"/aPjf57B380k929h2OZ6FT0RLS4w.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ikeda","credit_id":"59fcc740c3a3681acd032679","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1496600,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takeo Kikuchi","original_name":"菊地健雄","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/4uycjoyhHJrtCFwUy3HyWBVjB9K.jpg","credit_id":"59fcc785c3a3681a1b034b59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"A Story About Kagurazaka and Sake","key":"ms2se7gLQ7M","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2017-02-16T10:08:14.000Z","id":"64de0215a3b5e600acc28d7c"}]}}}
