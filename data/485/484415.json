Alongside another tormented soul, trapped in the inferno since the Middle Ages, you must locate the five elements comprising the human soul - so that you may reclaim your physical form on Earth - before your body rots away. Do you have the strength to face the hordes of hell and take the first element - The Fire - from the hands of its powerful, ancient protector? There's only one way to find out.","popularity":0.3897,"poster_path":"/5G5HaQIfIWCKnvO8siCBA7cKz2f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18418,"logo_path":"/jBFQBoj8dxi8Niofz8f4weuoS71.png","name":"Necrostorm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2017-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The
