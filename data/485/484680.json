Printed in varying colors and thicknesses ranging from 1 filament layer (.2mm) to 3 filament layers (.6mm), the resulting 1-second strips of film were threaded through a JK optical printer and photographed digitally to produce video output. Still left to do: splice them together and run them through a 16mm projector! And possibly make some attempt at printing animations or patterns into the face of the film, other than the standard MakerBot crosshatch.","popularity":0.0389,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"filament studies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1916013,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Libi Rose Striegl","original_name":"Libi Rose Striegl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59fa8994c3a3681a640055d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Antimatter Media Art Festival","release_date":"2017-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
