The bond between Labrecque and director Michel La Veaux allows us to see beyond the images and discover the smaller story hidden within the larger one. La Veaux shares with us his own love for film and the humanistic perspective from which Labrecque has used his camera to etch the great moments of Quebec’s culture and history into Quebecers’ collective memory.","popularity":0.1084,"poster_path":"/dJWQ0vduDbsEDXGzfaaTJvLyDMs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Labrecque, une caméra pour la mémoire","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1191083,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Claude Labrecque","original_name":"Jean-Claude Labrecque","popularity":0.0591,"profile_path":"/uW5lDCo5SgFle9bEQmm4J00rAN7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59f7343292514141ed035e9e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1171446,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michel La Veaux","original_name":"Michel La Veaux","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f7341c925141428203423e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7805920","wikidata_id":"Q60962867","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dJWQ0vduDbsEDXGzfaaTJvLyDMs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Festival du cinéma international en Abitibi-Témiscamingue","release_date":"2017-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
