By the time of this show, Jeff Tweedy and Jay Farrar were already not getting along well. Soon after the performance, they would both go on to create other bands, with Farrar founding Son Volt and Tweedy forming Wilco, but on that night in May 1994, there was one last grasp at combined harmony and greatness. In the video below, Tweedy and Farrar trade off on the lead vocals, with drummer Mike Heindon joining the band on the final song of the set, “Looking for a Way Out,” and also singing on the encore with Brian Henneman and the Bottle Rockets on Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “Gimme Three Steps.”","popularity":0.6439,"poster_path":"/9zhuZ1ZSLteW0NWX4ISIVL9EYwp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Uncle Tupelo: The Last Leg of the Andodyne Tour","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1199754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Farrar","original_name":"Jay Farrar","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"59fa477a925141138b000734","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Tweedy","original_name":"Jeff Tweedy","popularity":0.1682,"profile_path":"/oCkl5DHGRN5R748lzbzd7DuSR3c.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"59fa4787c3a3681adf000654","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q28NazCHAntE1J6WXv9SOCDjiqM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476},{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9zhuZ1ZSLteW0NWX4ISIVL9EYwp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":727,"name":"country music"},{"id":4470,"name":"punk rock"},{"id":162066,"name":"rock concert"},{"id":192515,"name":"garage rock"},{"id":210685,"name":"alt-country"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1994-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
