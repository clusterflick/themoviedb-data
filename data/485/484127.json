The man driving the getaway car packed up and left before anyone could connect him with the crime, and Angelo's other partner got shot and killed. The best he can do is grab someone's cash-filled briefcase and take a car and its driver hostage. It turns out that the driver is the daughter of the bank director, so he figures that she's good for ransom money and begins negotiations for that. Meanwhile, the briefcase he took at the bank turns out to have belonged to a man who is willing to hire killers to get it back for him. The situation grows increasingly perilous for him, and he decides to flee the scene but not before he has won the heart of his lovely hostage.","popularity":0.6122,"poster_path":"/gb7d6ivv56rVUWkp5dl51fVpTf3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1991-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All Out","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"De plein fouet","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dexter Fletcher","original_name":"Dexter Fletcher","popularity":0.721,"profile_path":"/yRI8MDB5sg8b8EZkzFz5cCBrnKL.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Angelo","credit_id":"59f6462b9251414257020abd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":144780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabienne Babe","original_name":"Fabienne Babe","popularity":0.1679,"profile_path":"/cOny64DetoolafEsbqinPxdTmIN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Julia","credit_id":"59f6463ec3a3682dd401fa0f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uwe Ochsenknecht","original_name":"Uwe Ochsenknecht","popularity":0.5515,"profile_path":"/mlNKDWmAxUIqLT4ZfW1REo7MoOD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Paul","credit_id":"59f6464f9251414d2003c290","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17546,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Fitz","original_name":"Peter Fitz","popularity":0.201,"profile_path":"/uuS2Tbva1PdAeMxFKUjlO1V7eJN.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Schnyder","credit_id":"5a95fb609251417b09000adc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernhard Bettermann","original_name":"Bernhard Bettermann","popularity":0.1288,"profile_path":"/iQSL2qHf3D9DFm5v4znT6PGpVSi.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bodyguard","credit_id":"5a95fb6fc3a3685a33000c53","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1270480,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Koerfer","original_name":"Thomas Koerfer","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/hKvm3UvmOIORecDu7f2y1zFvxO4.jpg","credit_id":"5a95fb4e9251417b15000afc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0101303","wikidata_id":"Q63721398","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.749,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gb7d6ivv56rVUWkp5dl51fVpTf3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":749}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
