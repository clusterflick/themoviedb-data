In the process, they hope to help both themselves and the people they love find, once again, the poignant, joyful harmony in which those afloat in this fragile bowl of land have always coexisted with nature's fury ... and with the ever-present waters that at once imperil and sustain them. This \"powerful new anthem for New Orleans\" seizes viewers by the heart at the crossroads of art film, anthem for social change and pop culture music video.","popularity":0.0929,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Shall Not Be Moved New Orleans","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5411952,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Akin","original_name":"Joe Akin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6815264862a075b4db84c6bb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5411959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renee Wilson","original_name":"Renee Wilson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"681526aa3ebcc1ac0084c6d4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5411960,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Molony","original_name":"Kevin Molony","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"681526e6ee8ae870ed84c6e1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3172184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yolanda Windsay","original_name":"Yolanda Windsay","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"681527091c82f09b02030d51","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5411960,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Molony","original_name":"Kevin Molony","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68152752d849ce6260a20d8d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5411960,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Molony","original_name":"Kevin Molony","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6815275f46706f2aaf089a3a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1440376","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
