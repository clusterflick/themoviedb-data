As immigration policies and narratives around national identity continue to evolve, both in the U.S. and globally, the film offers powerful insights into how the past still echoes today. What happened in the past can happen again, and often does.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Voices of Deoli","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5412040,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lulu Men","original_name":"Lulu Men","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681532b759fc8a4b57030d8c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35470113","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival 2025","release_date":"2025-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
