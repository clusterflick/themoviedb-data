But things get worse—fast—when Marcus, fresh out of jail, pressures his younger brother Alex into robbing the same event to prove he's not soft.  With one venue, two plans, and zero coordination, what starts as a revenge-fueled robbery turns into a ridiculous, high-stakes collision of egos, emotions, and terrible decision-making. Couch Potatoes is a slapstick crime comedy about friendship, pride, and how not to plan a heist.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"Two crews.
