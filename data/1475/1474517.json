The images are mostly shot candidly as commonly seen on social media: some really close up while others set further back, enough to show family members sharing a meal. The title and the tone in the voiceover imply a longing for those foods and of familial/cultural belonging, while also re-framing those intimate moments and family dynamics at the dinner table as parts of larger concerns. The viewer is essentially taken on a journey re-thinking the concept of “family dinner” or “dinner at a table” as a communal/sacred tradition and acknowledging how the foods we eat, as ordinary as they may seem, are layered with histories, cultures, and politics of their own.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/gri94cd6ZQSiUV5zS5WjFotCHEP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dinner as I Remember","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5412036,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francis Almendárez","original_name":"Francis Almendárez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6815328394eb973c9bbe8f04","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gri94cd6ZQSiUV5zS5WjFotCHEP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
