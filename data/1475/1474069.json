Beneath the playful absurdity lies a scathing reflection on media exploitation, personal betrayal, and the emotional toll of being transformed into a spectacle. Through bizarre imagery, metaphorical architecture, and layered visual storytelling, Leave Me Alone confronts the dehumanization of fame and the slow erosion of dignity under the weight of false narratives. As fantasy collides with emotional truth, the film offers both a cry of defiance and a quiet affirmation of self-worth reclaimed.","popularity":0.1668,"poster_path":"/q50mQ9iYtpMmgvfOWCZ9CeTMVSw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14405,"logo_path":"/e4HEWHodBJVEZr6YpgiSaStMMJR.png","name":"MJJ Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":19222,"logo_path":null,"name":"Optimum Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Just stop doggin' me around","title":"Leave Me Alone","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/snQHyHmB8S4JLIkmeEjQivGMdms.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":8.558,"height":120,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jKV58hWinjWTpT3QtW7FTdTMWnC.png","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1027},{"aspect_ratio":0.174,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sDIftWK5HFTYmodXc2iiVGBfDIX.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":523}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/q50mQ9iYtpMmgvfOWCZ9CeTMVSw.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/d1BFwRer30yEb9jO9vZjnFjUn3L.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/v6DXnNSqJrLRGFzZdIzBDRgDx5r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/51M26WRVmO0mPkLaCnQwJwNgRGB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":227426,"name":"media criticism"},{"id":337468,"name":"stop motion animation"},{"id":349280,"name":"michael jackson"},{"id":351304,"name":"elephant man"}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
