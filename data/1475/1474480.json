While many are gutting houses, others are sewing together beaded suits. While some are decorating streets, others are removing debris from them. While some await insurance money, others just bought their ball tickets. But everybody, whether rich or poor, old or young, black or white, local or tourist... can feel a buzz in the air! Ours is a story of hope and despair, of destruction and renewal, of merriment and grief: For how does one revel amongst ruins? How does mourning become celebration? Who's waving for beads and who's crying for help? This is the season of Carnival, The Season Before Spring.","popularity":0.0929,"poster_path":"/8IVXsTc9IN0thZguDXlheGRRXTp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Mardi Gras 2006 in post-Katrina New Orleans","title":"Season Before Spring movie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":778,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8IVXsTc9IN0thZguDXlheGRRXTp.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":519},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":778,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l0woVhYTlUonQYNdY7LrDn1gBtB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":519}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
