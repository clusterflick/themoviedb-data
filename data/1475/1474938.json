In her path she encounters grassroots organizations like Common Ground and Soul Patrol that were formed in response to the government's failure to manage evacuation and relief efforts before, during and after the hurricane. She also finds Camp Amtrak, a makeshift jail and court room at an old bus station where inmates are sentenced to community service. Finally, she meets people in neighboring towns that are still waiting for FEMA to pays them a visit. Through interviews with residents, activists and city officials, Imarisha succinctly captures the pain, loss and hope of the people of New Orleans.","popularity":0.1929,"poster_path":"/bmN2Ec5OIxRCX5gCfRynPOkd9I5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Addresses the social injustices that took place during and after the hurricane Katrina disaster through the lens of poet and activist Walidah Imarisha.","title":"Finding Common Ground in New Orleans","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5413572,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walidah Imarisha","original_name":"Walidah Imarisha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"68165566bdbd1ec811089d90","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5413572,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walidah Imarisha","original_name":"Walidah Imarisha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6816553d8f4921c6f5a21173","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bmN2Ec5OIxRCX5gCfRynPOkd9I5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":733}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
