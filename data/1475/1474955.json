It was there that one of the biggest upsets in the history of soccer happened, England's defeat to the USA in 1950. A match in which the English believed they had already won, even before playing. The same thing happened with Brazil, in the sad match against Uruguay, which resulted in the \"Maracanazo\". In BH, 64 years later, an unprepared team believes it can beat Germany. Unprecedented scenes of a group of fans echo the perplexity that crossed the country during the 7-1 defeat of the Germans over the Brazilians, which led to the \"Mineirazo\".","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/yoYfW8aDTcYvl1SvS4g2ADcHL4T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161929,"logo_path":"/qbodYjIoPxGRMZtyu7QGGOnWkQ.png","name":"SporTV","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":17415,"logo_path":null,"name":"Casa de Cinema de Porto Alegre","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2014-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guerra de Gigantes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2755967,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jonatas Rubert","original_name":"Jonatas Rubert","popularity":0.0402,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68165ee219ceb3248df4816c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2157694,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Maurício Nader","original_name":"Maurício Nader","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68165eed8f4921c6f5a211a0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1439943,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Beto Magalhães","original_name":"Beto Magalhães","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68165efab1b78cc416076dc1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5413667,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Flávia Salles","original_name":"Anna Flávia Salles","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68165f0646c5e0c804908374","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yoYfW8aDTcYvl1SvS4g2ADcHL4T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
