Sixteen people, seven dogs, and eight cats took shelter in Tim’s loft in an old dairy in New Orleans. When the force of Hurricane Katrina breached the levees, they found themselves surrounded by eight feet of water. With a clear view of people stranded on the elevated I-10 for days—and access to news reports of the dire circumstances unfolding at the Superdome—they have to find a way to survive. A wry sociological study of group behavior as Tim’s houseguests cope with survival.","popularity":0.0929,"poster_path":"/jn5O4qg6LwvPhq24OmvP5DXRNf2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":261192,"logo_path":null,"name":"Two Feet of Grace","origin_country":""},{"id":260827,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ghost Rider Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Power of Culture to Heal","title":"Tim's Island","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5411294,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laszlo Fulop","original_name":"Laszlo Fulop","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68162a7eb58050ea368b5fb3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5413257,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wickes Helmboldt","original_name":"Wickes Helmboldt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68162a93b58050ea368b5fbe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5411294,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laszlo Fulop","original_name":"Laszlo Fulop","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68162aa50d356ee5cc0312c2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5413257,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wickes Helmboldt","original_name":"Wickes Helmboldt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68162ab15f9ca5ac99a210c8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jn5O4qg6LwvPhq24OmvP5DXRNf2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1058}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
