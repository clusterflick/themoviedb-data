Known today as 'Pfeifer Hans', he was burned as a heretic by the bishop in the 15th century after preaching a new kingdom of God without an emperor and pope to hundreds of convinced peasants. While preparations for the play are underway, conversations with the villagers show how much this past still moves them today.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":261140,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alfred Jungraithmayr Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1982-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Pfeifer von Niklashausen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3407222,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alfred Jungraithmayr","original_name":"Alfred Jungraithmayr","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6815e586f2baa68a4e907ea7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3407222,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alfred Jungraithmayr","original_name":"Alfred Jungraithmayr","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6815e58de14a825cc68b5dfb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1734924,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lew Hohmann","original_name":"Lew Hohmann","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6815e5b9f8cb7fc833959316","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0425351","wikidata_id":"Q106717209","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Filmwoche Duisburg","release_date":"1982-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
