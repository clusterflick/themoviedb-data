Schneerson, of righteous memory, the Chabad Lubavitch Shluchim emissaries are legendary for their love of every Jew. Join Chabad rabbis in Thailand as they search hospitals for missing Jews after the tsunami; enter post-Katrina New Orleans together with search and rescue teams; and accompany volunteers as they bring meals to home-bound seniors in the wake of Hurricane Wilma. The locations and circumstances vary, but the instinctive response is the same. Through their actions, the Shluchim show that we really are One. Several short talks by the Rebbe on Ahavas Yisroel, love for one s fellow, are presented throughout the film.","popularity":0.1,"poster_path":"/zibmdL36QEQjdUNKh1sDNl7dMAS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":261222,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jewish Educational Media JEM","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Chabad's rescue and relief efforts in the wake of several natural disasters","title":"One: Chabad's Rescue And Relief Efforts in Wake of Several Natural Disasters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5413532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chabad Shluchim","original_name":"Chabad Shluchim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"681650dc3cf2bab098f48097","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5413533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rabbi Menachem M.
