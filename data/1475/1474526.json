This work examines the notion of \"productivity\" and how the meaning of that word changes depending on how the body is racialized or gendered, and what task that body is performing. Numerous video portraits of both family and community members performing various tasks of labor are placed side by side, prompting the questions: what bodies are afforded leisure?, and is it possible to reclaim ownership of one's own body? There is no dialogue but instead a visual and aural tour of working-class labor that speeds up to follow a transition from the countryside to the city.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ahpWisQmI3xyka7ngjqb4Rz7uNs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"rhythm and (p)leisure","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5412036,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francis Almendárez","original_name":"Francis Almendárez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681534ade97f9122b9959199","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ahpWisQmI3xyka7ngjqb4Rz7uNs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"@ Artpace in San Antonio, Texas","release_date":"2019-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
