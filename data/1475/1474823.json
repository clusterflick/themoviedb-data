It aims to shed light on a white spot of the 20th century: how Hungary sheltered the Bavarian royal family from fascism and enriched the almost 1,000 years of Bavarian-Hungarian historical relations. The Wittelsbach dynasty, which had dominated the political and cultural life of Bavaria for 800 years, confronted Hitler during the years of National Socialism. Part of the family fled to Italy and part to Hungary. The documentary shows the life of the members of the royal family in Hungary and their close ties to Hungarian culture.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The stud-farmer of Sárvár","title":"The stud farm of Sárvár","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5413124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ludwig von Bayern","original_name":"Ludwig von Bayern","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Ludwig von Bayern","credit_id":"68161d49ae3fd4edaf84cb07","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5413125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luitpold von Bayern","original_name":"Luitpold von Bayern","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Luitpold von Bayern","credit_id":"68161d756ea216a5e984cb69","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5413127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rasso von Bayern","original_name":"Rasso von Bayern","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Rasso von Bayern","credit_id":"68161d97f26c89b8d684cac7","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1085750,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Katalin Petényi","original_name":"Katalin Petényi","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68161bac74b821f765089d14","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125406,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barna Kabay","original_name":"Barna Kabay","popularity":0.168,"profile_path":"/f47zp6TCuqsIPswO0YHKvt65P96.jpg","credit_id":"68161bf4cd487d6189089e5f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1085750,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Katalin Petényi","original_name":"Katalin Petényi","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68161cca0b34549c5d8b5f54","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125406,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barna Kabay","original_name":"Barna Kabay","popularity":0.168,"profile_path":"/f47zp6TCuqsIPswO0YHKvt65P96.jpg","credit_id":"68161cf9935121f9328b5ea9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037799,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Zsolt Tóth","original_name":"Zsolt Tóth","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68161de56ea216a5e984cb6e","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1460892,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Péter Jankura","original_name":"Péter Jankura","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68161e16b85865d98a8b5f18","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
