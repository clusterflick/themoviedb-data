It is the story of two granddaughters, Keira Loughran and Helen Lee, who set out to examine the legacy of their grandmothers – women who fought for reunification of Chinese Canadian families and helped pave the way for Canada’s policy of multiculturalism. Spoken English and Chinese with English and Chinese subtitles. It’s an extraordinary untold story which serves as a timely reminder of the struggle, sacrifice and the contribution made by countless Chinese Canadians to the fabric of this country.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/j35TrPjw0w6ZGTLRKzMbAKaQf2q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Exclusion: Beyond the Silence","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"百年沉默","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5412503,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Lee","original_name":"Helen Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"681594701f3b8f5003959331","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2302330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keira Loughran","original_name":"Keira Loughran","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"681594802a19eccf4e9592aa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5412504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Lumb","original_name":"Jean Lumb","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6815948aa5522004f5a20eab","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2302330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keira Loughran","original_name":"Keira Loughran","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681590635ae2f3b8b98b5d3d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34622683","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":769,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/j35TrPjw0w6ZGTLRKzMbAKaQf2q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":513}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"第二届海丝纪录片大会","release_date":"2025-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"“Exclusion: Beyond the Silence” Panel Talk [B.C.
