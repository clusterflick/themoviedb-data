The program follows Janie-Rice Brother, Principal Scholar and Architectural Historian, as she documents life in the Creelsboro Rural Historic District, which extends from Wolf Creek Dam to Rockhouse Natural Bridge in south-central Kentucky. At the beginning of her research, Ms. Brother states, “I hope to learn not only about the history of the rural historic district, but what patterns emerge throughout that history and what people value about their roots and their stories in this river valley, and what they would like the rest of the world to know.”","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4JQPqPw6ekjsX27DA9owDrE5mCf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Creelsboro and the Cumberland: A Living History","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4JQPqPw6ekjsX27DA9owDrE5mCf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
