Jacob is trying to adapt to his new life in sleepy suburbia having followed his partner, Aisling, there for her new job. While she is occupied and happily settling into her new life, Jacob is struggling to adjust, stuck in an open prison that is their 'fixer-upper' house, unsuccessfully looking for work while trying to keep the persistent drip from the ceiling from falling into his cheerios. Jacob's deterioration continues further with the delivery of a newspaper by a paper boy, containing a cry for help. The boy, his red bike, uncatchable despite Jacobs attempts, unsettles Jacob and with further investigation within the neighbourhood, no trace of this kid seems to exist.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4yO5DXbvKzR61iDBY4hJArp4i5I.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":262486,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lab 91","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paper Boy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2302365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Atherton","original_name":"James Atherton","popularity":0.5774,"profile_path":"/7FSRiKmm8UE1pDXuVqnzb2XkXAB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jacob","credit_id":"6827492711d6d7ec9d2d2d83","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3256152,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cat Kolubayev","original_name":"Cat Kolubayev","popularity":0.1128,"profile_path":"/cnmllUcFenkLOnPcb0AVzI3WWqq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Aisling","credit_id":"682749388b1e454432adaad0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3839191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charley Bartlett","original_name":"Charley Bartlett","popularity":0.1205,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Paper Boy","credit_id":"6827494f4d6c1005af768459","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":210950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Thorne","original_name":"Jane Thorne","popularity":0.9492,"profile_path":"/wZnyLVOfkIrhEsNQFADSa5bAeBw.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Neighbor","credit_id":"6827496028d65e454e76832e","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1710094,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Daniel Ward Garber","original_name":"Daniel Ward Garber","popularity":0.1297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68274909752abbbbf85a4231","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1710094,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Daniel Ward Garber","original_name":"Daniel Ward Garber","popularity":0.1297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68274a494afff0afa72d8363","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8454070","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":837,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4yO5DXbvKzR61iDBY4hJArp4i5I.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":558}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
