That fuzzy tabby escapes Greydon’s lab into the world, where it occasionally barfs out the killer cat within to deliver nasty low-budget feline death. Meanwhile, a sleazy rich criminal lures some Spring break college babes and their friends onto his yacht for a voyage. The voyage is to complete a big high-risk criminal deal, so why does he want random college partiers along for the ride? Because he likes watching girls do Jazzercise. No, really, that’s the whole reason.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RiffTrax: Uninvited","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21614640","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
