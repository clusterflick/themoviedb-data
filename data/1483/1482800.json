Carrying a holdall of narcotics and an envelope of cash, Chloe boards the last train on the London Underground, only to find herself trapped in a nightmare. A masked killer slaughters her fellow passengers in a blood-soaked frenzy, and Chloe barely escapes, fleeing into a labyrinth of tunnels. Captured by this grotesquely deformed psychopath, sheâ€™s thrown into a makeshift prison with other terrified captives. With the help of sharp-witted rapper Natter G and the resourceful Nina, she leads a desperate fight through a nightmarish maze.","popularity":0.0857,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":2395,"logo_path":"/pZz4qs03FtP6UGtZ3hjQ6qimcwi.png","name":"HanWay Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":1854,"logo_path":"/3p1fIgAgsULm8wBTCTGk2mqh6yT.png","name":"Dan Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":31112,"logo_path":null,"name":"Newscope Films","origin_country":""},{"id":247156,"logo_path":null,"name":"True Brit Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"The Creep","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1577903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jasmine Jobson","original_name":"Jasmine Jobson","popularity":0.7202,"profile_path":"/3nPjCQdAUofg6qlfWomTVPaFLEu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Chloe","credit_id":"6828b43df43368e0f5e24723","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22810,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Nyman","original_name":"Andy Nyman","popularity":2.3185,"profile_path":"/9bN9RVoPWmsmV3VBI7hp4VKD9Kg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dave","credit_id":"6828b4504b404174342f6b30","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3287422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aitch","original_name":"Aitch","popularity":0.1378,"profile_path":"/q0PRDOlVcsoWMCMbEqfj0C0Rz58.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Natter G","credit_id":"6828b46146b87340b12f6ae9","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41041,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Smith","original_name":"Christopher Smith","popularity":1.9439,"profile_path":"/7Un0sQeq7V9DgJw9n3OEzdo4vod.jpg","credit_id":"6828b4702a7ca4b1958bfe09","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41041,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Smith","original_name":"Christopher Smith","popularity":1.9439,"profile_path":"/7Un0sQeq7V9DgJw9n3OEzdo4vod.jpg","credit_id":"6828b47c46b87340b12f6aef","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":56020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julie Baines","original_name":"Julie Baines","popularity":0.3519,"profile_path":"/fmE7dOEcM2rCvSzVOzUWCNBhp2L.jpg","credit_id":"6828b48d6b3fe3073d2f6b47","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41845,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jason Newmark","original_name":"Jason Newmark","popularity":0.6606,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6828b49ae19cab56120bcf0a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69883,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peter Watson","original_name":"Peter Watson","popularity":1.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6828b4aa846aa0a86cdb21fc","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2320640,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marie-Gabrielle Stewart","original_name":"Marie-Gabrielle Stewart","popularity":0.4428,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6828b4c75af708fe099e2d63","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6226,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zygi Kamasa","original_name":"Zygi Kamasa","popularity":1.5198,"profile_path":"/fOIHGCwhlbGHVIMj5lwzQDtm7lE.jpg","credit_id":"6828b4dceaeb5360bcdb2153","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1157610,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jonathan Taylor","original_name":"Jonathan Taylor","popularity":0.2189,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6828b4f35f05a71dd42f6bf7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287466,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Laurie Cook","original_name":"Laurie Cook","popularity":0.6732,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6828b502be840adb280bcece","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41848,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"John Frankish","original_name":"John Frankish","popularity":1.415,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6828b50cf6cf2076f3e243c6","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56021,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Danny Cohen","original_name":"Danny Cohen","popularity":1.2356,"profile_path":"/j4TRM9RVYalHpuVccYV383NL4Ws.jpg","credit_id":"6828b51929b78a28ca8bfe55","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9714,"name":"remake"},{"id":317736,"name":"horror remake"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
