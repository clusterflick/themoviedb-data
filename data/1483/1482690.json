This veritable tragedy in dance tells the story of a young Scotsman who leaves his fiancée out of love for a sylph—a spirit of the air that he alone can see...  The impeccable artists of the Australian Ballet, led by Leanne Stojmenov and Daniel Gaudiello, offer a dazzling interpretation of La Sylphide, set among the sumptuous sets by Anne Fraser which beautifully complement this romantic masterpiece, whose Paris premiere in 1832 is widely thought to mark the beginning of en pointe dancing by the incredible Marie Taglioni!","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/3h61U9WQ1khm6Aal8X83VdKFEx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La
