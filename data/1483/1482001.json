It had been a long time since he indulged in his favorite pastime — traveling, something he had loved since his university days.\r One day, out of the blue, he receives a phone call from Shogo, a senior from his university, inviting him on a trip to Okutama. Though puzzled by the sudden invitation, Naoya heads out to Okutama, where Shogo introduces him to an American traveler named Jackson.\r The three of them explore the lush natural surroundings — a place so rich in nature it hardly feels like it’s still part of Tokyo. Along the way, they meet warm-hearted locals and fully enjoy the natural beauty of Okutama.\r This unexpected escape from his ordinary life brings Naoya small yet meaningful realizations and changes. The scenery before his eyes begins to gently shine in a new light.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"日の出を知らない街","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
