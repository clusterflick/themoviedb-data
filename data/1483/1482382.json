Although no one by the name of Christian Bouche-Villeneuve or Sandor Krasna has - to the best of Brown's knowledge - claimed to know anything about the film, Brown will present the film to interested parties. Although the film is presumably unfinished, Brown has decided to follow what appear to be the original filmmakers' intentions and to call the project China: A User's Manual (Films).","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/lsROCAsaGNaZjdHkuOOKEJ8vTop.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":262080,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beg Steal Borrow","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"China: A User's Manual (Films)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1551845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Brown","original_name":"William Brown","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6827a9d0933e88e062e23fe1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1755,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lsROCAsaGNaZjdHkuOOKEJ8vTop.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1170}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
