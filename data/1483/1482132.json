Fascinated by the possibility of finding in Negi a spiritual guide to come to terms with death, Ben relives and shares his personal story. His journey leads him to deal with the role life has given him, closely linked to his relationship with his father. As the impossibility of finding clear and definitive answers becomes apparent, the deeply human need to accept death emerges, transcending cultural, religious, and geographical barriers.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il rospo e il diamante","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1793330,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Beniamino Casagrande","original_name":"Beniamino Casagrande","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682740dff603e29841768375","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
