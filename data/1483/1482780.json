Tchaikovsky admired the work's \"infinity of poetry\" in letters to his brother. However, while Pushkin’s verse is often sharp and satirical, Tchaikovsky’s music emphasizes the characters’ strength of feeling. Join a brilliant lineup — including Ukrainian baritone Iurii Samoilov as Onegin and soprano Kristina Mkhitaryan as Tatyana — alongside the Chorus and Orchestra of the Teatro Real, led by conductor Gustavo Gimeno, in this \"profound and intimate exploration of love, regret, and honor\" (OperaWire).","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":158,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eugene Onegin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2232379,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Javier Rubio","original_name":"Javier Rubio","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6828b0024321d6b1069e2df4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin at Madrid's Teatro Real—with Kristina Mkhitaryan","key":"kW_zIghErm8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-02-20T15:01:05.000Z","id":"6828b0133c007aa7039e2e0e"}]}}}
