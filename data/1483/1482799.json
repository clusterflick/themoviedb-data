In his new production, Rolando Villazón—the tenor who has embarked on a brilliant second career as a director—retains the opera’s original setting in the Swiss Alps but uses its somnambulant plot to explore the emotional and psychological valleys of the mind. Tenor Xabier Anduaga returns after his acclaimed 2023 Met debut in L’Elisir d’Amore, co-starring as Amina’s fiancé Elvino, alongside soprano Sydney Mancasola as her rival, Lisa, and bass Alexander Vinogradov as Count Rodolfo. Riccardo Frizza takes the podium for one of opera’s most ravishing works.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/sb1l9WdNL9RqH3KvkjuUGWASgml.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"The Metropolitan Opera: La Sonnambula","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1487288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Vinogradov","original_name":"Alexander Vinogradov","popularity":0.1708,"profile_path":"/eX0pzvAdqwiLJjSe8mmrAJLHNAu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6828b4c75af708fe099e2d66","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1568209,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Riccardo Frizza","original_name":"Riccardo Frizza","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6828b4cf2fe2fc11aa9e2d5e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5444857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sydney Mancasola","original_name":"Sydney Mancasola","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6828b4d7f5604cf01e9e2d30","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2603903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xabier Anduaga","original_name":"Xabier Anduaga","popularity":0.0697,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6828b4df5f05a71dd42f6bf3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1898098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadine Sierra","original_name":"Nadine Sierra","popularity":0.3594,"profile_path":"/ekwYV61wshIQqlcaaGg6ZL5zEMK.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6828b4eaa29c81f3e1f552e0","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sb1l9WdNL9RqH3KvkjuUGWASgml.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
