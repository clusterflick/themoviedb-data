The complex's avant-garde architecture, characterised by interconnected walkways and innovative spatial design, serves both as a backdrop and a contributor, providing dynamic spaces for the performers to interact with. Against this urban canvas, the protagonists' movements seamlessly intertwine with the geometric forms and communal areas, reflecting the complexities of human connection amidst modernist structures.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Will be After Us","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3830887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greta Grinevičiūtė","original_name":"Greta Grinevičiūtė","popularity":0.1276,"profile_path":"/btxUMZVjqqRiGTekjie7kGQPZN.jpg","credit_id":"6827226e5a0100856da18be3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
