Stravinsky's \"The Wedding\" is a vivid example of the \"rhythmic\" music characteristic of the work of the composers of the 1920s and 1930s. Rhythm in it is not only the primary organizing principle, but also the most important factor of musical language. It is characteristic that the composer here does not need either strings or wind instruments: the score of the Wedding, in addition to the voices, consists of percussion, which requires six performers at once, as well as four pianos, which are used here as a special kind of percussion.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/o7qPWYZR6X6E5oXSzKaPM85mE0y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11514,"logo_path":"/uC4LtXWXfuDleivpGYSOsl8veXN.png","name":"Royal Opera House","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Noces","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5443275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zenaida Janowski","original_name":"Zenaida Janowski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"The Bride","credit_id":"6827a0d9fdb3af9104d98456","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1582258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Pickering","original_name":"David Pickering","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":"/eAZ1U5b9hlp9rqObuSfABtFzsgW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Fiance","credit_id":"6827a13de735dc81d542f80c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2638761,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christopher Newton","original_name":"Christopher Newton","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6827a28a9d0789dfb08bfa6a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o7qPWYZR6X6E5oXSzKaPM85mE0y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
