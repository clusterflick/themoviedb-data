Desperate for relief, he volunteers for a radical treatment to escape his tortured mind. But instead of peace, he finds himself trapped in a house with a tunnel to his subconscious. What begins as a path to healing becomes a harrowing descent where memory fractures, time distorts, and reality bends. A first-of-its-kind cinematic experience, Soul to Squeeze begins in a boxy 4:3 aspect ratio and ever so slowly widens to a full 2.35:1 by the final frame-mirroring Jacob's expanding perception as he risks everything for redemption. Visually daring and emotionally raw, Soul to Squeeze merges body with mind, taking audiences on a perilous journey through the psyche.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soul to Squeeze","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18225646","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
