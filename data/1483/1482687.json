The park was donated to Cincinnati by Levi Addison Ault, who also led the first Board of Park Commissioners and developed a plan for a city-wide park system. Like Eden Park, grand architecture, breathtaking landscape and community events draw Cincinnatians to visit. The history and architecture of the park's iconic pavilion is explored, as well as monuments and other pieces of public art.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/aqQT9ow4149K3Mu3BY0VIFiqCEM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ault
