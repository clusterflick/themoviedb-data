A protracted war has resulted in a demographic crisis, so pursuant to a new law, the girl is obligated to bear children for the good of the nation. The means of encouraging women to join the ranks of childbearers is the manipulation that a nuclear war is imminent, and in the event of such a threat the state provides women with refuge in a special bunker. The news plunges the girl into a nerve-wracking premonition of disaster.
