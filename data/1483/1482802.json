In this twenty-nine hour musical work—focusing on the characters of Eve, Michael, and Lucifer—each opera corresponds to a day of the week, in turn associated with a planet. Sonntag, Day of the Sun, is the most dense and impressive score in the cycle. Premiered after the composer's death, the piece focuses on the mystical union of Eve and Michael, while exploring the concepts of space-time and the ‘spatialisation’ of sound. The brilliant staging of Le Balcon and Maxime Pascal, who also conducts the musicians of the Orchestre de Chambre de Paris, plunges us into an immersive experience where we can discover the captivating world of Karlheinz Stockhausen.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":273,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sonntag aus Licht","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
