Then, in the late 1980s, dance notation specialists Ann Hutchinson Guest and Claudia Jeschke reconstructed the ballet from Nijinsky's own notebooks, his dance notation, and the photographs of the dancers that Baron Adolph de Meyer produced shortly after the original performance of the ballet. This reconstructed version is often presented alongside Nijinsky's other works or repertoire from the Ballets Russes.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/iSZU1q1NgsWmxhGfl2bHxEXlPnk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Afternoon of a Faun","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":235882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolf Nureyev","original_name":"Rudolf Nureyev","popularity":1.0764,"profile_path":"/5bukL5Fsj1SBCdCtzfpWaUBuftu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6828f63d8a8e3de9759e2d9a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2857333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikolay Tsiskaridze","original_name":"Nikolay Tsiskaridze","popularity":0.2329,"profile_path":"/62KBqOm0WJQEt3Tc3FwzCaWiDty.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6828f658c78f4532bf2f6d04","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":238520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilse Liepa","original_name":"Ilse Liepa","popularity":0.2348,"profile_path":"/kklXDxPW7UtglVEyToPpS4klDZ2.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6828f669f0c5ed6dbd9e2e94","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2682231,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Robert Joffrey","original_name":"Robert Joffrey","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6828f6a2917f9501805b5258","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iSZU1q1NgsWmxhGfl2bHxEXlPnk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
