Impermanence and loss before death, an examination of my grief after the death of my grandfather. I’d never experienced death, but I’d experienced loss. Loss without death had been passive; I knew these people, no longer in my life, were still there, somewhere. There was very little to come to terms with. Death requires searching: is he here in photos, in voicemails, in an afterlife? The creation of this project has been a matter of processing, not just the loss of my grandfather, but understanding how my body reacts to change, whether the loss matters to me now or did in the past.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/6bcTV7ICrukknowkVoorPDeLO3E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ticking Clock, Heavy Stone\\\\Where Do I Grieve?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4479824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niall Brady","original_name":"Niall Brady","popularity":0.1835,"profile_path":"/g5BNukDdei9OWN4nPdmHNzflw1z.jpg","credit_id":"682742e38b1e454432adaaa5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4479828,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Thomas Smith","original_name":"Thomas Smith","popularity":0.0879,"profile_path":"/oPoxKjvLxZycKiqF0LWCv3Q0Hbm.jpg","credit_id":"682742f459c38675ddada88c","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4479824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niall Brady","original_name":"Niall Brady","popularity":0.1835,"profile_path":"/g5BNukDdei9OWN4nPdmHNzflw1z.jpg","credit_id":"682743079b20cff7d6768ba2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4479824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niall Brady","original_name":"Niall Brady","popularity":0.1835,"profile_path":"/g5BNukDdei9OWN4nPdmHNzflw1z.jpg","credit_id":"68274312c94058087d4b5be7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":888,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7CS3AUetb5V4MPhcvzGfXYuaKJT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1578}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6bcTV7ICrukknowkVoorPDeLO3E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
