When he moves in with his brother he soon discovers he's not the only one running from his problems. This Is Not Happening is a middle-class drama about decidedly middle-class problems, a la Joanna Hogg or Lena Dunham. When Chris returns he brings the denial of his parents' death with him, but we soon discover he's not the only one in denial. Ultimately, everyone involved must confront the issues they've been running from for years. A performance led film with a distinctive visual style. European in tone but grounded in middle class England. The film explores a group of people who try to ignore their problems, but who in the end find their problems are impossible to deny.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/mDJTv6LhWuqZGR5YY579NSWGONK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Is Not Happening","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1583054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ingvild Deila","original_name":"Ingvild Deila","popularity":0.5742,"profile_path":"/dprqeIfGxzB3zD4Rjj2OaANMSo7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Anna","credit_id":"6827909c9e6391d4565351b8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2409666,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hasan Dixon","original_name":"Hasan Dixon","popularity":0.2725,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Andrew Hill","credit_id":"682790b9b71b90400453518f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1340731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aiste S.
