This edit differs from others in that it does not drastically reduce the length, narrative focus of the movie or add any John Williams cues. Rise of the Rebellion seeks to restore heroes to the movie by slightly shifting their motivations and actions to produce a story that is filled with brave heroes and less distractions.","popularity":0.0786,"poster_path":"/8i5fPFgbTfXRws8ZjEliLF55A5p.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":128,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Star Wars: Rise of the Rebellion - A Rogue One Edit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AcY3eA59HyhpYy7BBH9XSleaGJX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":2867,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8i5fPFgbTfXRws8ZjEliLF55A5p.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
