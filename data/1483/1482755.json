Based on the classic symbolist play by Maurice Maeterlinck that the composer found to contain \"far more humanity\" than realism, Pelléas et Mélisande sets a tragic love triangle against some of Debussy's most soaringly dramatic music, all its Wagnerian flourishes brought out by Antonello Manacorda and the Paris Opera Orchestra.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/z3aWej2PDxbJh7AyMbQNJGMb9Dc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":179,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pelléas
