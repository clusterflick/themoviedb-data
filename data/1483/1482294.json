After Katie is harassed by a predator on Roblox, the trio uncovers a disturbing network of extremists, predators, and illicit content. As their investigation gains traction, real-world tragedies — including a kidnapping and a mass shooting — underscore the devastating consequences of a system failing to protect its most vulnerable users. Through expert interviews and gripping verité storytelling, the film exposes the gaps in platform regulations and the dangers that continue to slip through the cracks. Blending investigative journalism with compelling visuals, Dangerous Games delivers a wake-up call on the urgent need for accountability in the evolving digital world.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":60848,"logo_path":"/2K2abKnJHvMbI3s6Lnfi0xWwz67.png","name":"Fathom Film Group","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":75168,"logo_path":"/7QhlWdkgNchV1XK194QTbFNGy6v.png","name":"TVO","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2025-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Dangerous Games: Roblox and the Metaverse Exposed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1474172,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ann Shin","original_name":"Ann Shin","popularity":0.2852,"profile_path":"/qXc8iRWaNRIxwZy23sEtftezihC.jpg","credit_id":"68278a5f18ede4bbbd3dd36a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2156356,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Erica Leendertse","original_name":"Erica Leendertse","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":"/5hUbFBA9qx3CmBJmCJeFY31TvrO.jpg","credit_id":"68278c4038f80e640a7f6b6b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3703615,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Danielle Cole","original_name":"Danielle Cole","popularity":0.3968,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68278c64d8f0c650b08aa954","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1286023,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"James Klopko","original_name":"James Klopko","popularity":0.1722,"profile_path":"/lJWqDuYppHc6wgJfRAQcEKFGEib.jpg","credit_id":"68278d23cbd6f374337746bb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1889126,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Chris Romeike","original_name":"Chris Romeike","popularity":0.133,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68278d2d5685dcad4742f7af","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2657113,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lulu Wei","original_name":"Lulu Wei","popularity":0.2009,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68278d35bf45ab53523dd37f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128801,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Steve Taylor","original_name":"Steve Taylor","popularity":0.3849,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68278d53d6c8b3946f42f7af","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2597119,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Duncan Buchanan","original_name":"Duncan Buchanan","popularity":0.0755,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68278d5e647fe4939642f793","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1500087,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Carole Larsen","original_name":"Carole Larsen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68278d67f6c20b4dee3dd374","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36857152","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1576,"name":"technology"},{"id":174109,"name":"documentary filmmaking"},{"id":294546,"name":"video games"},{"id":294729,"name":"metaverse"},{"id":349457,"name":"canadian filmmaker"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"TVO","release_date":"2025-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer | Dangerous Games | Streaming May 25th at 9 am ET | TVO Original","key":"yVOmBpeKe_4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-04-16T16:15:06.000Z","id":"68278ab951139f4d793dd37a"}]}}}
