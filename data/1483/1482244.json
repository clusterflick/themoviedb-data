From the width of a football field to the size of a small city, these space rocks have the potential to be killers. In a collision with Earth, they could set off deadly blast waves, raging fires and colossal tidal waves. But some audacious entrepreneurs look up at asteroids and see payday, not doomsday. Some asteroids are loaded with billions of dollarsâ€™ worth of elements like iron, nickel and platinum.  NASA is planning an ambitious mission to return samples from a potentially hazardous asteroid, and would-be asteroid miners are dreaming up their own program to scout for potentially profitable asteroids. Will asteroids turn out to be our economic salvation or instruments of extinction?","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/leyVZLP0YPxvmEyleVSdE09et2v.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Asteroid: Doomsday or Payday?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1348922,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Challis","original_name":"Jonathan Challis","popularity":0.3126,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68277957a031e88cc15a40a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/leyVZLP0YPxvmEyleVSdE09et2v.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1423,"name":"asteroid"},{"id":4627,"name":"earth"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
