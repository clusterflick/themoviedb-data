The building is designed to be naturally and regularly flooded by the Atlantic Ocean tides. The film incorporates natural elements like tides, wind, rain, and light. I aim to depict a harmony between the body, the site's architecture, and the powerful nature of the location. The goal is to reveal a fragile balance between humans and nature on this ever-changing coastline. The creative process was intuitive and improvised, influenced by the moment and contributions from the dancer, director, tides, and weather.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sea Fragment","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5441996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laure Delamotte-Legrande","original_name":"Laure Delamotte-Legrande","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68271f75c94058087d4b5b13","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
