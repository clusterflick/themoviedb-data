When one of them leaves for the valley to spend Christmas vacation with his family he is temporarily replaced with an adolescent boy. The other man is both annoyed and intrigued by the boy and his habits: he listens to loud music, sleeps too long in the mornings and doesn't drink any alcohol. They barely speak to one another in the first couple of days. But when an avalanche cuts their small hut from electricity they slowly start growing more fond of each other.","popularity":0.4257,"poster_path":"/gFJ88hhy2Se6eqyul9zrTs6heu8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12660,"logo_path":null,"name":"22 Dicembre","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":93642,"logo_path":null,"name":"Edisonvolta","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1960-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time Stood Still","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":16,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"El tiempo se ha detenido","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1016126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natale Rossi","original_name":"Natale Rossi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1000,"character":"Natale","credit_id":"52fe49fe9251416c750da325","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1016127,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Roberto Seveso","original_name":"Roberto Seveso","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1001,"character":"Roberto Seveso","credit_id":"52fe49fe9251416c750da329","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1016128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paolo Guadrubbi","original_name":"Paolo Guadrubbi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1002,"character":"Salvetti","credit_id":"52fe49fe9251416c750da32d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27213,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ermanno Olmi","original_name":"Ermanno Olmi","popularity":0.1086,"profile_path":"/lecVjcE424bjCSvEEByvSDVuPbc.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49fe9251416c750da333","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3420236,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aniello Costabile","original_name":"Aniello Costabile","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b22c1257530e00a359b9ea","department":"Sound","job":"Orchestrator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33859,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lamberto Caimi","original_name":"Lamberto Caimi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/bkDUWGVygD9ec7QMwJU4uNfsipD.jpg","credit_id":"63b22c54c56d2d00d84369b7","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3317808,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Giancarlo Pizzirani","original_name":"Giancarlo Pizzirani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b22c7a2e2b2c00ddacb5ee","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1820603,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Attilio Torricelli","original_name":"Attilio Torricelli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b22cac5ad76b0094c8752e","department":"Crew","job":"Technical Advisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3541019,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Roberto Barbieri","original_name":"Roberto Barbieri","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b22cea1d1bf400a71ca038","department":"Camera","job":"Still Photographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27213,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ermanno Olmi","original_name":"Ermanno Olmi","popularity":0.1086,"profile_path":"/lecVjcE424bjCSvEEByvSDVuPbc.jpg","credit_id":"59213609c3a3687a4b05033f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1820600,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alberto Soffientini","original_name":"Alberto Soffientini","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59213611925141485e0575eb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1820601,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pier Emilio Bassi","original_name":"Pier Emilio Bassi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"592136199251414add051d11","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":50823,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Carlo Bellero","original_name":"Carlo Bellero","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"592136239251414ab10517c3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1208450,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Carla Colombo","original_name":"Carla Colombo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5921362cc3a36878fe04e63b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1820605,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ugo Franchini","original_name":"Ugo Franchini","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"592136389251414a5705146a","department":"Production","job":"Production Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1363712,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dino B.
