Before she shoots him on an isolated road, she gives him a minute to reflect on who he might have offended on his rise to the top. She's Angela de Vries, a contract killer based in L.A. She wants this to have been her last job; her contractor wants one more death, a national union leader, made to look like an accident. She starts her homework on this mark. Meanwhile, in her private life, she's in love with a budding photographer. Is there any way that she can get out of the game and have a full love life?","popularity":1.7921,"poster_path":"/jlZij4DSiDHFdx8yuKoQ28yBNlf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":176162,"logo_path":"/gk4tb53F2nl3a0xcUNCYrlPIktC.png","name":"ABC","origin_country":"US"},{"id":19326,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spelling-Goldberg
