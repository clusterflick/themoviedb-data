Then a pair of cop killings strikes the city. All signs point to the newly released Steele as the perpetrator. Has Ricco sprung a killer? Dean Martin keeps his affable ease but abandons his hipster Matt Helm-series swagger to portray Ricco in his final leading-role film, a whodunit mystery set in the city that also was the gritty center of action for the era’s Bullitt and Dirty Harry. Convinced that Steele isn’t behind the murders, Ricco launches an inquiry and runs up against a police lieutenant assigned to birddog him, evidence planted by a racist cop and several assassination attempts on Ricco himself. As the mystery deepens, so does the danger. And behind it all is someone the attorney never suspected. The pre-Laverne &amp; Shirley Cindy Williams plays Ricco’s office assistant.","popularity":2.3844,"poster_path":"/diyjRryB7TlNudXuS2PaudehF9G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1975-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The one thing people hate more than a cop killer...is the lawyer who gets him off!","title":"Mr. Ricco","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dean Martin","original_name":"Dean Martin","popularity":0.8514,"profile_path":"/lMWkTDKPsDVS3DiMUNkTLLjm3f5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Joe Ricco","credit_id":"52fe4a019251416c750da8c5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugene Roche","original_name":"Eugene Roche","popularity":0.376,"profile_path":"/cY9u3TxO4UlSkxrhqS8TPhpdzzT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"George Cronyn","credit_id":"52fe4a019251416c750da8c9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thalmus Rasulala","original_name":"Thalmus Rasulala","popularity":0.2456,"profile_path":"/5tVpd4FX7rXLAOIfLsLHlA6RmjK.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Frankie Steele","credit_id":"52fe4a019251416c750da8cd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":65398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denise Nicholas","original_name":"Denise Nicholas","popularity":0.3508,"profile_path":"/iLVYN8DuUFqF6s6cYWO8Zu4B8YT.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Irene Mapes","credit_id":"52fe4a019251416c750da8d1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8434,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cindy Williams","original_name":"Cindy Williams","popularity":0.8209,"profile_path":"/s1sbHduCNyXQcNhSZ44Y5UyK2dF.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jamison","credit_id":"52fe4a019251416c750da8d5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geraldine Brooks","original_name":"Geraldine Brooks","popularity":0.3206,"profile_path":"/pcjhypTQNPz7wAW8v6mc6oIFvz0.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Katherine Fremont","credit_id":"52fe4a019251416c750da8d9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70759,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Michael Thomas","original_name":"Philip Michael Thomas","popularity":0.4235,"profile_path":"/rrDuyqoclQRazUTFpTMz2tY9k0o.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Purvis Mapes (as Philip Thomas)","credit_id":"52fe4a019251416c750da8dd","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":176452,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Lee Smith","original_name":"Dennis Lee Smith","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Officer Hanley","credit_id":"542928e80e0a265566004b4a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34421,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Tyne","original_name":"George Tyne","popularity":0.274,"profile_path":"/qUVWU8q0cMeMzF79q5IWuRaxkce.jpg","cast_id":30,"character":"Lt.
