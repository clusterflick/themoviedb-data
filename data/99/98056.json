Their older brother is able to convert some of the doctor's small estate to cash. But it is late in the day, and with the banks closed he stores the money in his father's household safe. The slatternly housekeeper, aware of the money, enlists a criminal acquaintance to crack the safe. She attempts to get into the adjacent room where the sisters tremble in fear, but finds that the door is locked. The drunken housekeeper menaces them by brandishing a gun through a hole in the wall.","popularity":0.9041,"poster_path":"/pOnByQGjzMkay9aOerNkZlr2bDj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"TRAGEDY AND TORMENT...INNOCENCE ASSAILED...An Exceptional Photoplay","title":"An Unseen Enemy","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":29,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"El enemigo invisible","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Gish","original_name":"Lillian Gish","popularity":0.6523,"profile_path":"/6DCWtvv654sc8p2OPnxGbKvl2qC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Eldest Sister","credit_id":"52fe49fe9251416c750da303","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Gish","original_name":"Dorothy Gish","popularity":0.1851,"profile_path":"/pawOaoP0uk1NZ5vDLizFohzx6Tn.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Youngest Sister","credit_id":"52fe49fe9251416c750da307","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Harron","original_name":"Robert Harron","popularity":0.2252,"profile_path":"/8uqveFAwItcd5Ty2OEMPM37bbZb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Boyfriend","credit_id":"52fe49fe9251416c750da30b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128162,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elmer Booth","original_name":"Elmer Booth","popularity":0.0623,"profile_path":"/5uaPWjfyflDhfrek8uKO7HYdy3T.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The Brother","credit_id":"52fe49fe9251416c750da30f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1016129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Henderson","original_name":"Grace Henderson","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":"/h9DRMmxkbujKEBV4wKyS7hF5nqm.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"The Maid","credit_id":"52fe49fe9251416c750da313","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Carey","original_name":"Harry Carey","popularity":0.2712,"profile_path":"/AvNDsYjkLgeFHbxGFIFyl6QRgeM.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"The Safecracker","credit_id":"52fe49fe9251416c750da317","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolph Lestina","original_name":"Adolph Lestina","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/r7mwL8DBUy7A9MDgRejog9R2TPE.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"In Boardinghouse (uncredited)","credit_id":"5c04181fc3a3685c370ae839","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Miller","original_name":"Walter Miller","popularity":0.264,"profile_path":"/sg0Ruah5XQ4UhBAIMeEISqSwlQJ.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"The Brother's Friend (uncredited)","credit_id":"5c04182cc3a3685a4b0ae805","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Moreno","original_name":"Antonio Moreno","popularity":0.3889,"profile_path":"/swsEgnc8bkILLcOjUDPGtZdXnQs.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"On Bridge (uncredited)","credit_id":"5c04184e9251417e5505f383","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100036,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"D.W.
