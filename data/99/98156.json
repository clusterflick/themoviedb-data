His only thought was move a mound of snow to make the scene look a little better. His crew warn him it's a devil's box, but move it anyway. The first guy to pick up the box dies shortly after, having accidentally fallen off a roof. Tong's work declines, as does his health. He is diagnosed with a brain tumor, and begins to be pursued by… something evil.","popularity":0.1703,"poster_path":"/19P1G0YDdXMPhDW8Tua2cht68UE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88375,"logo_path":null,"name":"Verdull Ltd.
