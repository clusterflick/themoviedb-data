In three distinct portraits, we follow the wanderings of this modern-day Alice, a teenager searching for love on the internet, played by Julie Morel, the filmmaker's younger sister. Charmed by the virtual flattery of a young stranger, our Alice throws herself headlong into an irreversible spiral that will lead her to encounter her double and the Mad Hatter before facing the White Rabbit, a vile sexual predator.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mixtape 3 : Game Over","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
