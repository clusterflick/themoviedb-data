Captured on a 1985 VHS camcorder with color and luminosity distorted by its failing color Newvicon tube. Cut with distorted tape-recorded fragments of nostalgic broadcast television ephemera. Scored by whatever was handy— from an ambient electronic song with a surprising amount of pipe organ (Oneohtrix Point Never - Boring Angel) to midi versions of your favorite SNES soundtrack (Donkey Kong Country – Aquatic Ambience, Opening, and Treetop Rock) to a not-quite-right rendition of a song that will make you want to say “Oh, Angelo, that’s tearing my heart out!” (Xiu Xiu – Falling). A voyeuristic peak at home movies that exist somewhere between soon to be forgotten and forgotten long ago. The occasional dot matrix time stamps in the corner of the footage somehow make it harder to place in time.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/ge5x1RtnyirdBL2mgUIX9ZanyRK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":280620,"logo_path":null,"name":"JacoBryn Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Discarded Memories of the Past, Present, and Future","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5815488,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bryn Taylor","original_name":"Bryn Taylor","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6919f500ea22a108723a5395","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5821031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zachary Taylor","original_name":"Zachary Taylor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Heterophobic guy with broken lawn mower and lateral malleolus","credit_id":"6919f58bd282b6e6929c627b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5815486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacob Fiala","original_name":"Jacob Fiala","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Lawn mower repair man","credit_id":"6919f4ecd0450fa3063a5457","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5821041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathryn Taylor","original_name":"Kathryn Taylor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6919f6cd579b325ab63a571d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5815486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacob Fiala","original_name":"Jacob Fiala","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6919f657a22fcf5f0140f481","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5815486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacob Fiala","original_name":"Jacob Fiala","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6919f668540af423d04ca86e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5815486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacob Fiala","original_name":"Jacob Fiala","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6919f681ad78ce5faeac357c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ge5x1RtnyirdBL2mgUIX9ZanyRK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10887,"name":"home movie footage"},{"id":11616,"name":"vhs"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Noise Feast III - 621 Gallery in Tallahassee, FL","release_date":"2025-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
