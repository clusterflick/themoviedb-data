Introduced by NAACP leader Benjamin Hooks and narrated by Roscoe Lee Brown, the film weaves together dramatic readings, theatrical excerpts, and candid urban street footage. Margaret Walker’s poem For My People is performed alongside scenes of daily Black life in New York City — children playing, families on stoops, open fire hydrants, and the realities of poverty in 1970s neighborhoods. James Baldwin appears in interview footage, while signs for his play The Amen Corner and stage excerpts from Lorraine Hansberry’s A Raisin in the Sun underscore the powerful presence of Black voices in American theater. With rare shots of Harlem life, literature, and performance, this film documents the enduring contributions of African American artists to U.S. culture and history.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/f3qpk0wFa1OceZAtpiIOCIZUlhW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":222807,"logo_path":"/9jZCR0M3fY1Vp0PFoJOZVeVwrt4.png","name":"National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)","origin_country":"US"},{"id":37133,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Petersen Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1978-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Black Contribution: Literature and Theatre","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roscoe Lee Browne","original_name":"Roscoe Lee Browne","popularity":0.4902,"profile_path":"/zNOJbPMeQd5thNTA1dvb1ZT61mI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6918f3eee4f3f505af40f201","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":943183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Baldwin","original_name":"James Baldwin","popularity":0.3218,"profile_path":"/896fcLPuizfDHsrCK6EOtstWukE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6918f3ad9cdeac553487743b","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1020,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f3qpk0wFa1OceZAtpiIOCIZUlhW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":493,"name":"poem"},{"id":2132,"name":"literature"},{"id":13028,"name":"writer"},{"id":189920,"name":"harlem, new york city"},{"id":190675,"name":"black history"},{"id":237806,"name":"american art"},{"id":251436,"name":"african american history"},{"id":253780,"name":"african american art"},{"id":254834,"name":"black community"},{"id":256015,"name":"african american"},{"id":284103,"name":"theatre"},{"id":284182,"name":"black stories"},{"id":285695,"name":"theater"},{"id":346889,"name":"harlem"},{"id":350634,"name":"new york"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1978-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
