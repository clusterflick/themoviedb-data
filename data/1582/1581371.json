Trapped between ambition and emotional stillness, he drifts through concrete landscapes searching for clarity and a sense of home. The film follows his quiet, internal journey as he confronts loneliness, pressure, and the invisible weight of expectations.  Through minimal dialogue and atmospheric visuals, LCW explores how modern life can feel like a maze—cold, crowded, yet strangely isolating. The protagonist’s journey isn’t one of fear but of figuring things out: pausing, observing, and gradually recognizing the emotional anchors he has lost along the way.  Premiered at the Indie Meme Film Festival 2025 in Austin, the film captures the universal experience of being lost—not in terror but in thought—seeking direction in the middle of an urban jungle.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost in Concrete Woods","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30989144","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
