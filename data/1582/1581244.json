Based on two years of research into e-nose and Headspace technologies (collaborating with Japanese firm Takasago International Fragrances), the film speculates on new sensory relationships through aroma technologies. Part of a wider cross-disciplinary research project exploring aroma sensing and electronic nose technologies and ways in which they might assimilate into our cities to sense atmospheric information. The script shifts from molecular precision to poetic abstraction, blurring technology and human perception in a speculative language of memories coded in aroma.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2025-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phantom Bloom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5818639,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aaro Murphy","original_name":"Aaro Murphy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691893760d1d06c2f031d06d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Video Art Festival Turku","release_date":"2025-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
