The film leaves audiences with a series of provocative questions that culminate in one that will impact all of our futures: is water a human right or a commodity? Through a starkly emotional journey, the audience is invited to bear witness and encouraged to recognize this major global crisis as his or her very own. Filmed in 15 countries in both hemispheres, One Water churns together stirring visual sequences, compelling expert commentary, hypnotic local music and a score performed by the world-renowned Russian National Orchestra to immerse audiences in a direct and exhilarating experience of the meaning of water to humanity. The film highlights a world where water is exquisitely abundant in some places and dangerously lacking in others.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/tLVFkg8Ou0CNQD3heujC6y7SnI1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Water","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert F.
