Scorning her father's plea for her to curb her passion for beautiful clothes and live more modestly, she trips and is knocked unconscious. In a dream, Irene's father goes to Munson for financial assistance and Munson agrees, in exchange for her father agreeing to try to influence Irene to marry him. When it is announced at Irene's birthday party that she and Marshall have secretly married, Munson refuses to lend the money to Irene's father, who then kills himself with a pistol. After a series of tragic events, Irene awakens, and decides to marry Marshall.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/hq4rMUJ9apBpkctqYUfR7brlSDJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":164624,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chaplin-Mayer Pictures Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1921-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Habit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le Cauchemar","type":"French title"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"El hábito","type":"Spanish title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mildred Harris","original_name":"Mildred Harris","popularity":0.3242,"profile_path":"/2yID8kVxUmaldDBGzSV83gzsqKp.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Irene Fletcher","credit_id":"6919b991177ad7dd279c6033","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1130900,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"W.E.
