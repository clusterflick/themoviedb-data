Some of the finest dancers have appeared in this work by Sir Frederick Ashton, which has been staged at theatres around the world, including at the Paris Opera, Bolshoi Theatre, American Ballet Theatre, Boston Ballet and National Ballet of Canada.  Audiences are captivated by the storyline: will the wild young Lise fight for her love despite her desperately overprotective mother? Will she marry her beloved Colas? Or will she listen to her mother’s words and accept Alain, who is wealthy but a little bit “out of his head”?  This ballet celebrates the joy of life and, above all, love. It is colourful and full of humour, with dancers who simply make audiences smile.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/b1D6vujMmo8gWGOtM8f5vFuq5Kd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wayward Daughter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3428989,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jean Dauberval","original_name":"Jean Dauberval","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69190daf160c5cef5b40f236","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/b1D6vujMmo8gWGOtM8f5vFuq5Kd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10551,"name":"ballet"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
