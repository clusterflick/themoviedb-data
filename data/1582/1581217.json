Through this exchange, the artist seeks to explore a worldview unfamiliar to her – that of Vodun, the world’s largest nature-based religion. The work is a dive into Vodoun’s invisible realm and into questions concerning the relationship between belief, images, and reality. The pursuit of the invisible world initiated a personal process for the artist, in which various messages, dreams, and whispers of wind began, almost of their own accord, to carry the story forward.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2025-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Letter 1 / AIR","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5818552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miia Autio","original_name":"Miia Autio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69188a180cbb5899053a4e7d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Video Art Festival Turku","release_date":"2025-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
