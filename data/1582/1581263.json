What begins as one man’s creative leap becomes a collective act of courage, as the diverse cast commits to giving life to a painful, divisive moment in American history. For Adams, the story is personal—his own ancestors enslaved people and carried them into battle. For the ensemble, the project is more than performance: it is a chance to reach audiences across political and racial lines and foster empathy where division has long taken root. Blending rehearsal struggles, performance footage, and candid reflections, the film captures how a community of artists used theater to confront legacy, invite dialogue, and remind audiences that unity is still possible, even when history’s weight feels heaviest.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Shadow of the Mountain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5818912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Adams","original_name":"John Adams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6918af8f5ffda4900c4ca048","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5818907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nathan Knox","original_name":"Nathan Knox","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6918af32352b2467e7ac301e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5818908,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alexis Brunnert","original_name":"Alexis Brunnert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6918af50560020a6de40eecb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
