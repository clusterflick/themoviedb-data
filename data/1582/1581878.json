His pride is hurt when he is called \"Mr. Doris Fuller\" and by the disparity between their earnings. She quits to become his \"full time\" wife but returns to the screen when she sees him becoming a nervous wreck trying to write a play to boost their earnings. Kenneth erroneously believes her to be having an affair with her leading man, DeWitt Courtney, and begins to pay ardent attention to Nita Northrup, a rising young actress. His actions cause a real breach, and they separate. Kenneth's play is a success, but he is not happy. They are reconciled after Doris is injured in the studio, and she once more becomes his \"full time\" wife.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/6qMHZpXvNpwoK0lPm81f9IDNnVt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15254,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gotham Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Part-time Wife","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Esposas nas Horas Vagas","type":"Brazilian title"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Pieux mensonge","type":"French title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1271535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Calhoun","original_name":"Alice Calhoun","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/sk6xhqK93Tynypj4yV09fCRBkn6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Doris Fuller","credit_id":"691a5d9d5e680c8ec16d9066","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29347,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert Ellis","original_name":"Robert Ellis","popularity":0.9487,"profile_path":"/ecUP4Ja2FeuFZv9ADwuxs8uUHrs.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Kenneth Scott","credit_id":"691a5db913265c5b0652e7d7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Freeman Wood","original_name":"Freeman Wood","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":"/ngwL8sW1vOpUqEfx5oJQ5CzvTVx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"DeWitt Courtney","credit_id":"691a5dd0152b06f35f175c0d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edwards Davis","original_name":"Edwards Davis","popularity":0.0907,"profile_path":"/tZwEJcv0w7ruzWPYkw4XGJcdthX.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ben Ellis","credit_id":"691a5de80b7ecf25d181beae","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5385567,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janice Peters","original_name":"Janice Peters","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Nita Northrup","credit_id":"691a5e0e61a74647bf4467d0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1188043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Palmer","original_name":"Patricia Palmer","popularity":0.0912,"profile_path":"/6F0VqTnMXHUISSIKOGva741R13w.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"'Toddles' Thornton","credit_id":"691a5e25b49ff3c41d609555","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1119769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles West","original_name":"Charles West","popularity":0.1787,"profile_path":"/b83aIQMnrWmXxnYm5vbPI1izN7u.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Allen Keane","credit_id":"691a5e38e2f3f3d2565dfca9","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":32575,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Henry McCarty","original_name":"Henry McCarty","popularity":0.1075,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691a5e87d11cb8decbc7cbf7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2357345,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peggy Gaddis","original_name":"Peggy Gaddis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691a5ea903de8ab9080b5c31","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":32575,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Henry McCarty","original_name":"Henry McCarty","popularity":0.1075,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691a5eb4af0ccbe5d481bebe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2252041,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Victoria Moore","original_name":"Victoria Moore","popularity":0.044,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691a5ec11d8911ca60c7cc77","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1375447,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James J.
