Relying on films’ inherent unfaithfulness to geography, a few dialogue cues, and a great deal of coincidence, scenes from disparate films intersect and redirect each other to follow geographic patterns rather than their individual stories. Compositing closely cropped professional footage over wide-angle, contemporary video allows for the emergence of a disjointed document that captures the growth of a city over several decades; distilling a small amount of truth from a growing library of fiction.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2025-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Goin' Down The Road","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5696905,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian R.
