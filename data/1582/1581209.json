Ecological disasters caused by modernity had made life on Earth almost impossible. A community at the end of the world had managed to survive the sixth mass extinction, the heirs of an ancestral lineage (tuwvn), those who knew the chants (ul) of the Earth and could communicate with all human and non-human beings. They inhabited the Patagonian forests, were connected to the mycelial networks of the soil, and could access all the messages of the cosmos. They were \"recoverers\" of the forests, a territory they defended for a thousand years against extractive corporations and the colonial violence of modernity.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dreams of the Last Drum","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5818548,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alejandra Vanderland","original_name":"Alejandra Vanderland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691888d1d20f50e31d3a5192","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3350853,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Matias Kritz","original_name":"Matias Kritz","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691888f10cbb5899053a4e5f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Video Art Festival Turku","release_date":"2025-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
