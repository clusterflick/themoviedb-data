Leaving his hotel to buy flowers, Dan forgets his billfold but meets Julio Lachados, a former admirer of María's. As Dan crosses the street, he is knocked unconscious by an automobile, and the owner, Dr. Webster, has him taken to a private hospital. Failing to find her husband and learning that an unidentified man has been hospitalized, María becomes innocently involved with two jewel thieves, who kidnap her. Dan, regaining consciousness, leaves the hospital and is nursed by Sally Ray. Freed from her captors, María turns to Julio for help and learns of Dan's relationship with Sally, but Dan perceives Sally's duplicity and is reunited with his bride.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/fMtFzRaT3IFfyYLV6j3dMHzmnuz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/jay6WcMgagAklUt7i9Euwj1pzTF.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1927-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blind Alleys","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Saudades","type":"Brazilian title"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"暗の小路","type":"Japanese title"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Försvunnen i storstaden","type":"Swedish title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Meighan","original_name":"Thomas Meighan","popularity":1.6105,"profile_path":"/z701v4YI00eWNdTSjF566zXl4WY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Captain Dan Kirby","credit_id":"6918ff5e95143dfa46a0e9dd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evelyn Brent","original_name":"Evelyn Brent","popularity":1.6838,"profile_path":"/xGu2aE9ZpZMtwvpkuCl3kwsfuVv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sally Ray","credit_id":"6918ff7147d1fab49c31d3be","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":935037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greta Nissen","original_name":"Greta Nissen","popularity":0.2361,"profile_path":"/rPmObBgAHiLQBeWKvtsglnDKieG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Maria d'Alvarez Kirby","credit_id":"6918ff88c0b23dcca8ac30dc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5819453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugh Miller","original_name":"Hugh Miller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Julio Lachados","credit_id":"6918ffe2443c9c2d828775e2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Chalmers","original_name":"Thomas Chalmers","popularity":0.9227,"profile_path":"/3GQm41PVQsiLTWfrpSONi4kFtG8.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Dr. Webster","credit_id":"69190011883685b575a0d19d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tammany Young","original_name":"Tammany Young","popularity":1.5573,"profile_path":"/3rL59YH07PrW6xIHqnJ1ar4Umkf.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Gang Leader","credit_id":"69190032d282b6e6929c5eaa","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80727,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Tuttle","original_name":"Frank Tuttle","popularity":0.2106,"profile_path":"/nHq1loTuTtQs416Koylh91hspNk.jpg","credit_id":"6919007e6b8a39a9afac3240","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5819458,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emmet Crozier","original_name":"Emmet Crozier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6919008995143dfa46a0e9ea","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1191097,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Owen Davis","original_name":"Owen Davis","popularity":0.1237,"profile_path":"/5tfv4bMOLvzdJkwlHds6RfwXnwN.jpg","credit_id":"691900a3ad9e766f534cb094","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120449,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"William LeBaron","original_name":"William LeBaron","popularity":0.1371,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691900b6763b5097ddac31c2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558286,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alvin Wyckoff","original_name":"Alvin Wyckoff","popularity":1.1866,"profile_path":"/pMvx7fCqyLtpHgLLJXMqk8HlkMr.jpg","credit_id":"691900c47dc8f9e2c331d2e2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0017684","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":828,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fMtFzRaT3IFfyYLV6j3dMHzmnuz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":552}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1927-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
