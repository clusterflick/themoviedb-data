Through the deeply personal stories of patients, families, and caregivers, the film opens a tender window into laughter, grief, connection, and love during life’s final chapter.  Amid the complexities of America’s medical system, The Soft Surrender contrasts high-tech interventions with the compassion of palliative and hospice care—where comfort, dignity, and meaning are placed at the center of medicine.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/pzYTqje9yrqCPF9gizcCP3XG0gl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Soft Surrender","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5818932,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Randy Bacon","original_name":"Randy Bacon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6918b149d0450fa3063a4ef4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5818932,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Randy Bacon","original_name":"Randy Bacon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6918b15ed282b6e6929c5d79","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5818936,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Sommerfeld","original_name":"David Sommerfeld","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6918b17deba221c4a93a4ead","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5818938,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tara Bielinski","original_name":"Tara Bielinski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6918b196560020a6de40eee2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5818941,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Phil Melugin","original_name":"Phil Melugin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6918b1b0cf0d14c7a49c5d31","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":800,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pzYTqje9yrqCPF9gizcCP3XG0gl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
