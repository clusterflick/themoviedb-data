He faces intense and abusive instruction from his teacher, Fletcher, who constantly criticizes his tempo (1:28-1:30, 1:38). After a particularly harsh session, Nean has a confrontational interaction with his father (1:56-2:09) and later lashes out at Fletcher, regretting his actions (2:46-3:10). Feeling lost without drumming (3:15-3:19), Nean is then invited back by Fletcher, who acknowledges his importance to the group (3:22-3:27). The video culminates in a performance, where Fletcher continues to be critical, despite Nean's efforts (4:38-5:19).","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":280632,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moopland Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Best Drum Ever","title":"MOOPLASH","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5821254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zane Kanarr","original_name":"Zane Kanarr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Kneeman Chud Drummer","credit_id":"691a0ff89b2ed4e73f9c6350","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5821255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judah Henry","original_name":"Judah Henry","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Diddy Blud Fletcher","credit_id":"691a100555b34f734fa0ef1a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5821257,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Moop Stano","original_name":"Moop Stano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691a1033540af423d04ca952","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3401,"name":"drum"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"MOOPLASH: A Moopland Film","key":"IhkAYF6cdiM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2025-11-16T16:57:55.000Z","id":"691a10b9293cf5cbf03a5747"}]}}}
