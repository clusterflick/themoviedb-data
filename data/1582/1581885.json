The Baron goes to the house, and, by impersonating the architect, discovers the location of the safe and also gains the confidence of Mildred, who is angry at Robert for kissing a vamp. Mildred arranges with The Baron to feign a kidnapping in order to test Robert's loyalty; but she soon regrets the deception, for The Baron, having burgled the Patterson safe, really does abduct her. Trapped on a runaway train, she is rescued by Robert just as it crashes into a deep river. Mildred forgives Robert for his indiscretion with the vamp, and The Baron is apprehended.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/5jWFrKmcoB1MQo7JLyPmoCzhYQJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1924-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Troubles of a Bride","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"危機一髪","type":"Japanese title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1003143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Agnew","original_name":"Robert Agnew","popularity":0.1815,"profile_path":"/yDvVDhca5g2HACeOWfhZnqOFIXb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Robert Wallace","credit_id":"6919f0fea4a1c96cc831d8aa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1197286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mildred June","original_name":"Mildred June","popularity":0.0769,"profile_path":"/aZJl2ieyEDpF3zCsMnYmlciG1es.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mildred Patterson","credit_id":"6919f11d177ad7dd279c615a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Hale","original_name":"Alan Hale","popularity":1.6928,"profile_path":"/e90MwAMkxjDqr3wOnOhDAjvylW5.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gordon Blake","credit_id":"6919f134dc7b73f47c31d6dc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1313131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Covington","original_name":"Bruce Covington","popularity":0.9569,"profile_path":"/ogMrEZ4r0alE4NZODItRx9kBf0r.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Colonel Patterson","credit_id":"6919f146e4f3f505af40f5ab","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":119903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gloria Roy","original_name":"Gloria Roy","popularity":0.1793,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Vera","credit_id":"6919f191a5ef06b8d24ca2e2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1250223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinie Conklin","original_name":"Heinie Conklin","popularity":0.5114,"profile_path":"/37E72Hv6GpN4FbjIeMZgSToifsl.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jeff","credit_id":"6919f1aa595b54d1ff31da4e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":997751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lew Harvey","original_name":"Lew Harvey","popularity":0.2039,"profile_path":"/8uW9Gipg6fphtQl4d2D5tFKIunt.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Chauffeur","credit_id":"6919f1c96af729af9b40f26d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bud Jamison","original_name":"Bud Jamison","popularity":0.2208,"profile_path":"/AiiqQpcsDraQqYxkKwwKHmCU0QE.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Architect","credit_id":"6919f1dfdec356429f40f392","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1317628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Kenny","original_name":"Jack Kenny","popularity":0.1897,"profile_path":"/5T5Z9ypMcNYit9vVf3l54FdfkvL.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"(uncredited)","credit_id":"6919f1f66af729af9b40f276","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":323854,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tom Buckingham","original_name":"Tom Buckingham","popularity":0.0856,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6919f20aa4a1c96cc831d8b4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":323854,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tom Buckingham","original_name":"Tom Buckingham","popularity":0.0856,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6919f2149e0edb599f8777d0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109608,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Stone","original_name":"John Stone","popularity":0.1781,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6919f2247a7eb793f69aea7a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9078,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"William Fox","original_name":"William Fox","popularity":1.1519,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6919f235b83adf228eac3760","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0016458","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1420,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5jWFrKmcoB1MQo7JLyPmoCzhYQJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":947}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1924-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
