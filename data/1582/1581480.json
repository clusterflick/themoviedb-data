In the Seto Inland Sea, the abandoned post office of Awashima was transformed by artist Saya Kubota into a sanctuary for undelivered letters, sent to the lost, the dead, or no one at all. At 91, postmaster Katsuhisa Nakata continues to care for these fragments of memory. The Missing Post Office is a quiet, cinematic meditation on time, absence, and the emotional weight of words that may never be read.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Japan's
