She is a school girl living in Spain. John Barton, a soldier of fortune, is cast ashore in Spain penniless and scrapes an acquaintance with Ramona by rescuing one of her pets. He is putting up at a rather questionable tavern where he learns of a huge treasure buried by Firebrand, a pirate, and secures plans of the spot in which it is concealed. Ramona sails for Port Royal and Barton is on the same ship. Firebrand attacks the ship and captures as part of his booty Ramona, whom he appropriates for himself after Barton has been knocked overboard in her defense. Until the acquisition of Ramona, Firebrand's favorite has been Anna, who now becomes jealous of the Spanish beauty.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1KPdBQqOhBHQYsHWXTOAdaCI8e7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25599,"logo_path":"/sPZZwYvN3xEGo7q8E9iYKrggjDz.png","name":"Famous Players Film Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Slave Market","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Slavinden","type":"Danish title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":229607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pauline Frederick","original_name":"Pauline Frederick","popularity":0.1079,"profile_path":"/oZkkaaZf07bEa3LT0YXMoGlcqSm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ramona","credit_id":"69190be9fca9a2942a9ae6ce","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Meighan","original_name":"Thomas Meighan","popularity":1.6105,"profile_path":"/z701v4YI00eWNdTSjF566zXl4WY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"John Barton","credit_id":"69190bfa883685b575a0d1b1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1364551,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al Hart","original_name":"Al Hart","popularity":0.134,"profile_path":"/6dXQecaZvvO0OuseiFqX8bnhUia.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Firebrand","credit_id":"69190c0e55b34f734fa0ea22","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1796196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruby Hoffman","original_name":"Ruby Hoffman","popularity":0.1357,"profile_path":"/AehVIn14LoAwA0MzEpVPyismx6m.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Anna","credit_id":"69190c1f087f7fce383a5006","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1132934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wellington A.
