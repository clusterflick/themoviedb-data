Jansen induces in Burke a hypnotic trance in which he sees his future with each of the women. If he marries Helen, he will have fame, material comforts, and political power, but no love from his wife. If he marries Rita, his life will be humble but happy until Captain Pring's first mate, Jim McLeod, stirs up trouble and a shot is fired at Burke. Jansen cannot tell if the shot means death to Burke; nevertheless, Burke unhesitatingly chooses life with Rita.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/nqg7K2UIVeOye9ILwRGGknZt7sU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/jay6WcMgagAklUt7i9Euwj1pzTF.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1922-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Man Who Saw Tomorrow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Mellem to kvinder","type":"Danish title"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"El hombre que vio el futuro","type":"Spanish title"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Mannen med sjätte sinnet","type":"Swedish title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Meighan","original_name":"Thomas Meighan","popularity":1.6105,"profile_path":"/z701v4YI00eWNdTSjF566zXl4WY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Burke Hammond","credit_id":"691902824d06e33f414ca370","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theodore Roberts","original_name":"Theodore Roberts","popularity":9.8061,"profile_path":"/zyNQbifLkL42CaVvRKh2tG659q4.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Captain Morgan Pring","credit_id":"691902994d06e33f414ca374","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leatrice Joy","original_name":"Leatrice Joy","popularity":0.1908,"profile_path":"/mUrizNrPg9AfitR1kQLQnKdxEAT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Rita Pring","credit_id":"691902b287eb54ced231d261","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Roscoe","original_name":"Alan Roscoe","popularity":0.1944,"profile_path":"/r7dI0JkuISCWV7rVbPqWgDMMEtB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jim McLeod","credit_id":"691902ca47d1f03e92a0e8a7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alec B.
