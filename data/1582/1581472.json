On the suggestion of sculptress Katherine Dare, Isabel travels to Europe, leaving her husband permission to use her bank account. Leonard steadily declines in her absence and is on the verge of suicide when he meets Ella Klotz, a waif who is about to kill herself because she is going blind. He takes Ella to his studio to care for her, and believing he owes his life to the girl, Leonard once again begins to write. Meanwhile, Isabel is being pursued by an old suitor named Heminway, but realizes that she still loves her husband and returns from Europe. Heminway tries unsuccessfully to keep the couple apart.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/zOLoyh1XAufCunPAWk9L4xBk11F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/jay6WcMgagAklUt7i9Euwj1pzTF.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1921-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Easy Road","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Millionær-tyven","type":"Danish title"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"La Pente facile","type":"French title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Easy Street","type":"Working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Meighan","original_name":"Thomas Meighan","popularity":1.6105,"profile_path":"/z701v4YI00eWNdTSjF566zXl4WY.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Leonard Fayne","credit_id":"691905e2dfa0d780768773c2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gladys George","original_name":"Gladys George","popularity":0.3106,"profile_path":"/yniYGj7MqG13UZNLDQWh28RR6tK.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Isabel Grace","credit_id":"691905fa9de4988bb440f032","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1058730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Goodall","original_name":"Grace Goodall","popularity":0.1254,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Katherine Dare","credit_id":"6919061efca9a2942a9ae6c2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Edmund Carewe","original_name":"Arthur Edmund Carewe","popularity":0.2027,"profile_path":"/oU2gb8ZKlXfdze6JcLJCAQTH5i6.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Heminway","credit_id":"69190665312ecd29889ae599","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lila Lee","original_name":"Lila Lee","popularity":0.3146,"profile_path":"/2AiD7dau2Fhu8bE7x7vthdu9Ism.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Ella Klotz","credit_id":"6919067eef8e97fa7640f0df","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2358878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Anson","original_name":"Laura Anson","popularity":0.1362,"profile_path":"/8z12OTx5pKzkJeiwrwHf6GOIH76.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Minnie Baldwin","credit_id":"6919068e64907fabe331d6a2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1476561,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viora Daniel","original_name":"Viora Daniel","popularity":0.0945,"profile_path":"/8mP8zubwVqZNnM8VlwfS91WNSFu.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Laura","credit_id":"6919069f763b5097ddac31f3","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1353439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Forman","original_name":"Tom Forman","popularity":0.2462,"profile_path":"/x7PeSVwe1ZELinEEAOCTbAPlVw4.jpg","credit_id":"6919057727297f2e379ae4b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1150899,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Beulah Marie Dix","original_name":"Beulah Marie Dix","popularity":0.1166,"profile_path":"/6Llr7OPTHuoSjhHGfCCkHXPgdWh.jpg","credit_id":"69190584e24e363ff9877030","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3348469,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hugh McNair Kahler","original_name":"Hugh McNair Kahler","popularity":0.0713,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691905a6d20f50e31d3a5401","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102504,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Harry Perry","original_name":"Harry Perry","popularity":0.0616,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691905b4b83adf228eac3346","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1169034,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harold Schwartz","original_name":"Harold Schwartz","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691905cc439ec46d719ae473","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0012130","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1420,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zOLoyh1XAufCunPAWk9L4xBk11F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":947}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1921-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
