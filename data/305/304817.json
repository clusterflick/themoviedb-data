Set in Zhi Zi Luo village in the stunning Nu Jiang Canyon of Yunnan, the film focuses on two very different men and their daily lives. Locally born Zhou has returned after graduating from college, and now runs a hotel, karaoke bar and other businesses, whereas devout Christian Jia arrived in the 1990s as a forestry worker and married a local girl. As the village undergoes political changes, the film explores the dance of modernity and tradition against a backdrop of everyday dreams and hopes, love and loss.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bi Jiang","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1387192,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhou Wei","original_name":"Zhou Wei","popularity":0.0679,"profile_path":"/ouxl8rR9GemuiOD3bEWtvroafBd.jpg","credit_id":"546dce1f9251412bbf001a3d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
