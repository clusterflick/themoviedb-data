The story is \"a Nebraska ranching empire heiress murders her husband, butchers him the way her father taught her to butcher a hog, and 'cures' him in the meat cellar.\" The story is loosely based on various Nebraska news items, rumors, and a play written by the director. The play was produced by The Lorraine Hansberry Theater in San Francisco CA in 1993. The director and the actors completely improvised the dialogue and action. The movie was mostly green screened and each scene is a 'painting.'","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Indigo Lady","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
