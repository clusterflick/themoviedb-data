Ultimately, over 100 women architects and designers worked with Wright, many of them going on to remarkable careers of their own. In his studio in Oak Park and at both Taliesin Fellowships, Wright trained and practiced with women as draftsmen, designers, and fellow visionaries. A Girl is a Fellow Here focuses on six of those womenâ€”Marion Mahony, Isabel Roberts, Lois Gottlieb, Jane Duncombe, Eleanore Pettersen, and Read Weber.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Girl Is a Fellow Here: 100 Women Architects in the Studio of Frank Lloyd Wright","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386604,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beverly Willis","original_name":"Beverly Willis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546b3e5e92514117ea0015a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1853486","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
