In the first movement various motifs or themes are introduced, which are again picked up and developed in the third movement.  Six spheres, evolved in the first movement, become the sole subject matter–or “dancers”–of the second movement, which consists of a simple type of ballet using the floor-plan choreography or traditional ballet as a basis of interest.","popularity":0.3501,"poster_path":"/eQZPOAK6nlIaZ0ChSQmtdZrY1gq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38820,"logo_path":null,"name":"Belgian Ministries of Education & Communication","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1948-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rubens","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386876,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Haesaerts","original_name":"Paul Haesaerts","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"546c3e9ac3a368096b000a94","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386876,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Haesaerts","original_name":"Paul Haesaerts","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546c3ec0c3a3680970000b34","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386877,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Raymond Chevreuille","original_name":"Raymond Chevreuille","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546c3f339251413059000a0e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130033,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henri Storck","original_name":"Henri Storck","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":"/hbOCma9IFYX4f8iNVegyEw2z5Aa.jpg","credit_id":"546c3ef69251413056000aca","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386876,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Haesaerts","original_name":"Paul Haesaerts","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546c3eb5c3a368096d000af0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130033,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henri Storck","original_name":"Henri Storck","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":"/hbOCma9IFYX4f8iNVegyEw2z5Aa.jpg","credit_id":"546c3f05c3a36809740009f9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130033,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henri Storck","original_name":"Henri Storck","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":"/hbOCma9IFYX4f8iNVegyEw2z5Aa.jpg","credit_id":"546c3ee7c3a3680978000b48","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130033,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henri Storck","original_name":"Henri Storck","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":"/hbOCma9IFYX4f8iNVegyEw2z5Aa.jpg","credit_id":"546c3f17925141305d000ac1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0041828","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eQZPOAK6nlIaZ0ChSQmtdZrY1gq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5918,"name":"painting"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":208689,"name":"henri storck"},{"id":208690,"name":"rubens"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB (Venice)","release_date":"1948-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
