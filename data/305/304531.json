Its practice and meaning have been greatly abused throughout history. Within the context of the West the question one might ask: \"In a free country, why are women choosing to veil?\" In a very intimate and meditative mode, three Muslim women reflect around issues of cultural memory, identity, self-censorship, feminism, politics and media. By appreciating the personal and experiential quality of veiling, this documentary is able to articulate critically and reflexively while challenging its popular perception.","popularity":0.0762,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"\"I wasn't always dressed like this\"","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
