Capturing the full atmosphere of this unique musical event, ths video includes an overwhelming performance of Mendelssohn's Second Symphony, \"Lobgesang\" with its celebratory choral last movement and the ever-popular overture A Midsummer Night's Dream - both from critically revised new editions. Anne Schwanewilms and Peter Seiffert are the outstanding vocal soloists. The Gewandhaus Orchestra can look back on its history with pride - it has evolved into one of the world's most renowned orchestras working with the best international conductors. The bonus film Chailly in Leipzig: The Gewandhaus Orchestra welcomes its new Kapellmeister allows a glimpse into this new and fruitful relationship.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chailly Conducts Mendelssohn","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
