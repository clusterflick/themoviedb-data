Shankar ferries people in his boat, while Shambhu chops trees for a living. Their friendship, habits, and hobbies are the same, so much so that both fall in love with the same young woman, Reshma. But Reshma gives her heart to Shankar, and decides to marry him. This angers Shambhu, and he decides not to have to do with Shankar and his mom anymore. Then the Thakur's new-found son decides to close the ferries, and operate a motorized boat. He challenges Shankar to a race, with the loser having to leave the community and the profession, to which Shankar agrees.","popularity":0.3481,"poster_path":"/AqhgthOBC44uVU7qpV3MzjkG98B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deewana Tere Naam Ka","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mithun Chakraborty","original_name":"Mithun Chakraborty","popularity":2.5873,"profile_path":"/zohhWjk7BAPhLFcVddVSmpoR2qa.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Shankar","credit_id":"6163f4b2b865eb00427be079","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1655316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vijayata Pandit","original_name":"Vijayata Pandit","popularity":0.0817,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Reshma","credit_id":"6163f4ba53866e0048a49f79","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danny Denzongpa","original_name":"Danny Denzongpa","popularity":1.4505,"profile_path":"/xDNLtgG8iDXxNRvSDjpuNSNfKvX.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Shambhu","credit_id":"6163f4c391745b00684900de","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1943583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Master Bhagwan","original_name":"Master Bhagwan","popularity":0.0861,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6163f4cd33ec260028f34605","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharat Saxena","original_name":"Sharat Saxena","popularity":0.519,"profile_path":"/ArW6nQ23bjVfbcFmNVl4W9zpd7X.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Munim's Adopted Son","credit_id":"6163f4da1108a80042a2599f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kamal Kapoor","original_name":"Kamal Kapoor","popularity":0.1313,"profile_path":"/9imyGptzhAkjMTwe1sj10XUCUy2.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Thakur","credit_id":"6163f4e6873f000042349e5e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1061590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leena Das","original_name":"Leena Das","popularity":0.0811,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Dancer / Singer","credit_id":"6163f4fd84591c0023df58d7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":618699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jagdeep","original_name":"Jagdeep","popularity":0.3696,"profile_path":"/fDhNk4zi18lp3s69Q1Hu7n6X7wr.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Dilip Devraj Ghayal Shikarpuri","credit_id":"6307b13e0398ab007a28f384","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":593137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yunus Parvez","original_name":"Yunus Parvez","popularity":0.1758,"profile_path":"/8y0u0NS7j9lzffw8ePGxf6NNLpr.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Munim","credit_id":"6307b17b48138200837f0613","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3334407,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gautam Bhatia","original_name":"Gautam Bhatia","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6307b29015794a008351c496","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1043346,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Raam Laxman","original_name":"Raam Laxman","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6307b2a7bb070d0095ae666d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1081645,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deepak Bahry","original_name":"Deepak Bahry","popularity":0.1812,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6307b26f6e938a007eb5d61c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0405864","wikidata_id":"Q5251026","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nvIQDy68Nj3ZdZhTKUekt4B5tsa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AqhgthOBC44uVU7qpV3MzjkG98B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":315446,"name":"bollywood"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
