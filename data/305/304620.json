He loses his job and girlfriend in one week. As Joseph begins to rebuild his life from a 'bad luck roller coaster ride,' his personal chaos begins to manifest at home through unexpected occurrences. Joseph starts to feel a metamorphosis of his being- of his world within his walls. Sure enough, like Murphy's Law, life starts to become even more complicated when a strange group of men begin investigating Joseph without cause. Joseph decides to stop the madness of events and pursue his own investigation. Life and its invisible forces convince Joseph there must be a logical explanation. Skeptical, Joseph looks to find the truth- but what was coming took him beyond.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Exhumation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4774926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Perez","original_name":"Mike Perez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Joseph","credit_id":"666c4f772f2d14fd1c7651fe","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3464520,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kurt S.
