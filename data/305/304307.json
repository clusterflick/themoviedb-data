She travels and lives for a few years in Switzerland, then returns back to Bombay, India, and has a run-in with some slum-dwellers near Juhu. A few days later she is abducted by two men, who had initially claimed to be palace guards, and is rescued by a male named Raju Khan, a career thief and con-man, who was one of the slum dwellers in Juhu.
