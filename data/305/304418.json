As a result, Panizza was imprisoned for obscenity. Schroeter alternates scenes from the Panizza’s work with a dramatization of his trial, presenting the play as an expressionist spectacle performed by actors wearing exaggerated makeup who gesture and grimace grotesquely. The film thus forms a bridge between Schroeter’s use of tableaux in his early experiments with the political urgency of his 1980s films. On the eve of the AIDS crisis, Schroeter is presciently worried about disease as an excuse for governmental repression and the oppression of sexuality. - Harvard Film Archive","popularity":0.5188,"poster_path":"/k9YhUIyjRFHaWkRikYWF3uv4Y0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1982-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Liebeskonzil","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Salines","original_name":"Antonio Salines","popularity":0.1389,"profile_path":"/nLz6lePlHNQ7WDT9mRN8MTJ1BnB.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Teufel / Dr. Panizza","credit_id":"64dd171c001bbd041c8ff604","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":45197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Magdalena Montezuma","original_name":"Magdalena Montezuma","popularity":0.1573,"profile_path":"/yGsF8Ig9ml3egdANVCrjoQPGWqw.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Doppelzeugin","credit_id":"549c4816c3a3682f16003de9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kurt Raab","original_name":"Kurt Raab","popularity":0.2078,"profile_path":"/wVtzUW8bi4Xmupsjoms369qjIKG.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Gerichtspräsident","credit_id":"549c4824c3a3682f19003fbc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":295908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renzo Rinaldi","original_name":"Renzo Rinaldi","popularity":0.1855,"profile_path":"/8PfA3hpC1HuudrMQ04QdPwdsTSy.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Gottvater","credit_id":"64dd1740b5400200c6f427c9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margit Carstensen","original_name":"Margit Carstensen","popularity":0.2414,"profile_path":"/3o7Nl96wQI7WRMI1beZwGtLCcKz.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Staatsanwältin","credit_id":"549c4831c3a3682f1e003cfb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinrich Giskes","original_name":"Heinrich Giskes","popularity":0.267,"profile_path":"/m71OlClUZd1DVnJhcG3lpWbuy4E.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Verteidiger","credit_id":"549c483ec3a3682f1e003d01","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":545823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agnès Nobecourt","original_name":"Agnès Nobecourt","popularity":0.1083,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Maria","credit_id":"64dd174d001bbd0418c41f35","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1414422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto Tesconi","original_name":"Roberto Tesconi","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Christus","credit_id":"64dd175d001bbd041af3ef3d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2024079,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lauro Versari","original_name":"Lauro Versari","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/9eKv49VAJ8dGhBaFKjzPdR0ptjG.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Cherubim","credit_id":"64dd1786b77d4b1141f83e2f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1303356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrizia La Fonte","original_name":"Patrizia La Fonte","popularity":0.0574,"profile_path":"/q9Yoj51wA1kNFnGm7i7prwLxAsJ.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Selbstmörder-Engel","credit_id":"64dd179ab77d4b1141f83e3c","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1883854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guido Polito","original_name":"Guido Polito","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"2.
