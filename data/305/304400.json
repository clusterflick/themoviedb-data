The Black Angel is a transitional film; on one hand, it is a companion piece to Willow Springs, featuring two Schroeter regulars as characters far from home and in extremis; on the other hand, it is a film essay about Mexico and as such a harbinger of Schroeter’s nonfiction work to come. While he clearly shares his characters’ fascination with Mexico, the filmmaker also savages touristic exoticism – the otherworldly appearances of his protagonists and their rapturous reactions to new surroundings contrast sharply with the sober perceptions of Mexican history and economics featured in the documentary segments and in the prosaic presence of a non-professional cast of locals. - Harvard Film Archive","popularity":0.1666,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":47759,"logo_path":null,"name":"Werner Schroeter Filmproduktion","origin_country":""},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1974-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Black Angel","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":45197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Magdalena Montezuma","original_name":"Magdalena Montezuma","popularity":0.1573,"profile_path":"/yGsF8Ig9ml3egdANVCrjoQPGWqw.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"546cb2ef925141305f0017e5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":44441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellen Umlauf","original_name":"Ellen Umlauf","popularity":0.1473,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"546cb2f8925141304c00198a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos De Muna","original_name":"Carlos De Muna","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"546cb2e6c3a3680970001960","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45192,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Werner Schroeter","original_name":"Werner Schroeter","popularity":0.464,"profile_path":"/rLOcMEdwo30tGk7Qpx3QS676isI.jpg","credit_id":"546cb2d8c3a368097d0018b1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45192,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Werner Schroeter","original_name":"Werner Schroeter","popularity":0.464,"profile_path":"/rLOcMEdwo30tGk7Qpx3QS676isI.jpg","credit_id":"546cb2d29251413059001594","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":51053,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Christine Leyrer","original_name":"Christine Leyrer","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff2dd1055c926003e40b898","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45192,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Werner Schroeter","original_name":"Werner Schroeter","popularity":0.464,"profile_path":"/rLOcMEdwo30tGk7Qpx3QS676isI.jpg","credit_id":"5ff2dd1846e75f003fd3a02f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45192,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Werner Schroeter","original_name":"Werner Schroeter","popularity":0.464,"profile_path":"/rLOcMEdwo30tGk7Qpx3QS676isI.jpg","credit_id":"5ff2dceed2f5b500402f02b7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45192,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Werner Schroeter","original_name":"Werner Schroeter","popularity":0.464,"profile_path":"/rLOcMEdwo30tGk7Qpx3QS676isI.jpg","credit_id":"5ff2dcf67aecc60040fe5a2a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0073669","wikidata_id":"Q3202004","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-05-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
