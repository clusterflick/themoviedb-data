There's constantly some kind of excitement going on in their house:  this time, Marion takes in a barking dog, much against the wishes of her husband; that time she's harrasses the old servant; then countless traffic tickets from the police come in the mail; or high bills for extravagant huts are delivered by the mailman.  Finally, Fritz blows a fuse.  In the presence of his friend, Professor Endres, and Marion's mother, a big fight breaks out between the couple.","popularity":0.2274,"poster_path":"/7V8pDO0V9RMRDnM6y96hLRHGAUi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15730,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bavaria-Filmkunst","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1943-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die
