Piet Zwart worked as an interior and industrial designer, commercial typographer, photographer, critic and lecturer, playing a key role in defining the design climate in the Netherlands in the Twentieth Century. He is especially known for designing the famous ‘Piet Zwart’ kitchen for the Dutch company Bruynzeel: a kitchen that could be easily produced and consisted of standardized elements. His versatility and influence on present-day designers led the Association of Dutch Designers to award him the title of “Designer of the Century” in 2000.","popularity":0.6001,"poster_path":"/unKoLaWjGXfduasfTgHk3nz10H3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56958,"logo_path":null,"name":"Memphis Film & Television","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everything Must Change: Piet Zwart","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5046167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Piet Zwart","original_name":"Piet Zwart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self – Archive Footage","credit_id":"672d3844ebe21def08c8e128","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2280694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wim Crouwel","original_name":"Wim Crouwel","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"672d3852ebe21def08c8e12f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1395744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kees Broos","original_name":"Kees Broos","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"672d3862fc658fd33c29fd75","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1203315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sherman De Jesus","original_name":"Sherman De Jesus","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546bc327c3a368513f0008f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1203315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sherman De Jesus","original_name":"Sherman De Jesus","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672d38776c10939a515153e1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3128995,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Marijke Huijbregts","original_name":"Marijke Huijbregts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672d3897fc658fd33c29fd85","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1492861,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cécile van Eijk","original_name":"Cécile van Eijk","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672d38a75a20459207415bca","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35506,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marc Felperlaan","original_name":"Marc Felperlaan","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672d38c1ebe21def08c8e17f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1185247,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gregor Meerman","original_name":"Gregor Meerman","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672d38d5fc658fd33c29fdb3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1700750,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sander Kuipers","original_name":"Sander Kuipers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672d38e3de511ed7da6a5faa","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1294552,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mark Glynne","original_name":"Mark Glynne","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672d38f45a20459207415bfb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2561285,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"jef grosfeld","original_name":"jef grosfeld","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672d39025a20459207415c0b","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2278817","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1414,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/unKoLaWjGXfduasfTgHk3nz10H3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":160077,"name":"design"},{"id":213498,"name":"graphic design"},{"id":222943,"name":"typography"},{"id":272806,"name":"dutch"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Everything Must Change - Piet Zwart (Alles Moet Nieuw - Piet Zwart) (2012) - Trailer","key":"2-daluqIlu4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2013-05-17T10:20:25.000Z","id":"672d37a2de511ed7da6a5ed6"}]}}}
