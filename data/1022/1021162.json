But contrary to appearances, his destiny was full of pitfalls. This film lifts the veil on a founding childhood that allowed him to overcome many obstacles throughout his life thanks to the tutelary figures of his father and mother. Told from the inside with the help of his autobiography, interviews and unpublished archives, this epic story traces the career of this turbulent young actor who launched the New Wave in Breathless before becoming the popular Bebel, an indestructible and provocative vigilante. From film to film, this documentary paints an intimate portrait of a man who built himself up to reach the top: his triumphs but also his trials, his doubts, his secrets, his angers, his clowning, his disappointments or his personal dramas.","popularity":0.3623,"poster_path":"/b1LDBZDOTG9wfYmZZQUy4dSRySe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108980,"logo_path":"/dOLuWxizTZZP5NOrhkln2KC5Xt6.png","name":"Les Bons Clients","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Belmondo l'incorrigible","video":false,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Paul Belmondo","original_name":"Jean-Paul Belmondo","popularity":1.2077,"profile_path":"/hXAM7zTXGWVAv0VLGGrnxAJJbca.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6766f377919287ef539107e3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1639037,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"François Lévy-Kuentz","original_name":"François Lévy-Kuentz","popularity":0.0959,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"631703cd1511aa0080d93c5b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2073370,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bertrand Collard","original_name":"Bertrand Collard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d3d333031a1d0083a0eaf3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1474299,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thibaut Camurat","original_name":"Thibaut Camurat","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d3d31e66ae4d00c1cfed4c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1954752,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vincent Mauduit","original_name":"Vincent Mauduit","popularity":0.1148,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d3d32bcb71b8007c1c2e80","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2130230,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Christine Marier","original_name":"Christine Marier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d3d317031a1d0079d602f1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1474298,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Loïc Bouchet","original_name":"Loïc Bouchet","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d3d324cb71b80085de64ed","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21990870","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/kWRFTFsrxufHvZKYyNs5k7fWPHL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b4nMcTpMiHUnz22bHPhdFIlcqqx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/b1LDBZDOTG9wfYmZZQUy4dSRySe.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/p3tRzF9KQPSOnxH8zgeFsKbczue.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":724},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/pdBd2cL93wIivznzB8ii3v8OAGc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2679,"name":"artist"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":33490,"name":"filmmaking"},{"id":213803,"name":"french cinema"},{"id":222269,"name":"movie mogul"},{"id":266245,"name":"movie producer"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"France 3","release_date":"2022-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
