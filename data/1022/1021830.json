Filmed solo, it spans multiple sites across the world to form a polyvocal, mythopoetic film about the censorship of books, destruction of libraries, assaults on knowledge and free press, and the loss of languages in embattled communities. Like leaves of an enduring tree, the voices of multiple people and their actions demonstrate the persistent value and power of books, archives, shadow and pirate libraries as vehicles of resistance.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/26weh0K5i74USwh4sMtK5WtEMe6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Talking Leaves","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3691962,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Daniel Hui","original_name":"Daniel Hui","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6318ae4e0f0da5009b472dfb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3691961,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shubigi Rao","original_name":"Shubigi Rao","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6318ae1b1d1bf400903847ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2438438,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zai Tang","original_name":"Zai Tang","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6318ae6f22931a007fb9207b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3691961,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shubigi Rao","original_name":"Shubigi Rao","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6318ae2a46e75f00a5754e9d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/26weh0K5i74USwh4sMtK5WtEMe6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":853}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
