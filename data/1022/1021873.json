Despite threats from her then-husband and the disapproval of Korean society, In-sun found love and chose to be with Soohyun. Now, the two of them—who came to work as nurses in a foreign country where they knew nothing of the language—are still there and already in their 70s. For 30 years, they have lived together in Berlin and shared in all the joys and sorrows of life. Soohyun and In-sun have stood in solidarity with other foreigners like themselves while also looking after one another. They are two people who overcame boundaries. This is their love story.","popularity":0.0506,"poster_path":"/si0rDqCj3fOeH970GzKtdnC62eN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53366,"logo_path":"/5fbWZ4BsG9gh50cay7lOj5aKguu.png","name":"Cinema Dal","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2025-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life Unrehearsed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"Du salam","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3692916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Banpark Ji-eun","original_name":"Banpark Ji-eun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6319cfc046e75f00888b8bf9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3692916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Banpark Ji-eun","original_name":"Banpark Ji-eun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632b5d4ad71fb4007d5fbafd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3557164,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kim Kyu-man","original_name":"Kim Kyu-man","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63441d1acf62cd00990d6a0b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3692916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Banpark Ji-eun","original_name":"Banpark Ji-eun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678255ae90f42c32837b07cc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2406016,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kim Sae-bom","original_name":"Kim Sae-bom","popularity":0.1691,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678255bb218fd57acf4ed750","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22173626","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ibyzWoxIF3C4VlxWn1hJEOZayEZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/si0rDqCj3fOeH970GzKtdnC62eN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":2126,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/5lPiNAaCHD8jf6uAkHMjmXJxe1j.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1484},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/AaEEnmBApJ6kpuNPxg2NZFcGCSX.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1701,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/cSGM9LVT4MzKI9lwzO3sZNQIRb0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1187},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oGIrLbOJhDfNunGX01Up3re4HXf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Women Direct.
