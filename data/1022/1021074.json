The paintings of the ex-commander in chief and first lady, by artists Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald, were revealed to much fanfare at the National Portrait Gallery in 2018. The portraits — which drew record attendance to the Washington art museum — have since traveled the country as part of a nationwide exhibition.","popularity":0.8761,"poster_path":"/yM9qPuoeCVokKGoQ8iXakAgb0uG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Picturing the Obamas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1982282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kehinde Wiley","original_name":"Kehinde Wiley","popularity":0.1491,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"631687381d3143007dcfda3a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barack Obama","original_name":"Barack Obama","popularity":1.0798,"profile_path":"/reEkbvLlNknpCo2I37Vim6XpqGu.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6316873f5f2b8d009281541a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":964843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michelle Obama","original_name":"Michelle Obama","popularity":0.6363,"profile_path":"/aoumtex4PjUmG2sYp3VaLrarmBl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"631687475507e9007ac1b984","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1842541,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hannah Brown Ayers","original_name":"Hannah Brown Ayers","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63227a7433ad8f007a9edb43","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1842542,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lance Warren","original_name":"Lance Warren","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63227a87f14dad008288465b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22057568","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hgxgYmjv5Ysa6diMBVzU7ww0gE3.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yZCcgUe1bd8YdIYjanXl4HVr175.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":16.805,"height":257,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mTsNFzJrz6LMXGdbPIcsvhjSotR.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":4319}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yM9qPuoeCVokKGoQ8iXakAgb0uG.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":840,"name":"usa president"},{"id":11033,"name":"first lady"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Smithsonian Channel","release_date":"2022-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
