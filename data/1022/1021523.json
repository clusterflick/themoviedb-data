The story is based on the prose series Kim Van Kieu by Thanh Tam Tai Nhan and set in China during the reign of Emperor Gia Tinh during the Ming Dynasty (from 1521 to 1567). The characters include governor Ho Ton Hien, prostitute Vuong Thuy Kieu, and Tu Hai, a real historical figure who was a merchant and pirate leader of the Ming Dynasty.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/upDsWNg8yvsukxSaqY4FSLkyqnX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1924-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kim Vân Kiều","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3691159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tám Long","original_name":"Tám Long","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6317e3e946e75f00a574ff9e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3691160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ba Nhang","original_name":"Ba Nhang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6317e3f840d0fe0099bb62b9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3691161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tư Lê","original_name":"Tư Lê","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6317e436924ce6007ab4b8c6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3691162,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chín Sâm","original_name":"Chín Sâm","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6317e448f6fd18007af975c1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3691163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tám Ngân","original_name":"Tám Ngân","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6317e45740d0fe0099bb62fd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3691164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Năm Xế","original_name":"Năm Xế","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6317e4631d1bf4009037ff48","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3691165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hai Giò","original_name":"Hai Giò","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6317e471f6fd1800988507ad","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3691166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sáu Phú","original_name":"Sáu Phú","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6317e47891745b0080f457f3","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3691158,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Thierry","original_name":"Paul Thierry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6317e3938d77c4007bca572e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/upDsWNg8yvsukxSaqY4FSLkyqnX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1924-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
