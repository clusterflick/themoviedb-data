Navigating narrow streets and dark alleys, he embarks on an emotional and mental journey reflective of his reality and that of Shillong. Shem navigates the city of Shillong in the far flung North East India- an area rife with acute race tensions and an even more diverse cultural identity as compared to the rest of the country. Like the quintessential flaneur, he manoeuvres the real and the imaginable to further complicate the personal, the political and the emotional.","popularity":0.0845,"poster_path":"/wU5Pd2KcPbQljUAhrgLmvPWSpNO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2019-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Because There Are No Secrets In Shillong","title":"Lorni - The Flaneur","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adil Hussain","original_name":"Adil Hussain","popularity":2.2044,"profile_path":"/eCWVa1pH7mmz0i9Q0l4VEKs7g6m.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Shem","credit_id":"6317a016bf7744007cf39b68","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3690872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Poonam Agarwal","original_name":"Poonam Agarwal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6317a039ed2ac2007fb5d269","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3690873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizer Bareh","original_name":"Elizer Bareh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jay","credit_id":"6317a049fac502007c34edaf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3690874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deihokhlang Basaiawmoit","original_name":"Deihokhlang Basaiawmoit","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6317a06546e75f00a574f18d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3661358,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sumir Dewri","original_name":"Sumir Dewri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6317a24740d0fe0080c01cd5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3690875,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wanphrang Diengdoh","original_name":"Wanphrang Diengdoh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6317a1d7fac50200a2c0b8a3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3690875,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wanphrang Diengdoh","original_name":"Wanphrang Diengdoh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6317a09bd2b209008178f8ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3690889,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nishit Mistry","original_name":"Nishit Mistry","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6317a34c8ddc340098f6b0eb","department":"Editing","job":"Digital Intermediate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3690875,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wanphrang Diengdoh","original_name":"Wanphrang Diengdoh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6317a0b18ac3d000992cfeb5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2222170,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Devanshi Desai","original_name":"Devanshi Desai","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6317a275aad9c2007ac5f193","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3551791,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Papu Deka","original_name":"Papu Deka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6317a0fe22931a007fb8cc49","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13038150","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2400,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wU5Pd2KcPbQljUAhrgLmvPWSpNO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1696}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Tallin Black Nights Film Festival","release_date":"2019-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"SonyLiv","release_date":"2022-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Lorni-the Flaneur (TRAILER)","key":"qnmoWhcHtd0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-08-29T19:32:31.000Z","id":"63179f6091745b0080f448d7"}]}}}
