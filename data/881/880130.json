He returned a year later to lie with his camera on the spot where she died, and to roam the neighbourhood searching for footage. As remarkable as the girl’s sudden death was, the young filmmaker also found it devastatingly normal. He’d, \"already seen it, thousands of times.\" '18,000 Dead in Gordon Head' is a treatise on the omnipresence of violence in contemporary culture, even (or some would say especially) in the banal context of a Canadian suburb. Composed as a poem, the final work is a hybrid of several film stocks and video formats, processed to create a kinetic, lyrical collage of textures, loops, rhythms and visual rhymes, and in the end finally completing the work’s cycle back to its originally intended film format.","popularity":0.0434,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"18,000 Dead in Gordon Head","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3255514,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clive Holden","original_name":"Clive Holden","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66395580358da701275701e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0370240","wikidata_id":"Q4553720","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ann Arbor Film Festival","release_date":"2003-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
