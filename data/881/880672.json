From his point of view, this means of transportation is mechanically, acustically and optically closely connected with his analogous filmpictures in motion. As a continuation of this analogy, \"MOTOR\" works as a sequence of several different habour settings in the West of France, where the mechanical process of filming takes place. For the sound Andreas Gogol uses analogously produced sound structures and freely associates into the acustic spaces. Even though sound and image of \"MOTOR\" can exist alone, one and one in the ongoing teamwork is three, not two... \"MOTOR\" is also a continuation of the film performance \" Landed Takes & Sound Times\" for which Andreas Gogol and Telemach Wiesinger won the team work award in the 20th \"Stuttgarter Filmwinter\"(2007).","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Motor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1476211,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Telemach Wiesinger","original_name":"Telemach Wiesinger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6159285ff1759c0088eff318","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
