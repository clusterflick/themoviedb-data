'The Quay Co-op' has a fascinating story to tell about the individuals and groups who wanted to see Ireland become a more progressive society in terms of women's rights, LGBTQ rights, and other social justice issues. Through interviews with founding members and other activists, we learn about the early days of the Co-op, what it meant to work co-operatively for change, and how the food business managed not only to survive but thrive. A remarkable change has occurred in Ireland in a relatively short space of time and we discover the pivotal role the Quay Co-op played in that transformation.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/seMQDuFyAqpkELwEff2AtVeLUQ0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Quay Co-Op","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3096805,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emma Bowell","original_name":"Emma Bowell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615883ee93828e002ac364b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3096807,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Eddie Noonan","original_name":"Eddie Noonan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615883c2f1759c00614d63ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15538400","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.657,"height":1089,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/seMQDuFyAqpkELwEff2AtVeLUQ0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":715}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
