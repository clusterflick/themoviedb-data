A rewriting? A remaking? A repeating? A reliving?  Trannies Revenge tells the story of a young trans woman who kills herself, as a result of the torment she faces in the world. She is found by her friend who vows to take revenge for her untimely death.  Oscillating between imaginary poetic spaces and the harsh reality of words, Trannies Revenge considers how language materialises in the world. It questions the responsibility we bear for the reality that we experience and our roles in creating transformation within our communities and wider society. Part tragicomedy, part deluded fantasy - it is a lyrical constellation of life, death, spirit and sound.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/sdwEee16Sw6naA5WRGKBfz5AK9D.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trannies Revenge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2135028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isobel Arnberg","original_name":"Isobel Arnberg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6164a98696033100447ef45a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3267582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salome Mallari","original_name":"Salome Mallari","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6164a99150733c002ab5112a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3256583,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Rimmel","original_name":"Anna Rimmel","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61589a3069eb90004203b037","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3267586,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jašia Rabiej","original_name":"Jašia Rabiej","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6164ac5753866e0093bf0cb8","department":"Sound","job":"Music Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3267583,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Harry Kalfayan","original_name":"Harry Kalfayan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6164a9a453866e0048a5cf8d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1086,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sdwEee16Sw6naA5WRGKBfz5AK9D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":724}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
