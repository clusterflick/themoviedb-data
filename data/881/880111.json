They are the children of Muscovites who were repressed in the 30s and 40s of the last century. There are not many of them, only about 1,500 left for the whole country. All their lives, the “children of the GULAG” have been living in exile, although their parents have been officially rehabilitated, and the law guarantees them the right to return to their former place of residence. In 2019, they won the case in the Constitutional Court, but the State Duma is in no hurry to amend the legislation, and the government proposes to stand in the general queue for housing and wait another 30 years. Meanwhile, every month the number of children in the Gulag is decreasing.","popularity":0.0654,"poster_path":"/vWsilUCzRzb6fsW0jGssnNKwyH6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161938,"logo_path":null,"name":"Romb Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2021-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children of the GULAG","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Deti GULAGa","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2352829,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zaka Abdrakhmanova","original_name":"Зака Абдрахманова","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":"/aJHPWVrKvYka9oP5mvLIuwK0OpR.jpg","credit_id":"6157715581c7be008e0ea835","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2352829,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zaka Abdrakhmanova","original_name":"Зака Абдрахманова","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":"/aJHPWVrKvYka9oP5mvLIuwK0OpR.jpg","credit_id":"6158f3f0eb14fa0043dabf67","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2352829,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zaka Abdrakhmanova","original_name":"Зака Абдрахманова","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":"/aJHPWVrKvYka9oP5mvLIuwK0OpR.jpg","credit_id":"6158f3f6d71fb400232ad4b9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2252877,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Oksana Serbinova","original_name":"Oksana Serbinova","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6158f3ffdd731b008b93e70c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vWsilUCzRzb6fsW0jGssnNKwyH6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
