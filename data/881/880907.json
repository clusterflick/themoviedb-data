Militza escapes to the country village of Marienhagen, finding shelter in the house of a local Catholic priest. The priest also falls for Militza. When he is subsequently struck dead by a bolt of lightning one evening during Mass, his mother blames Militza and has her cast out of the village. Militza joins a theatrical troupe whose married leader is disappointed with the general lack of artistic talent and begs Militza to leave with him.  Militza refuses, and instead flees on her own. Onboard a ship, she is surprised to encounter the leader of the troupe again. The ship sinks, he dies. She is rescued by a nobleman who takes her to his country estate. Here she finds peace and true love. When the dead priest’s vengeful mother learns that Militza is alive, she kindles fear and superstition among the villagers, who stone Militza to death.","popularity":0.0793,"poster_path":"/i7FHihlZ8txPqXZr4wRWLtVinLg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12950,"logo_path":null,"name":"Projektions-AG Union","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1919-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Superstition","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Superstition","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Superstition","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Janson","original_name":"Victor Janson","popularity":0.0654,"profile_path":"/jmjkAwDfzOFMyDcyYYsaBl99NFS.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"615b7cfd172d7f006638bbe9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2403091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peggy Longard","original_name":"Peggy Longard","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"615b7d02d144430088c9e3f9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1343729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johannes Müller","original_name":"Johannes Müller","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"615b7d2bdff66e0092f3a99e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":48062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frida Richard","original_name":"Frida Richard","popularity":0.2271,"profile_path":"/vr9HYBLk5G8xWlFLKwyqClAT5Gx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"615b7d31d1444300436115de","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1930321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellen Richter","original_name":"Ellen Richter","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":"/A5A4nGJD67uR4Y3eBeZpooeAKqG.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"615b7d366ee3d7008d20147d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3258992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frieda Richter","original_name":"Frieda Richter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"615b7d3cc8a2d40043c2a44b","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48035,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georg Jacoby","original_name":"Georg Jacoby","popularity":0.1048,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615b7d480c12550029f0ff92","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13879,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Friedrich Weinmann","original_name":"Friedrich Weinmann","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615b7d516ee3d7008d20149c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48035,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georg Jacoby","original_name":"Georg Jacoby","popularity":0.1048,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615b86dedff66e0062352ee3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1385191,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Willi Wolff","original_name":"Willi Wolff","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615b86e8d14443002c0abc49","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0439109","wikidata_id":"Q60738084","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":2781,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i7FHihlZ8txPqXZr4wRWLtVinLg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1858}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":215678,"name":"partially lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1919-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
