Thousands of people are still in prisons, tens of thousands were forced to go abroad. Among the new emigrants there are politicians, they are even called the government in exile. And there are ordinary citizens who could not even imagine that they would ever have to leave their homeland. The film tells how this Belarus lives, a huge community of migrants that has emerged over the past year. The stories of the heroes add up to a chronicle of what is happening in their country after the elections on August 9,
