This was done by local residents who did not remove the corpses of animals from the streets of Makhachkala and Kaspiysk. It turned out that there is not a single shelter for homeless animals in the republic, but Ali Kurbanov, a resident of Pervomayskoye village, has been keeping dogs at home and on the hillside near the village for many years. Some of them are homeless mongrels, some are wolfhounds involved in dog fights. Sergey Khazov-Kassia and Andrey Kostyanov visited Kurbanov and his dogs.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dogs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2181071,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergey Hazov-Kassia","original_name":"Sergey Hazov-Kassia","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":"/yjj4NvtkqY7YvNDANTdrcXOXmgN.jpg","credit_id":"6157ba3b156cc7009402fae5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
