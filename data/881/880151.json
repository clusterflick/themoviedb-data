Нарко-Атлетико","overview":"In 1989, Pablo Escobar entered the top ten richest people on the planet according to Forbes magazine. He led the Medellin drug cartel for 20 years and, according to some estimates, during his activity he transferred $ 25 billion worth of cocaine to the United States and other countries. In the 70s, Escobar literally covered the streets of America with cocaine. Demand was phenomenal, profits skyrocketed. At one point, the Medellin cartel controlled up to 80% of the world's cocaine turnover. Approximately 70 tons per month were shipped to the USA alone. At that time, Colombia was covered by a football wave. The national team was one of the best on the continent in the early 90s. But how did it happen that in a country where elementary problems have not been solved, football came out on top? Why is this possible? This is the story of how one of the most famous criminals in the history of mankind gave a boost to Colombian football and changed its face forever.","popularity":0.0361,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pablo Escobar.
