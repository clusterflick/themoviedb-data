Seven stairs that lead to the origin of Art. Seven circles of hell that Dante must cross. Seven days for Luisa before the Rimbaud Award deadline. Seven infernal days to seek her doubts, her struggles, her price, her dreams, her madness, Art itself. Seven days to write a poem forged from fragments of her own misery, blood of her own blood. Seven steps along the road from Hell to thus take wing and reach the crown of creation.","popularity":0.0475,"poster_path":"/j3uroWQy9v29EK68iRJ8bn2WTbx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Catarsis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3256762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ángel Fernández Santos","original_name":"Ángel Fernández Santos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6158dbae81c7be0043a6a0c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0466366","wikidata_id":"Q65159034","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1428,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/j3uroWQy9v29EK68iRJ8bn2WTbx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
