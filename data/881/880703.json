He has been grounded ever since he came home from Hollywood: he is not allowed to leave his room, go out with friends, spend holidays with family members, etc. He is also still very upset over the death of Matt. Even worse, his really mean uncle visits him every week so his aunt can have psychological meetings with Lloyd. During one of these meetings, she tells Lloyd to write about his own utopian society, and what it would look like. One night, Lloyd gets the idea to use a magic MacGuffin to make his own utopian reality come true, where he is the leader of the world. All this happens, and he is now respected and loved by everyone! However, everything might not be as perfect as it seems, as something suspicious is going on that Lloyd doesnâ€™t notice. Lloyd has to make a decision: protect the world for the well-being of others, or take matters into his own hands, while potentially harming himself in the process.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pop Culture Kid Movie 2: Pop Culture Society","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
