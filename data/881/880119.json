The new inhabitants of the presidential palace promise not to commit genocide and assure that they are not the same as in the 90s. But nobody believes their words. Why has Afghanistan turned into a Taliban republic again and how will the lives of ordinary Afghans now change? Why should we be worried about what is happening in this distant country?","popularity":0.0621,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2021-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":131,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Graveyard of Empires: Why the Taliban Turns Out Stronger Than the USA","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"War in Afghanistan: Reporting from Kabul","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Kladbishche imperiy: kak «Taliban» okazalsya silneye SSHA","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3255497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilya Varlamov","original_name":"Ilya Varlamov","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":"/xvEQHuWj5fBe7mbB55pLFdhSOmX.jpg","credit_id":"6157776bdd731b0029bb74df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3256899,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alexey Soloukhin","original_name":"Alexey Soloukhin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6158f8bdc8a2d4008c74936c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3256897,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ivan Matushkin","original_name":"Ivan Matushkin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6158f8a4b1f68d0027505b5f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3256903,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vitaly Krylov","original_name":"Vitaly Krylov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6158f8f269eb900061d3a23c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3255671,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maya Volf","original_name":"Maya Volf","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6158f8dc69eb90002a25d9a4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
