Telemach Wiesinger visited waterfronts in France, Germany, England, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and the U.S.A. to make a note of historic swing- and lift bridges, the last hovercrafts and the gigantic ship hoists by means of moving images. Many masterpieces of bridge construction from the heyday of ship- and railway constructions are nowadays dismantled or fall into ruins. These technical dinosaurs become a document and an allegory of Wiesinger’s timeless imagination of travel. The sound film „PASSAGE“ is his second collaboration with composer and multi-instrumentalist Tobias Schwab. The musical collage is used to reflect the cinematic language of Wiesinger and to mirror his mechanical film tools.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Passage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1476211,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Telemach Wiesinger","original_name":"Telemach Wiesinger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615926a11c635b00447f016e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
