Partly inspired by the Doukhobors’ (a 17th-century Christian sect in Poland) Living Book, Erin Cosgrove’s film also draws on such diverse source material as string-theory, science fiction, and religious history. Meditative and humorous, the film confronts its overtly broad theme within the frame of an ongoing argument between two lifetime intimates.","popularity":0.0629,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
