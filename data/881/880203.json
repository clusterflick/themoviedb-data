Criminal? Dangerous sick person? Or a hero fighting the worst enemy? It is customary to treat drug addicts as the scum of society, unnecessary and superfluous. But it's not just weak people who start using drugs. Very often, especially in childhood, drugs appear in life as a tool of socialization. Using the example of a personal story of one person, the author tells how people in Russia treat drug addicts, what stereotypes they have to face, whether they manage to start a new life and whether there is a share of responsibility of each of us in the problem of drug addiction.","popularity":0.0718,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2021-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Man Captured by Drugs: The Story of an Addicted Soul","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Chelovek v plenu u narkotikov: istoriya zavisimoy dushi","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3255671,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maya Volf","original_name":"Maya Volf","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6157b578eb14fa00627e3363","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3255671,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maya Volf","original_name":"Maya Volf","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61598ad6eb14fa006281cc37","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3257296,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kir Agashkov","original_name":"Kir Agashkov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61598ac31c635b00630655ae","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3256897,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ivan Matushkin","original_name":"Ivan Matushkin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61598ab91c635b002a1f1264","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3256903,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vitaly Krylov","original_name":"Vitaly Krylov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61598adf1c635b00447f7ecc","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-03-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
