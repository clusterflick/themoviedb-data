Situating archival film in parallel with reenactment, the film conjures up New York’s Lower East Side in the early years of the twentieth century, it centers on a real storefront cinema, Frank Seiden’s Variety Theater. Here silent movies were anything but. Frank and his sons improvised dialog for the films and sang Yiddish ballads to an audience that didn’t hesitate to join in or argue back. It was a welcoming space for women and the film follows a group of radical young garment workers who gather here to figure out how to fight for women’s rights and change their world.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":222961,"logo_path":null,"name":"Besties Make Movies","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2026-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life Forgotten","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1434355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Valk","original_name":"Kate Valk","popularity":0.3662,"profile_path":"/8LOCLOCyDYq6ubAidVL40Cowv8r.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Sarah Adler","credit_id":"696beb28673d90fa8a36a901","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5945912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ariel Shafir","original_name":"Ariel Shafir","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Frank Seiden","credit_id":"696beb434505048d2bdcacf1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5945922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Perez","original_name":"Maria Perez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Clara Lemlich","credit_id":"696bec5681576167bff11a2b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5650925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Spencer Quartin","original_name":"Spencer Quartin","popularity":0.0973,"profile_path":"/eBnN89yY8LBx3Q4yghifd3a3Dbu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Joe Seiden","credit_id":"696bec718cd0614020689a39","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5945929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lexie Waddy","original_name":"Lexie Waddy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Pauline","credit_id":"696bed29962775e541aaa407","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1607683,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zoe Beloff","original_name":"Zoe Beloff","popularity":0.1015,"profile_path":"/w278aEfkKp3vPYvHDZRnPqBphhl.jpg","credit_id":"696bec898b9d779b89f119c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1607683,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zoe Beloff","original_name":"Zoe Beloff","popularity":0.1015,"profile_path":"/w278aEfkKp3vPYvHDZRnPqBphhl.jpg","credit_id":"696bec91eafe7e3224f119f5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1835618,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stacey Maltin","original_name":"Stacey Maltin","popularity":0.2137,"profile_path":"/myprWdbAFjcPV76sHBOIb3lkR6Z.jpg","credit_id":"696becbe02dfc384f18fc907","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1611389,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Eric Muzzy","original_name":"Eric Muzzy","popularity":0.0504,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696bece42a2c6acab1dcae50","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1611389,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Eric Muzzy","original_name":"Eric Muzzy","popularity":0.0504,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696becf3def51f090f7f9c76","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1607683,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zoe Beloff","original_name":"Zoe Beloff","popularity":0.1015,"profile_path":"/w278aEfkKp3vPYvHDZRnPqBphhl.jpg","credit_id":"696bed043ec6cbdd55aaa468","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5945931,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ira Temple","original_name":"Ira Temple","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696bed4d13d53d4c2edcae9f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33378223","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2026-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
