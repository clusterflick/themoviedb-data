Technically, these worms do not use viruses; they trick users into granting \"Broad Consent\" to a malicious helper app. When Norton's Identity Shield attempts to block the unauthorized \"Token Export,\" it conflicts with the Windows Credential Guard, causing the security engine to crash. This leaves the system \"Green\" but the Cloud Identity Protection is internally dead.\r Advanced Restoration Protocols:\r OAuth Token Revocation: Use the Norton dashboard to force-invalidate all \"Session Tokens\" and remove unauthorized SaaS app permissions.\r Heap Memory Expansion: Increase the Windows desktop heap size to prevent the 8504 rendering deadlock during identity scans.\r Credential Manager Purge: Clear the Windows Vault of all cached 2026 web credentials to break the worm's persistence loop.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Texas Enterprise: Fixing Norton \"Error 8504, 104\" and OAuth Worm Injections","title":"Texas Enterprise: Fixing Norton \"Error 8504, 104\" and OAuth Worm Injections","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
