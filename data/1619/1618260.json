Technically, this is an I/O Priority Deadlock. The Bitdefender Active Threat Control enters a recursive scanning loop on large cloud-synced files or temporary browser data. This creates a massive queue in the Disk Controller, causing the main service (vsserv.exe) to time out and stop responding to the UI.\r Advanced Restoration Protocols:\r VSS Writer Reset: Use the vssadmin command to reset the Volume Shadow Copy writers that often trigger these locks.\r Disk I/O Throttling: Adjust the Bitdefender scan priority to \"Background\" to prevent it from seizing 100% of your SSD resources.\r Encrypted Web Scan Reset: Flush the Bitdefender SSL certificates to resolve Port 443 handshake delays that hang the service.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Florida Security Alert: Resolving Bitdefender \"Services Not Responding\" Loop","title":"Florida Security Alert: Resolving Bitdefender \"Services Not Responding\" Loop","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
