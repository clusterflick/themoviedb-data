All of the photographs and footage in this film were captured throughout 2025. While much of my work this year lived within the ‘Summer in the City’ project, this film focuses on what unfolded outside of those months. It represents another year of walking, observing, and paying attention to the city as it shifts with time and season.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/gXYFrH5DOGAaFLtshUxF2DnXC0l.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinematic Reality: NYC 2025","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5941449,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Szpot","original_name":"Mike Szpot","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696cc6f413d53d4c2edcb32c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.753,"height":1700,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gXYFrH5DOGAaFLtshUxF2DnXC0l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
