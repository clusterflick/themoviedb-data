Technically, these worms do not use passwords. They trick a user into granting \"Broad Consent\" to a malicious Helper App in Microsoft 365. Once authorized, the worm pivots across your SaaS stack (Slack, Salesforce) using legitimate OAuth Tokens. Traditional antivirus cannot see this because no \"Malware File\" is ever saved to the disk.\r Advanced Restoration Protocols:\r OAuth Token Revocation: Use the Cloud Admin console to instantly revoke all \"High-Risk\" app permissions across the tenant.\r Consent Governance Setup: Implement a \"Strict Consent\" policy that requires hardware-key (MFA) approval for any new SaaS-to-SaaS connection.\r Token Refresh: Force-log out of all devices to invalidate the \"Stolen\" session tokens used by the worm.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"New York Business Guide: Resolving \"OAuth Worm\" and SaaS-to-SaaS Hijacks","title":"New York Business Guide: Resolving \"OAuth Worm\" and SaaS-to-SaaS Hijacks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
