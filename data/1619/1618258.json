Technically, this is a COM (Component Object Model) interface failure. When McAfee attempts to call a specific DLL (like McProxy.dll) to handle network filtering, the Windows Registry fails to provide the class ID. This is often caused by interrupted 2026 Windows 11 updates that \"orphaned\" the registry keys, leaving McAfee's UI unable to communicate with the scanning engine.\r Advanced Restoration Protocols:\r Regsvr32 Component Re-registration: Open an elevated CMD and manually register the McAfee core DLLs to restore the COM handshake.\r DISM Image Repair: Run DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth to fix the underlying Windows component store that McAfee relies on.\r WMI Namespace Reset: Rebuild the WMI repository to allow Windows Security Center to properly recognize and launch McAfee services.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"California Tech Alert: Resolving McAfee \"Error 0x80040154\" and DLL Registry Corruption","title":"California Tech Alert: Resolving McAfee \"Error 0x80040154\" and DLL Registry Corruption","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
