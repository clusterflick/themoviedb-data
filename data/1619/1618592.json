The documentary follows McRoberts as he commits to learning te reo Maori and reconnects with his Ngāti Kahungunu roots. In his public role as a polished newsreader, McRoberts hid his whakamā (shame) at not speaking te reo and being a 'real' Maori. His whānau discuss their mixed heritage and the racism their parents experienced as a couple. McRoberts' emotional exploration of his identity includes receiving a tā moko and delivering his first whaikōrero (te reo speech) on his father's marae.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Maori","iso_639_1":"mi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kia Ora, Good Evening","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22353306","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
