Technically, this is an MFT (Master File Table) conflict. TotalAV’s \"Smart Scan\" attempts to index every file handle on the drive. In Arizona's high-heat environments, this intense I/O causes Thermal Throttling, where the hardware slows down significantly to prevent melting, leading to a completely frozen system.\r Advanced Restoration Protocols:\r MFT Optimization: Run chkdsk /f to repair file table inconsistencies that slow down the scan engine.\r I/O Scheduling Override: Change the TotalAV scan priority to \"Idle\" via the advanced configuration menu to reduce stress.\r Temp Cache Purge: Delete the AppData\\Local\\Temp contents to remove \"Scanning Traps\" that cause the 100% disk loop.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Arizona Infrastructure Guide: Resolving TotalAV \"High Disk Usage\" & Thermal Spikes","title":"Arizona Infrastructure Guide: Resolving TotalAV \"High Disk Usage\" & Thermal Spikes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
