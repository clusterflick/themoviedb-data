Surprisingly, he discovers that no one cares who he is and what he has done. Emerging from his dirty basement, Leon realizes that the FBI has stopped looking for him and that President Carter has granted an amnesty. The old companions have become employees, their only \"commitment\" is now the family. The students of the universities refuse any political appeal. During an incredible party, given in his honor, Leon accuses his old friends of having stopped worrying, they tell him that life is much more complex than they believed in their youth. Having cut his hair, Leon also looks for a job. What he will be able to find, however, is the surprise of the last lines of the film.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/rgs00lghMAyrjwU0O9KTPC8ix7q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10250,"logo_path":null,"name":"UCLA School of Film and Television","origin_country":"US"},{"id":286419,"logo_path":null,"name":"Temple Hill Productions, Inc.","origin_country":""},{"id":283115,"logo_path":null,"name":"Independent Cinema Artists & Producers (ICAP) (Distributor)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Leon's Case","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Diehl","original_name":"John Diehl","popularity":1.2071,"profile_path":"/fSaOexgc31Xmp4koMu0HvlkJMr4.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Leon Bernstein","credit_id":"696aabe0d01b2f4ea0e1f434","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":133581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Gaul","original_name":"Patricia Gaul","popularity":0.9242,"profile_path":"/5ncPdor53GdBO5gnnBdbmI1WjJj.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Karen","credit_id":"696aabee3e488979f0ad1b82","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":157169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Allport","original_name":"Christopher Allport","popularity":0.6375,"profile_path":"/zmPu6I56j0EBEAWp6QW3nq9DxDg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Keith","credit_id":"696aac1b7241fd6760bf29f5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":69597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Drew Barrymore","original_name":"Drew Barrymore","popularity":4.162,"profile_path":"/9xMu2GLC5otUcC11sEWC5aEAERQ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jenny","credit_id":"696aac2a36b989aa1c89af84","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5944013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Stuart","original_name":"Steve Stuart","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Copy Store Attendant","credit_id":"696aac68771d1c7e1bcc61ef","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1213773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Keep Mills","original_name":"Stephen Keep Mills","popularity":0.5795,"profile_path":"/6PNZfzOsPotBuvnAzsTuHX2LByU.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Rydell","credit_id":"696aacc83e1f983eb66d3f0b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry G.
