When MI6 uncovers evidence of an illegal plutonium purification operation hidden within a quiet North Essex school, two unsuspecting students are recruited for a covert mission. Posing as ordinary pupils, they must infiltrate the site, gather proof, and dismantle the scheme before it reaches a critical stage. But the deeper they go, the more dangerous the truth becomes - as they uncover a pair of ruthless brothers, suspected to be the architects of the operation, working from the shadows. With the threat of exposure-and detonation-hanging over them, the clock is ticking fast. They have 30 minutes to get out alive.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"30 Minutes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Pegg","original_name":"Simon Pegg","popularity":3.1376,"profile_path":"/jw8bEEoTOithyNf0qxu4Zt1yaKp.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator / Benji Dunn","credit_id":"696bc13b983151f7fb7f9a41","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5945583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Brown","original_name":"George Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Robert Windsor","credit_id":"696bc156def51f090f7f9b9d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5945591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Razzell","original_name":"James Razzell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Tom Kemp","credit_id":"696bc1c7695591492c20c9c8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5945592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louie Moran","original_name":"Louie Moran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Hugo Bateman","credit_id":"696bc1df4b9aaafb8cf11796","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5945601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Pieri","original_name":"Alex Pieri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Alex Spoude","credit_id":"696bc28affe2948aa420c814","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5945580,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Norman","original_name":"Sam Norman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696bc102793a230f3ef117d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37424284","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
