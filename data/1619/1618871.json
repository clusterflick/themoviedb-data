The folding chair has since become not only a meme but a symbol of black self-defense. The presence of the folding chairs in the exhibition are essentially covert weapons, representing the balancing act of being black in white spaces, having to speak a certain way and all that. The chair exists between rest and action, between action and bearing witness, between the viewer and the subject.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/9khfBaxdK9E5Q66LO0awgTQbSq5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Internet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5947037,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Golder-Carpenter","original_name":"Allen Golder-Carpenter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696cb7bb9abcd4249e689ba1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9khfBaxdK9E5Q66LO0awgTQbSq5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Derosia, New York","release_date":"2025-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
