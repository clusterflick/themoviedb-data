Technically, this is caused by Scanning Overlap. If the \"Scheduled Scan\" triggers while the real-time engine is monitoring active 2026 AI-web traffic, the CPU's Interrupt Requests (IRQ) spike. In Arizona’s heat, this leads to Thermal Throttling, where the CPU stays at 100% usage but the PC feels frozen.\r Advanced Restoration Protocols:\r IRQ Priority Re-alignment: Adjust TotalAV’s process priority to \"Low\" to reduce CPU heat generation.\r Scheduled Scan Calibration: Disable \"Scan while Idle\" to prevent background CPU spikes during high Arizona ambient heat.\r Power Option Optimization: Change the Windows Power Plan to \"High Performance\" to prevent the CPU from entering a low-voltage \"lag\" state.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Arizona Performance: Resolving TotalAV \"High CPU Usage\" and Fan Noise","title":"Arizona Performance: Resolving TotalAV \"High CPU Usage\" and Fan Noise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
