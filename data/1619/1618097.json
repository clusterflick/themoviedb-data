Moving between myth and reality, it follows figures such as Bogdan Khmelnytsky, Ukraine, The Witch, The Child, the Refugees, and The Artist, each searching for Ukraine. Through a mythopoetic language, the film reflects on history, war, and cultural memory, offering a poetic meditation on identity, loss, and resilience.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/prBlBuwk5TEkKdikh3M8fbp2hRb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Between Before and After","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5944182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valeriia Berezovska","original_name":"Valeriia Berezovska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Ukraine","credit_id":"696ac99222ef868223827e04","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5944183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andryi Neretin","original_name":"Andryi Neretin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Bohdan Khmelnytsky","credit_id":"696ac9b57702d7ba17412550","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5944184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Palii","original_name":"Ivan Palii","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"The Child","credit_id":"696ac9c71fd296765c5d45c3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5944185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Ivanova","original_name":"Olga Ivanova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"The Witch","credit_id":"696ac9deb3e8a2beec827e5b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5582770,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marichka Lukianchuk","original_name":"Marichka Lukianchuk","popularity":0.2056,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"The Artist","credit_id":"696ac9f3a3c8a7ee5710b5cf","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5944186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margo","original_name":"Margo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"The Artist’s Dog","credit_id":"696aca0c6ab660fc13094d12","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5944188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Parez","original_name":"Parez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Horse with assistance of Tamara Bujarski","credit_id":"696aca1f963c17f6a3094d56","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5582770,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marichka Lukianchuk","original_name":"Marichka Lukianchuk","popularity":0.2056,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696ac939decd1ae0b3d935c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5944189,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Dayana Mankovska","original_name":"Dayana Mankovska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696aca454e3ffa50505a1160","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5944190,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Joanna Skupinska","original_name":"Joanna Skupinska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696aca69deb5c659e2d935c8","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5944191,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Denys Sadoviy","original_name":"Denys Sadoviy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696aca7d4e3ffa50505a116e","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5944192,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Virginie Perne","original_name":"Virginie Perne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696aca99168cd455df171713","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2902,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/prBlBuwk5TEkKdikh3M8fbp2hRb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1958}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"16+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"uk","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
