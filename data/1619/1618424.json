In the animated film on the subject of collective farming, the Soviet ideology and agitation-propaganda are conveyed with scarce artistic methods and posters characteristic of the epoch. In a propaganda animated film, the director creates a visual statistical picture of the collective farms of each region throughout Soviet Georgia with the constant rhetoric: \"The kulak is the enemy of  the poor man!\" \"Collectivization demands!\" It is demonstrated by the example of a common peasant how difficult it is to work alone with the land, and the only \"correct\" way is to coexist with your own work and land through collective farming. The final frame of the animation is also an echo of the Soviet propaganda poster of the 1930s, with the text: \"Citizen! What part do you take in the sowing campaign?!\"","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":186508,"logo_path":"/dONUQvMFW5X8DCw6nX9Dk26TQwF.png","name":"Georgia-Film","origin_country":"SU"},{"id":101993,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goskino","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":193507,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goskinprom Gruzii (Dublicate)","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1930-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gazapkhuli","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0781029","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1930-01-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
