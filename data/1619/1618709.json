Nestled in the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains at the cut of Cats' Canyon, Los Gatos attracted gold diggers, lumberjacks, oil drillers, outlaws and artists. Witness the celebrations and tragedies of young frontier town - the devastating fires that forged its features, the ebullient parades, picnics and pageants that signaled its joy, the notorious crimes that darken its past, and the remarkable innovators who found inspiration in the lovely landscape.  Rare film footage from the early twentieth century shows a stagecoach rumbling along Old Santa Cruz highway, trolley trundling through town, travelers at the train depot, and automobiles racing along the new, sixteen foot wide \"Boulevard to the Pacific.\"","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Los Gatos: Then and Now","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
