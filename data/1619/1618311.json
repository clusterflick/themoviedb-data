Technically, this occurs when employees use unmonitored AI tools (like unauthorized LLMs) to process sensitive company data. Attackers use Prompt Injection or Model Hijacking to trick these unmonitored AI agents into leaking your proprietary code or customer PII. This creates a \"Fileless Data Breach\" that bypasses traditional network firewalls.\r Advanced Restoration Protocols:\r AI Traffic Audit: Use a specialized NPU (Neural Processing Unit) Monitor to identify unauthorized AI API calls originating from your network.\r LLM Sandbox Reset: Purge the local AI-cache and browser \"IndexedDB\" to remove sensitive prompts that may be cached in the memory.\r Prompt Guard Implementation: Install a 2026-compliant \"AI Firewall\" to filter outbound data before it reaches public LLM servers.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Texas Infrastructure: Fixing \"Shadow AI\" Data Leaks and Model Hijacking","title":"Texas Infrastructure: Fixing \"Shadow AI\" Data Leaks and Model Hijacking","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
