This profoundly moving documentary tells the personal stories of adoptive families and reveals the veiled back story of those who loved these children first; the biological parents who feel they can't keep their children and the orphanage nannies or foster-families who must say goodbye to the children they've raised for moths... or years.  The film exemplifies the great love and personal sacrifice of all those who care for these precious little ones and gives a glimpse into the lives of those who have answered the quiet cry of China that says, find me.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Adoption love stories... from their arms to ours","title":"Find Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
