Technically, these are Multimodal AI Phishing campaigns where an attacker uses a real-time AI-cloned voice and video to impersonate an executive during a Zoom or Teams call. The goal is to trick employees into authorized OAuth Token Export or large wire transfers. Because the attacker uses a \"Live\" identity, standard signature-based antivirus cannot detect the threat.\r Advanced Restoration Protocols:\r Multimodal Audit: Use the 2026 Identity Verification Module to analyze audio-video latency for synthetic artifacts (metallic echoes or frame jitter).\r Session Token Flush: Immediately revoke all active web sessions to invalidate any \"Stolen\" OAuth tokens captured during the deepfake interaction.\r Biometric Lock: Implement a \"Hardware Security Key\" requirement for any high-value transaction initiated via video call.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"California Executive Guide: Resolving \"CEO Doppelgänger\" Deepfake Phishing","title":"California Executive Guide: Resolving \"CEO Doppelgänger\" Deepfake Phishing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
