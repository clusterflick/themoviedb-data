As founder of Hadassah, builder of a modern healthcare and social service system in pre-state Israel, and fierce advocate for education and Jewish–Arab cooperation, Henrietta Szold was a force of nature who galvanized a global network of Jewish women. Her boldest achievement, Youth Aliyah, rescued thousands of Jewish children from Nazi-occupied Europe. Through archival footage, intimate letters, and firsthand reflections lifted by Tovah Feldshuh’s stirring narration, this rousing tribute honors a trailblazer whose moral clarity, courage, and humanity continue to echo today.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Labors of Love: The Life and Legacy of Henrietta Szold","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1477623,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abby Ginzberg","original_name":"Abby Ginzberg","popularity":0.1279,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696a8f49409335e1782b9343","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
