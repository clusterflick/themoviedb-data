His shattered peace is violently interrupted by Santos, a criminal from his past who made a deal for his family's safety—a deal Max failed to honor. After a brutal, fatal confrontation in a car, 3 years later Max is kidnapped and beaten in an abandoned house where he learns Santos survived and that his family was killed as retribution. Fueled by a toxic cocktail of painkillers and survival instinct, Max unleashes his signature slow-motion fury to fight his way through Santos' thugs where a final desperate shootout pushes both him and Santos to their absolute limits, forcing Max to confront the inescapable, violent cycle his actions have created.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/gMZGlYRxuVXRhK7yNSBO1ayH2W8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":261687,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shadowscape Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"survive a final, brutal reckoning.","title":"Max Payne: Broken Promises","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3256218,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Savage","original_name":"Lee Savage","popularity":0.089,"profile_path":"/pqpAcxGzv8Qykgsw7ZA6Gz3yLXe.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Max Payne","credit_id":"696c0c18cb195c9856f11ac7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4235725,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Alejandro Gigena Kazimierczak","original_name":"David Alejandro Gigena Kazimierczak","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Santos","credit_id":"696c0c30e3900670eeaaa4f6","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2239454,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Logan Wilson","original_name":"Logan Wilson","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/bVNEkyNXvRsIRIzCQ24pIKHP7co.jpg","credit_id":"696c0c45ea5b2019278fc716","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2239449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phillip Wilson","original_name":"Phillip Wilson","popularity":0.0534,"profile_path":"/p5ousLkBGiL8NUX0EDPAsDldZvT.jpg","credit_id":"696c0c520e3b8c398cf944f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5428074,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Brittany David","original_name":"Brittany David","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696c0c80d190964755689ab7","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Special Effects Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5424191,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Josh Andres","original_name":"Josh Andres","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696c0cad9abcd4249e6898ec","department":"Sound","job":"Music Score Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt39367783","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yDzFZi8ijOUoW9hNhYV7GDpMnV3.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2goocUMVrUa0SuCd7nTokXT7gDj.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hwnYKktiel27tzEqC2pvdGn7trP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2976,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gMZGlYRxuVXRhK7yNSBO1ayH2W8.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":703,"name":"detective"},{"id":13116,"name":"one man army"},{"id":15009,"name":"criminal"},{"id":168713,"name":"neo-western"},{"id":322496,"name":"action"},{"id":365987,"name":"max payne"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
