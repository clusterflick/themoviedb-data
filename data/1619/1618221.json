Through his iconic Folklore Center in Greenwich Village, Izzy offered much more than books, records, and instruments—he created a vibrant hub where aspiring musicians like Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Emmylou Harris, and Patti Smith could perform, learn, and connect. Izzy’s passion for folk music made him a beloved mentor and tastemaker, and when he organized Dylan’s first official concert, his role in shaping the music scene was solidified. Izzy not only nurtured their talents but also helped shape the cultural movement that would define a generation.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Go to Izzy!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
