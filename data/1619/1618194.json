The film chronicles the pursuit of an artistic life; and all the trials, the tribulations, the ups and downs, the luck and serendipity, the disappointments and frustrations that come along with it. Clem Snide’s story embodies a “lower-case-s” spirituality in a universal way. The film documents the touring and promotion of the album Forever Just Beyond. Released on March 29, 2020, the record’s unveiling occurred at the precise moment of the first COVID-19 outbreak across the country. Forever Just Beyond was produced by Scott Avett of The Avett Brothers, who features in the film.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ballad of Clem Snide","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1873029,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eef Barzelay","original_name":"Eef Barzelay","popularity":0.0512,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"696b093333b6dda3196892e8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1071110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Avett","original_name":"Scott Avett","popularity":0.1387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"696b0955e2747dcd7b20c40c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5944555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Burkett","original_name":"John Burkett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696b0988ab924fe47020c499","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5944555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Burkett","original_name":"John Burkett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696b09dc81576167bff1149b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5944555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Burkett","original_name":"John Burkett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696b09f0e2d4a66f7836a40f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5944558,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matt Kelley","original_name":"Matt Kelley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696b0a74cd1084762236a482","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5944559,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peter Himberger","original_name":"Peter Himberger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696b0a9abb1123e50e20c43d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5944559,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peter Himberger","original_name":"Peter Himberger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696b0aac81eab01bebf114dc","department":"Sound","job":"Music Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1545450,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ed Gerrard","original_name":"Ed Gerrard","popularity":0.2691,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696b0ac48b9d779b89f114ae","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1545450,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ed Gerrard","original_name":"Ed Gerrard","popularity":0.2691,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696b0ad32ca1f7733d8fc1de","department":"Sound","job":"Music Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5944561,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Drew Frankel","original_name":"Drew Frankel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696b0ae93f6de5a4fff93f53","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5944561,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Drew Frankel","original_name":"Drew Frankel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696b0afb12fc4be70adca91b","department":"Sound","job":"Music Supervisor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
