From 1907 to 1911, Gustav Mahler reshapes New York’s musical life through bold leadership at both the New York Philharmonic and the Metropolitan Opera, while composing his monumental Symphonies No. 9 and 10. Amid the Upper West Side bustle, he pushes into daring new territory while facing personal tragedy and mounting health challenges. Lush musical performances, rare archival materials, and insights from conductors, scholars, historians, and descendants—including contributions from the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra—illuminate a story of reinvention, belonging, and the ever-resonant power of Mahler’s legacy.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mahler in New York","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3227605,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hilan Warshaw","original_name":"Hilan Warshaw","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":"/60X2Rco9E7Ase6PzrlpRClcchKF.jpg","credit_id":"696a8fe4180db3152c3332dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
