Technically, this is a Runtime Rendering Conflict. Norton’s SymHTML engine, which draws the user interface, conflicts with the DirectX hooks of modern GPU drivers. This \"Race Condition\" results in a memory deadlock in the Non-Paged Pool, causing the Norton service to crash and display a \"Security Engine Failure\" alert.\r Advanced Restoration Protocols:\r DDU Cleanup: Use the Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU) in Safe Mode to clear conflicting graphics residues.\r Norton UI Hook Bypass: Modify the Norton engine settings to use \"Legacy Rendering\" via the internal developer flags.\r Heap Memory Expansion: Increase the Windows desktop heap size to prevent the 8504 error from recurring during high-load tasks.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Texas Performance Guide: Fixing Norton \"Error 8504, 104\" and GPU Driver Conflicts","title":"Texas Performance Guide: Fixing Norton \"Error 8504, 104\" and GPU Driver Conflicts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
