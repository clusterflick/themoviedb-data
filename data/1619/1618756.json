A great musical caravan that moves from stage to stage, concert to concert, from Veneto to Friuli, until it reaches the heart of Sarajevo and brings its musical presence to the city and the refugee camps of Blažuj and Ušivak: music and song as a tool for knowledge and encounter between humanity and cultures in motion, but also as a living testimony of those who have had similar experiences and are part of the multi-ethnic choir Voci dal Mondo in Italy.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/eKZWELbIOZtHgWngHBzbWgVEQjQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":286534,"logo_path":null,"name":"agosto.film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alla ricerca di Simurg, in volo verso la rotta balcanica","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5946696,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincenzo Agosto","original_name":"Vincenzo Agosto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696c62b4c480113d6e689b5e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5946698,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cinzia Ferranti","original_name":"Cinzia Ferranti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696c62cd5133e34b966898be","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5946699,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Domenico Agosto","original_name":"Domenico Agosto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696c63014b9aaafb8cf11a9b","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1402,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eKZWELbIOZtHgWngHBzbWgVEQjQ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":994}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":365992,"name":"simurg"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
