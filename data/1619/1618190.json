When Fung is bequeathed a tattered notebook by his father Lang on his deathbed, his life is turned upside down. Tasked with a heavy undertaking, Fung has to think and look out of the box before rolling up his sleeves to forge the sword. Through the tedious process of annealing and tempering, grinding and cutting, he begins to contemplate the meaning of casting a sword, and of the elusive father and son relationship.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/lQmLIQnGREHgn25Hi17KR1LtjEv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61392,"logo_path":"/e1g54NyBA3ICLice0kKOYHMc84u.png","name":"Fresh
