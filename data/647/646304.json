It was filmed 4-6 April 1990 in the beautiful Baroque Basilica of Waldsassen in Bavaria: a few kilometers from the Czech border. It was filmed just a few months after the Iron Curtain had fallen, a mere 6 months before Bernstein's death on 14 October 1990. His painful, labored breathing is evident during this performance. It is a sad reminder of what is to come and it makes this performance, so other-worldly in many ways, particularly poignant. Bernstein conducts the splendid Chor und Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks.","popularity":0.3756,"poster_path":"/17vSGpCaAr16SVoYqQ4FBlmgn0Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2006-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latin","iso_639_1":"la","name":"Latin"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mozart Great Mass in C Minor; Ave Verum Corpus; Exsultate Jubilate","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9851,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leonard Bernstein","original_name":"Leonard Bernstein","popularity":0.4622,"profile_path":"/gIcYeEYui0CVZ3eDE26iKUeDX6K.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5dc5ac057d2bc100174116f2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2356545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arleen Augér","original_name":"Arleen Augér","popularity":0.0464,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5dc5ac3099259c00137e13e8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Lopardo","original_name":"Frank Lopardo","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/fHgq5OCHOEW8R7yI35L8As0wp1d.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5dc5ac50ab1bc70013ff9fcd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1028317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederica von Stade","original_name":"Frederica von Stade","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/gp6C54Aw1s6kxBm0eFsOyPSWLi.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5dc5ac7799259c00137e159e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1203720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cornelius Hauptmann","original_name":"Cornelius Hauptmann","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5dc5ac8b99259c00137e15cf","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1242372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Humphrey Burton","original_name":"Humphrey Burton","popularity":0.0724,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc5b0086f8d950017c3137d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/17vSGpCaAr16SVoYqQ4FBlmgn0Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":217325,"name":"masses"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"la","note":"","release_date":"2006-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
