After more than a year of investigation in Argentina , in Chile, Brazil, the United States and France, the director collected, sometimes under the cover of a hidden camera, recorded conversations, the exclusive testimonies of the main protagonists. From General Aussaresses to former Minister of the Armed Forces Pierre Messmer, including General Reynaldo Bignone (head of the military junta in Argentina from 1982 to 1984), General Albano Harguindéguy, General Manuel Contreras, and Generals John Johns and Carl Bernard, this investigation gives us a hidden reality of the country of Human Rights.","popularity":0.3595,"poster_path":"/pKcpcnNvSF9B6LjPOooqEn4VM7r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":9116,"logo_path":"/vYeYdFxDWoqBzFgYz2Tf9d2ZseE.png","name":"SODEC","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":10739,"logo_path":null,"name":"Productions
