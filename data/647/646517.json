To take the pulse of the country, the filmmaker adopts one of documentary cinema’s most prolific sub-genres: the train film. Filmed entirely in the old, run-down, overcrowded passenger trains used by ordinary Ukrainians, the film captures conversations, observes the landscape, and accompanies several protagonists on their journey; they open our eyes to popular preoccupations in a country that seems perpetually anchored in its highly visible Soviet legacy. A fine lesson in listening and humanity.","popularity":0.503,"poster_path":"/uHocUVeK6aKMY9y6sagh9pR0L8G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75749,"logo_path":"/j5FhgdD4sSqmJ0kQAk1rDVSVrTe.png","name":"Intuitive Pictures","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2019-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don't Worry, the Doors Will Open","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Не хвилюйся, двері відчиняться","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Ne khvylyuysya, dveri vidchynyatsya","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1667425,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dominique Sicotte","original_name":"Dominique Sicotte","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6518640fc50ad200c91b0b1d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2247277,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Judith Plamondon","original_name":"Judith Plamondon","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651864639b861600acaf6a66","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2044495,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ina Fichman","original_name":"Ina Fichman","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6518643ea199a600ab19291f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2376624,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oksana Karpovych","original_name":"Oksana Karpovych","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/lam4wxi5AAYSqQW4e1HUqrWQbAb.jpg","credit_id":"6518647993bd69011b8dbf99","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4299139,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Christopher Nunn","original_name":"Christopher Nunn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651864b09b861600e2500458","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2247278,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lessandro Sócrates","original_name":"Lessandro Sócrates","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/iSO6qtvuSGcY59Z7MabmhsQZmOC.jpg","credit_id":"63852158229ae21554288d7a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2376624,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oksana Karpovych","original_name":"Oksana Karpovych","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/lam4wxi5AAYSqQW4e1HUqrWQbAb.jpg","credit_id":"5dc6d27e7d2bc10017440233","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11774746","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iw1XVgCsnypmUJRVR3mh6aTHkoG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2400}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uHocUVeK6aKMY9y6sagh9pR0L8G.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8Xp29QHW75YcZO3bZEQSJuay06h.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":642}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"uk","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Не хвилюйся, двері відчиняться / Don't Worry, The Doors Will Open","key":"GQm1qx8Q5GU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-09-14T08:46:46.000Z","id":"6516e2f007216600ff351851"}]}}}
