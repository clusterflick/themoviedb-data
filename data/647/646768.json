When the old woman dies unexpectedly, the children are suddenly completely on their own. Leah is overwhelmed with the new responsibility. For the first time she also noticed adolescent changes on her body. Her whole life seems in transition. But Leah wants to hold on to her little world at any cost. Instead of getting help, the grandmother is lying in the stairwell. Theo adorns her with childlike zeal. The house itself becomes a garden of paradise in the middle of which, however, a corpse decomposes slowly. A gathering thunderstorm and a group of overstretched campers suddenly become a threat to the morbid paradise of the children.","popularity":0.0743,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Children of Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2454083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lea Drinda","original_name":"Lea Drinda","popularity":0.2077,"profile_path":"/1HYkiGcfdo9Gc5klqbRHpn1jJ4P.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Leah","credit_id":"5dc7e2326c0e4f00153a0530","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2082592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moritz Licht","original_name":"Moritz Licht","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Theo","credit_id":"5dc7e27f7d2bc1579833a86b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1187350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doris Buchrucker","original_name":"Doris Buchrucker","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Grandmother","credit_id":"5dc7e2906c0e4f00183a194a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16826,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Romeo Reimann","original_name":"Nick Romeo Reimann","popularity":0.3316,"profile_path":"/neOKLrDQouiMqlhqYZjxE6LJk8X.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Finn","credit_id":"628d560f6c849271887d3f98","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3562745,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcel Herrnsdorf","original_name":"Marcel Herrnsdorf","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Lasse","credit_id":"628d562bdf86a800505eed27","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3280350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosa Falkenhagen","original_name":"Rosa Falkenhagen","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Romy","credit_id":"628d56746f31af0066f1a537","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1841133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Roller","original_name":"Anna Roller","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/bUwpPfDVAEc0vSMbl6uac8qSFpX.jpg","credit_id":"637a8c3cc14fee00ad156b48","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1841133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Roller","original_name":"Anna Roller","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/bUwpPfDVAEc0vSMbl6uac8qSFpX.jpg","credit_id":"5dc7e2bcfe077a0012510c5f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1841136,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Felix Pflieger","original_name":"Felix Pflieger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc7e2dbfe077a0016514306","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: MUBI (Karlovy Vary)","release_date":"2019-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
