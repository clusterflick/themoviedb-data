He rarely meets his father, who has Alzheimer's disease, and it's awkward for him to meet his brother, Dong-seok, and his family. Nam-il, a colleague, uses his position to commit corruption and the youngest, Eun-seong, is too compassionate. One day, Dong-jin meets an ethnic Korean call girl named Yeon-hwa and starts to like her. She gets a call from a broker that he's withholding her niece, Soon-bok, who escaped from the North. Looking at Yeon-hwa and Soon-bok's sadness and innocent lives, Dong-jin's life begins to change. His father dies and Yeon-hwa kills herself. Dong-jin tries his best to save Soon-bok. He risks everything for her, but his efforts become worthless when Nam-il frames him for his irregularities and Eun-seong betrays him to protect their own family. Dong-jin loses everything and is left only with his search for Soon-bok.","popularity":0.1871,"poster_path":"/ccFBPnmzkD6bWUwByJ55Cw4G0L4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15974,"logo_path":"/whf327LIlsbElBmCXIgnL0aueko.png","name":"MCMC","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2019-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Threshold of Death","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1044800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeong Man-sik","original_name":"정만식","popularity":0.5771,"profile_path":"/baINoANAu5iPrYz7cXTqPgeRTPe.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dong-jin","credit_id":"5ddad6e1a8067300140fc382","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2159482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Ji-hoon","original_name":"이지훈","popularity":0.2754,"profile_path":"/nGEQUdliUgn5RuVivan3tmfIQAf.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Nam-il","credit_id":"5ddad7220cd44600192a82f1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1680744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kang Eun-jin","original_name":"Kang Eun-jin","popularity":0.1247,"profile_path":"/lrKO3I6rbUTX4du7L99s3kTPecM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Yeon-hwa","credit_id":"5dc69904a14e1000135c83fb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2453131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jang Myung-jin","original_name":"Jang Myung-jin","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Police 2","credit_id":"5dc699107d2bc10017435fc4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3688193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kwon Hyuk","original_name":"Kwon Hyuk","popularity":0.1169,"profile_path":"/egQfvudbnQGWGwcsYoLV45d5bIl.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6314d5d3ba131b007c557300","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3557016,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Eun-sang","original_name":"Lee Eun-sang","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628775801f3e60009b75472c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3557016,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Eun-sang","original_name":"Lee Eun-sang","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628dc2c39defda0051ac6d1e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3160887,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Yoo Seok-moon","original_name":"Yoo Seok-moon","popularity":0.0573,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f248a31d78f2002f70bddd","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4037774,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Seo Yeon","original_name":"Seo Yeon","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644f2bf0c0a30802dd700f3d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kST7FATefPQYI8z9PRoBPSOhYZn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fxDyZCrqFZSSeMCZ0kPRcbfzEv4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ccFBPnmzkD6bWUwByJ55Cw4G0L4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":631}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"2019-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Threshold of Death (2019) Korean Movie Trailer","key":"vDOF-C_EzsE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-11-09T16:06:37.000Z","id":"5dc6e45a470ead001893ac2e"}]}}}
