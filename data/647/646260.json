The set is like a high iron walled hanger and the stage is continually occupied with people who look like fugitives from Mad Max and who interact with Mefistofele. The orchestra and choir are wonderful. Rene Pape gives a nuanced interpretation with a certain amount of sardonic humour under the evil. His singing and acting are first rate, as is that of Kristine Opolais and Joseph Calleja.","popularity":0.2033,"poster_path":"/7jnPahfMEeRlXjXseF6fLf513eC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42411,"logo_path":"/9osTYTduHkM6Il6XixUTfdNcaoP.png","name":"C Major Entertainment","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mefistofele","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"René Pape","original_name":"René Pape","popularity":0.1141,"profile_path":"/1VsWqoYANXZNivalpSZfNNqny2H.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mefistofele","credit_id":"5dc58133ab1bc70018ff9c13","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":485620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Calleja","original_name":"Joseph Calleja","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/3ElrV7iefsTnkH642MgPk7pp367.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Faust","credit_id":"5dc58155470ead00189086d4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1569376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristine Opolais","original_name":"Kristine Opolais","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/zGHyp1MR6JBocvZin7RK0GESfiR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Margherita","credit_id":"5dc581889c24fc0013bec37b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2452426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karine Babajanyan","original_name":"Karine Babajanyan","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/77d3MhSa8Eyf2IuHdwczwCXksiX.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Elena","credit_id":"5dc581cc6f8d950017c2a8c4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1576362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heike Grötzinger","original_name":"Heike Grötzinger","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/5GPjuLXQvw4aw89Xvt7sfiXmucX.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Marta","credit_id":"5dc581e5ab1bc70018ff9e04","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2452428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Borghini","original_name":"Andrea Borghini","popularity":0.1514,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Wagner","credit_id":"5dc582026f8d950017c2a90b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2168815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachael Wilson","original_name":"Rachael Wilson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Pantalis","credit_id":"5dc5821a99259c00187e3bc4","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2449845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joshua Owen Mills","original_name":"Joshua Owen Mills","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/pAAyFEJyddrqxchuNeWmhwZhiD0.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Nereo","credit_id":"5dc582319c24fc0015bec36c","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2452429,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Omer Meir Wellber","original_name":"Omer Meir Wellber","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5dc5828599259c00187e3c9e","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66797,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Johann Wolfgang von Goethe","original_name":"Johann Wolfgang von Goethe","popularity":0.0946,"profile_path":"/sZcfT3pqAqibYjnYOjD841vXjEk.jpg","credit_id":"5dc583ba9c24fc0013bec97f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093378,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arrigo Boito","original_name":"Arrigo Boito","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc583ac99259c00187e3fac","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2452430,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roland Schwab","original_name":"Roland Schwab","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc5839d7d2bc10013409273","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9GAIcMgJzpdlmgakFnxu9fwF0qg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7jnPahfMEeRlXjXseF6fLf513eC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
