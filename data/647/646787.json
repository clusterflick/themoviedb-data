Grainy blue tinted images of a swaying branch of silver balls rhythmically knocking each other, mesmerise and evoke a sense of our own physical desire and fear. A hypnotic voice-over of a woman's account of a violent moment with her lover conveys a sense of the continual but unattainable desire to reconcile fantasy with external reality.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/5rNqhTdu1zMB9RVLsAv5Lz7slXw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One and the Other Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1302686,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Turner","original_name":"Sarah Turner","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc7ea697d2bc1001346739e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.692,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5rNqhTdu1zMB9RVLsAv5Lz7slXw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1992}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
