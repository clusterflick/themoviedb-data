It follows the story of 'Pep' who becomes a local hero after taking the law into his own hands to prevent a crime. Relishing in his new found glory, Pep joins the neighbourhood watch to further his agenda and fulfil his dream of creating a utopia; a town free of crime and antisocial behaviour. Before long, the extremity of Pep's measures and his aggressive and violent approach to achieving his goals becomes unacceptable to the local community and he is shunned. Desperate to regain his hero status, the rumour of a paedophile gives Pep one last chance to save the day; a manhunt ensues.","popularity":0.2956,"poster_path":"/AmVwh8Vjj73bQlJiPvqZjrOOUDL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88615,"logo_path":"/mTNLbswxsrZw56OBiXMmsp28EV1.png","name":"Evolutionary Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Big trouble in little England","title":"Small Town Hero","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2453570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Cassidy","original_name":"Simon Cassidy","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Pep","credit_id":"5dc704e69c24fc0018c23e43","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2453571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Millie Reeves","original_name":"Millie Reeves","popularity":0.2238,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Becky","credit_id":"5dc704f69c24fc0018c23e63","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1243423,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moir Leslie","original_name":"Moir Leslie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sal","credit_id":"5dc705069c24fc0015c293e6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1160330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Vivash","original_name":"Johnny Vivash","popularity":0.0905,"profile_path":"/vVpZRUvnYht0GE9rpyHuVJnAOCQ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Patrick","credit_id":"5dc70518a14e1000135d9e60","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4112791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Evans","original_name":"Joe Evans","popularity":0.1161,"profile_path":"/h2bShFDGUOFTcVcvJhCcnOwN647.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Adrian","credit_id":"650e94c9a9117f00c4a7ec6c","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1404637,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ernesto Herrmann","original_name":"Ernesto Herrmann","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6424546a37b3a9011364f237","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2453572,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darren Bolton","original_name":"Darren Bolton","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc7056799259c001581d70f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2453572,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darren Bolton","original_name":"Darren Bolton","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc7057a7d2bc10011438c79","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2453573,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Emily Bignell","original_name":"Emily Bignell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc70592470ead00139451f5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2453574,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mark Adair","original_name":"Mark Adair","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc705c0a14e1000175db51c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2453575,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Laura Cordery","original_name":"Laura Cordery","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc705f99c24fc0013c27dc1","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3209560","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bmOx1nZ4gH27QRWqIg1oHoa5Jef.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.719,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/AmVwh8Vjj73bQlJiPvqZjrOOUDL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":719},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qvV7w1uCpjYgNrT8Isf4b9jhlVG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667},{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":945,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oHv05Wvmxekw08DYyBRP2pTgJ9F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":163053,"name":"found footage"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Small Town Hero - UK Release Trailer","key":"0_bQsIY207s","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2019-04-13T17:19:50.000Z","id":"5dc707ac470ead0013945c38"}]}}}
