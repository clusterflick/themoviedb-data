The keynote is that the artist has expanded his realm from the two-dimentional picture frame, climaxed by the artists of the 40s and early 50s, merged color with sculpture, and sought out modern media to express himself. This has produced the characteristic wide spectrum of interest, ideas, and products in contemporary art.","popularity":0.2047,"poster_path":"/8NCYMcn5EYpzgZI1l0yRmDtmVfd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":41371,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bailey Films,
