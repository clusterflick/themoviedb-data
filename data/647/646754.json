But for a spurned Spartan princess, there are only two options left: forgiveness and murder.  The most ambitious and innovative of all Rossiniâ€™s operas, Ermione was a calamitous failure on its opening night at the Teatro di San Carlo 200 years ago. It now returns to the Neapolitan theatre in a new production by Italian director Jacopo Spirei starring American soprano Angela Meade in the title role.","popularity":0.0633,"poster_path":"/3Iq6SdzmxW5Aw9gDMWVOQkvtQFy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ermione - Rossini","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1576931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Meade","original_name":"Angela Meade","popularity":0.0745,"profile_path":"/pLMj6XPlTfPehXCwSvojPVxeVBV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5dc7de067d2bc15798339c45","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2256081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teresa Iervolino","original_name":"Teresa Iervolino","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/vaKiejuM6dHwEtn2fEePSj7R2Sy.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5dc7de0d6c0e4f00183a0fb9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2454075,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Irvin","original_name":"John Irvin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5dc7de1899259c665e791ed7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1548868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonino Siragusa","original_name":"Antonino Siragusa","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5dc7de1efe077a0016513919","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2225987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Filippo Adami","original_name":"Filippo Adami","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5dc7de26ab1bc70015049996","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guido Loconsolo","original_name":"Guido Loconsolo","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/2vOpnx2oxkzfpSGRmIFCYTwA1dW.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5dc7de2c99259c001583aa76","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2220631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaia Petrone","original_name":"Gaia Petrone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5dc7de337d2bc15a3733c8db","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2454076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chiara Tirotta","original_name":"Chiara Tirotta","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5dc7de3a6c0e4f00183a104a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1574930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cristiano Olivieri","original_name":"Cristiano Olivieri","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5dc7de4199259c001583ab4c","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2446110,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alessandro De Marchi","original_name":"Alessandro De Marchi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc7de4d6c0e4f001539fb4d","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2454077,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacopo Spirei","original_name":"Jacopo Spirei","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc7de58470ead001596390a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.625,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3Iq6SdzmxW5Aw9gDMWVOQkvtQFy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
