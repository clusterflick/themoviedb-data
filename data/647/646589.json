Initially Buchser was busy portraying politicians and generals in the spirit of his clients. More and more, however, he became interested in the Indians expelled to the reservations and in the living conditions of the slaves who had just been freed.  Years earlier, fascinated by Moorish culture, Frank Buchser rides disguised as a Turkish sheikh to the Moroccan town of Fez, which is forbidden to Christians under death penalty. The Swiss filmmaker Bruno Moll tells the two adventurous journeys of the rebellious and controversial artist.","popularity":0.1106,"poster_path":"/j0eNikzgSzRJI8Sc3vIRb8V5dn1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125091,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bruno Moll Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2019-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Song of Mary Blane","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1559368,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruno Moll","original_name":"Bruno Moll","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc719ae6c0e4f001338871a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1559368,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruno Moll","original_name":"Bruno Moll","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc71a03a14e1000105d8bf3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2203288,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anja Bombelli","original_name":"Anja Bombelli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc71a21a14e1000105d8c0d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1555106,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Edwin Horak","original_name":"Edwin Horak","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc71a3f470ead0015949461","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":2838,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j0eNikzgSzRJI8Sc3vIRb8V5dn1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
