It's hard to believe, but his wards are members of the national football team of the Republic of Belarus among the blind. Each of them appeared on the field for various reasons, but today they face a common task - to maintain their champion status in the national competition. Kirillov himself grew up in a disabled family and knows well how to communicate with his wards. He is not only a mentor, but also a friend of each of the athletes. An important element of the film is work with sound, it completely restored the sound environment that is natural for players, in which they focus on the noise made by the ball and the clear instructions of the coach.","popularity":0.3065,"poster_path":"/tavhItWfGj0gZW19mJm4o5iH6EP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111158,"logo_path":"/9m4vqLnfjoPeyJteUmi2LZQDJ1c.png","name":"Current Time TV","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BY","name":"Belarus"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Coach","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Trener","type":"Transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2592601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oleg Kirillov","original_name":"Oleg Kirillov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ed4b4d7528b2e001f69025c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2452345,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olga Abramchik","original_name":"Olga Abramchik","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc565eb6f8d950013c2c9ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2452345,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olga Abramchik","original_name":"Olga Abramchik","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc565fe99259c00187e137b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2443923,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Edgar Grischuk","original_name":"Edgar Grischuk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc56610ab1bc70015ff003f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2452346,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pavel Butorin","original_name":"Pavel Butorin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc566496f8d950010c2d303","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2333429,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aliaksander Yasinski","original_name":"Aliaksander Yasinski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc566756f8d950017c27f7b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11863798","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":1685,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4FsUwOLofSnavWMW75TBsIZ27md.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3000},{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":1685,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mMkwFxgHwISmFWE8BFNiiJXwXjU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"be","file_path":"/tavhItWfGj0gZW19mJm4o5iH6EP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1741,"name":"blindness and impaired vision"},{"id":13042,"name":"football (soccer)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Art Doc Fest","release_date":"2019-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Coach (English subtitles), Director Olga Abramchik, 2019","key":"339517475","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-05-31T09:47:08.000Z","id":"5ed4b8d51b157d002053508f"}]}}}
