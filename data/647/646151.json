It’s also a refugee city, a cluster of neighborhoods, a militarized zone, a border town. And Asian American. This collection of four short documentaries, commissioned on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the San Diego Asian Film Festival, maps many such San Diego’s – across ethnicity, geography and history. At the same time, they hold on to some notion of paradise, however illusory: a haven from war, the dreams of an immigrant, precious teenage reminiscences, solace in the afterlife, and spaces for creative expression.","popularity":0.0538,"poster_path":"/3swzhkkVYaE4Z6QULhTOyUPJ6J8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125020,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pacific Arts Movement","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""},{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Paradise We Are Looking For","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2452110,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Mangat","original_name":"Joseph Mangat","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/xRgkHLBLSNlI4te7NeaKUrthF5o.jpg","credit_id":"5dc51659ab1bc70015fe5192","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1832034,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Norbert Shieh","original_name":"Norbert Shieh","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc51667ab1bc70015fe51b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1679767,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Quyên Nguyen-Le","original_name":"Quyên Nguyen-Le","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc516767d2bc100173ff569","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1596359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"R.J.
