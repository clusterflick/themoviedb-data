Sam is the more extroverted type, a woman of action; Alma is rather withdrawn and contemplative. Full of passion, they bridge the differences in their daily life. When it comes to love, they both agree: they long for the ultimate commitment. Their journey proves not to be easy, as their same-sex union is not approved by everyone. However, hope is awaiting them at the end of the path.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/4fyas4kjGeBcX2FFYMaQtcWEWX4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Left to Their Senses","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2453950,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jules Fischer","original_name":"Jules Fischer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc7a0317d2bc15a373315d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3842364","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4fyas4kjGeBcX2FFYMaQtcWEWX4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":528}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
