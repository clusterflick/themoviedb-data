Päevade sõnad","overview":"People wander around looking for their lives that will always remain unattainable.\r This film is about Marju Lepajõe, who was a classical philologist, a religious historian and a lecturer at the Faculty of Theology at the University of Tartu. With a witty charm, Marju reflects on the modern world, where the need and the ability to deal with a subject matter in depth have become insignificant. Even universities, temples of erudition and culture, are losing their intellectual aspect. Where can a scholar find their place in these unfavourable circumstances? The viewers get a chance to follow Marju on her path towards refined wording and personal truth. This is an encounter that broadens the mind, offers comfort and inspires","popularity":0.0824,"poster_path":"/zexnZvjeqtEX7yXgo4NJQbzWs7g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6153,"logo_path":null,"name":"F-Seitse","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2019-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Verba Dierum: A Year with Marju Lepajõe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2451772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marju Lepajõe","original_name":"Marju Lepajõe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5dc490256f8d950013c1043d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":137611,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kaie-Ene Rääk","original_name":"Kaie-Ene Rääk","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/qvbBA8rx7NMMMO2PwYGaklR6sO.jpg","credit_id":"625337f7b6c26457afd21b8c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1152385,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mart Kessel-Otsa","original_name":"Mart Kessel-Otsa","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/c6MTdLFTfp8KEQrlipVVNIIqVrF.jpg","credit_id":"6253381077b1fb00a10cd134","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116257,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Erik Põllumaa","original_name":"Erik Põllumaa","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/fj6BHAaRs2s2eVL5sAuYPSygXUV.jpg","credit_id":"5dc49066ab1bc70015fd63f3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":137611,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kaie-Ene Rääk","original_name":"Kaie-Ene Rääk","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/qvbBA8rx7NMMMO2PwYGaklR6sO.jpg","credit_id":"5dc4904f470ead00138ea879","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1682619,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vallo Toomla","original_name":"Vallo Toomla","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":"/p4dNpTYv2A4MbZfTwdW9LZxvqiZ.jpg","credit_id":"5dc4903f8d22fc00123f00ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11448452","wikidata_id":"Q97225057","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":2731,"iso_639_1":"et","file_path":"/zexnZvjeqtEX7yXgo4NJQbzWs7g.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1902},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2829,"iso_639_1":"et","file_path":"/qGixhsYIvtdQujzYz7Z54TSZWB2.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"et","note":"Tartu Elektriteater","release_date":"2019-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
