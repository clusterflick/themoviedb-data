He was notorious for his article “We Have No Soviet Filmmaking,” in which he criticized all the achievements of the Soviet avant-garde. In spite of his beliefs and his scandalous struggle with “bourgeois” and “formalist” filmmaking, Petrov-Bytov directed an aesthetically refined work, shot entirely on set with masterful chiaroscuro lighting: a perfect example of “Soviet expressionism.” Based on a Maxim Gorky story, the plot of Cain and Artem provides a wake-up call to the Russian people to overcome alcoholism and religious factionalism, as it spotlights the (many) drunken denizens of a typical village and their disregard for the Jewish shoemaker Cain.","popularity":0.1468,"poster_path":"/mUiEYD08Ogf1wOdRyJ7b2JtP1jC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":410,"logo_path":"/eZlhJ4iCRM90hLB4RCC6RJEC9zr.png","name":"Sovkino","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1930-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cain and Artem","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Kain i Artem","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1540569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emil Gal","original_name":"Emil Gal","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/ngqGd7TSRYKDYWC150jrnaGSmoE.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Cain","credit_id":"5dc77f806c0e4f0018391fac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":549136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikolai Simonov","original_name":"Николай Симонов","popularity":0.2914,"profile_path":"/bBlyAbmOJtZXit48SSnXsTEJ17.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Artem","credit_id":"5dc77f8c99259c001382a6bf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":999622,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yelena Yegorova","original_name":"Yelena Yegorova","popularity":0.0664,"profile_path":"/8sZnzy0PkJHwxRzAfjFFbuaS3U4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Woman in the Market Place","credit_id":"5dc77f9f6905fb0019ff4506","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2453906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgiy Uvarov","original_name":"Georgiy Uvarov","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Husband of Woman in the Market Place","credit_id":"5dc77fb27d2bc1001745918a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1363567,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pavel Petrov-Bytov","original_name":"Pavel Petrov-Bytov","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc77edcab1bc7001503a601","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2453908,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nikolai Ushakov","original_name":"Nikolai Ushakov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672786f6720f0476f60d8b17","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1363567,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pavel Petrov-Bytov","original_name":"Pavel Petrov-Bytov","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672788c6720f0476f60d8be9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":213447,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maxim Gorky","original_name":"Максим Горький","popularity":0.2431,"profile_path":"/sA2KqxfqBpCwHxlC1LrEduZwqq1.jpg","credit_id":"672788f0de69a78ba9642f47","department":"Writing","job":"Short Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1522406,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Isaak Makhlis","original_name":"Исаак Махлис","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67278966008c8137852dda37","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0130054","wikidata_id":"Q18425937","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mUiEYD08Ogf1wOdRyJ7b2JtP1jC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1930-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
