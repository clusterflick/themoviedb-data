The first part of the film consists of footage shot by using rotating objects that were located between the camera and the collage. The image is thus split, causing a hypnotic effect. The second part of the film consists of a single shot of collages that keep changing. The images are interrupted by shots of flat colour surfaces.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"After the Colours","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2172060,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mattijn Seip","original_name":"Mattijn Seip","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc566567d2bc100134063f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
