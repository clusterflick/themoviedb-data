In fact, he wrote only a single opera in his short career he died at the age of 36 , but with it, he left us a gem of rare beauty and extreme concision. The work's genius is also due in part to the quality of the libretto, skilfully put together by Nahum Tate.Cécile Roussat and Julien Lubek, stage directors coming from the arts of the circus and the mime Marceau, had already collaborated with Le Poème Harmonique on the Carnaval Baroque. Here, they combine mime, dance and acrobatics with the music in a moving, magical production.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/jkrSUsuGt9DURBY1FmvFgNREHPQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Purcell:  Dido & Aeneas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2770321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivica Genaux","original_name":"Vivica Genaux","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Dido","credit_id":"672797b45af29e88553b03d0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1563362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henk Neven","original_name":"Henk Neven","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Aeneas","credit_id":"672797d6c0bc0749d0d8a05f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3362303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Quintans","original_name":"Ana Quintans","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/psD11lbxzgi5EQrgt9orr06AGJT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Belinda","credit_id":"672797f3720f0476f60d8ed3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2265593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Mauillon","original_name":"Marc Mauillon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/b9QkzprNAy1iMTgaCS0flDHzoYH.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sorcerer","credit_id":"67279818720f0476f60d8ef0","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1572066,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Henry Purcell","original_name":"Henry Purcell","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67279835e64e360884a8dd16","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4301319,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vincent Dumestre","original_name":"Vincent Dumestre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672798409dcc2dd5347451e1","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3210896,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Le Poème Harmonique","original_name":"Le Poème Harmonique","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672798555af29e88553b040d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1068732,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Cécile Roussat","original_name":"Cécile Roussat","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672798d8e64e360884a8dd7a","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1068731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julien Lubek","original_name":"Julien Lubek","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672798e25af29e88553b045b","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l0m9IiOXVYyBj4La1pPOSpIAmyk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jkrSUsuGt9DURBY1FmvFgNREHPQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2015-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
