The same is presented to us by way of Neha, a girl from the city, or as the locals call it, from “down”, who has ended up living at the house of a villager, due to an unexpected alignment of the different variables of her trip. She is a documentary filmmaker who spends her time interacting and interviewing those around her. Consequently, our introduction to this close-knit community is executed through the many interactions she has with it.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4vHFUxj6ez7wzmufLzX6UYQwyiZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"kemra","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3452445,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sumit Raina","original_name":"Sumit Raina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672848d25af29e88553b112e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3452444,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sameeksha Zia","original_name":"Sameeksha Zia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672848ee761979f005e2c7a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4vHFUxj6ez7wzmufLzX6UYQwyiZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":773}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"The Himalayan Film Festival 2023 I 2nd Edition","release_date":"2023-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
