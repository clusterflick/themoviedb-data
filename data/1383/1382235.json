With the announcement, controversy arrives, quickly derailing any sense of objectivity in the debate. While some celebrate the economic upswing or even hope to combat climate change, others are alarmed by Tesla’s lax adherence to building regulations in the middle of a drinking water protection zone. Excitement and outrage both grow as Tesla also plans to expand the factory site. As local resistance feels betrayed by decision-makers, the AfD senses an opportunity.  An entertaining yet unsettling case study of our culture of political debate and the overwhelming nature of the climate crisis in the microcosm of Grünheide.","popularity":0.0398,"poster_path":"/6gkGvp3qUZCsHFxafIxWXKTgJ5K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":665,"logo_path":"/bUomMJoEX2W7XpgvNeWswCFKzrW.png","name":"Hochschule für Fernsehen und Film München","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2024-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"House of Cars","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4291012,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sebastian Eggerbauer","original_name":"Sebastian Eggerbauer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6727c74c398c9043f80d306c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5039153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Groß","original_name":"Michael Groß","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6727c76d629055e1383b8725","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/6gkGvp3qUZCsHFxafIxWXKTgJ5K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"58.
