The film engages with the sensory aspect of practices associated with the night in Cuba, from the post-revolutionary guard sessions of neighborhood night watching, to nocturnal activities related to technology, media infrastructure, and nighttime economy. When the night falls in Guantánamo and invades the streets, other forms of life emerge. GUARDIANS OF THE NIGHT sheds light on the people, activities, sites and ideas that occur on an everyday basis at night time in Eastern Cuba.","popularity":0.0388,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"When the sun goes down the night invades the streets of Guantánamo, Cuba.","title":"Guardians of the Night","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","title":"Guardianes de la Noche","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3192631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandrine Boudreault-Fournier","original_name":"Alexandrine Boudreault-Fournier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67291cc1a5077bb1d35550b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5040808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eleonora Diamanti","original_name":"Eleonora Diamanti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67291cd3c090109580fa1535","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8593808","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
