Over the years, it has become home to many cultural workers and creatives. Galleries, studios, rehearsal rooms, music clubs, an arthouse cinema, and the Offene Kanal (Public Access TV) are all located here. Between abandoned train tracks and old industrial buildings, important venues of the city’s cultural life emerged. However, by the end of 2023, many of these alternative and subversive institutions were forced to close. Deutsche Bahn increased rents and sent out eviction notices, citing plans to build a new operations center. To make a statement against this development, a group from Piraten Kanal Kassel organized a performative takeover of the station on New Year’s Eve. The film shows live performances that took place in the station hall, at Franz Ulrich, and in Stellwerk, combining them with small portraits and clips about the now vanished creative spaces.","popularity":0.0604,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Piraten Kanal Kassel: Bahnsinn","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5041630,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Piraten Kanal Kassel","original_name":"Piraten Kanal Kassel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672979d2cc1d12827d0c472d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1426265,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Christoph Neugebauer","original_name":"Christoph Neugebauer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672979e2eb0fdd9cd84b1108","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5041632,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alisa Siebert","original_name":"Alisa Siebert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672979f0eb0fdd9cd84b1121","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4847016,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tobi Sauer","original_name":"Tobi Sauer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67297a03cc1d12827d0c4742","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"41.
