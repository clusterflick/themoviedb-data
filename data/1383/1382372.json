They've never shaken hands, never shared a glance, they've never even spoken, yet their stories will intersect under extraordinary circumstances when they find themselves in the crosshairs of a righteous hit man with a morality complex. Our heroes will have to embark on parallel journeys through a maze of greed, mystery, and suspense as they fight to achieve their greatest inner strength, their ultimate success, the one thing that makes them singular in the vast tapestry that is our world. And if they play their cards right, they may just live to fight another day.","popularity":0.6523,"poster_path":"/3eezs3coQPKienQGLn3nM20yTqL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":243750,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stuffed Duffel Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"The Line","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Summer Phoenix","original_name":"Summer Phoenix","popularity":0.4239,"profile_path":"/ncSXqGoq031Qj7DVREmtbWOjPqY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"James","credit_id":"67282972554083a56a0d795c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bradley Gregg","original_name":"Bradley Gregg","popularity":0.5277,"profile_path":"/wdutERs05CdWND79gtzXA8WVYrD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hatchet","credit_id":"67282983554083a56a0d7966","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1223877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent M.
