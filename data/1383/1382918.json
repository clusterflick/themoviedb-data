In the show, listeners can call in and share their own experiences, or those of someone they know, with the supernatural.  Usually, it’s about some cousin from Gällivare who has seen a shadow in the corner of his eye or heard a mysterious noise once. But this Wednesday, everything is different.  Frightened listeners calling in have all experienced terrifying phenomena throughout the evening. There have been sightings in the city of a revenant, apparently heading straight for the radio studio.","popularity":0.4286,"poster_path":"/wv4mI258uoEUMqbtyBLxhupATss.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":211641,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bortbyting
