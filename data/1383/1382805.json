Verdi takes us to 15th century northern Spain to witness the tragic destiny of those under the control of the gypsy Azucena, who seeks to avenge the death of his mother. The first percussion notes are solemn, setting the tone for Verdi’s masterpiece, whose main themes include abandonment, passion, power, love for one’s parents and vengeance. The music is sometimes tender and sensuous, with exceptional energy and force, revealing daring and mastery in its musical and vocal language.  This production marked the debut of Russian stage director Dmitri Tcherniakov at La Monnaie and the first Verdi interpretation by Marc Minkowski.","popularity":0.419,"poster_path":"/2WqR7EdVAfUyq5UMmSKjKc86OaB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":143,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Verdi: Il Trovatore","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1654503,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Misha Didyk","original_name":"Misha Didyk","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Manrico","credit_id":"67294b75554578c90de31c4a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":520067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marina Poplavskaya","original_name":"Marina Poplavskaya","popularity":0.0899,"profile_path":"/yPjZL0TmNLyiZjT3jWDFp6zrFyE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Leonora","credit_id":"67294b862e1b7978dbb3b147","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1564067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvie Brunet-Grupposo","original_name":"Sylvie Brunet-Grupposo","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/mKFlpfZeaEcNN8PVqTyVdS0Dtfy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Azucena","credit_id":"67294b9b0eb51c288758a4ce","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1268932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Hendricks","original_name":"Scott Hendricks","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Il Conte di Luna","credit_id":"67294bb647311eb8990b8476","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1123927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giovanni Furlanetto","original_name":"Giovanni Furlanetto","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/aa2HFmnkU12zeqS7gGZYDFzIipz.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ferrando","credit_id":"67294bc92282fe0e5b8badd5","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1569678,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dmitri Tcherniakov","original_name":"Dmitri Tcherniakov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/42uxTZ5tUwRmgFMT7jrWlKcKQOr.jpg","credit_id":"67294be22282fe0e5b8badeb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1569678,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dmitri Tcherniakov","original_name":"Dmitri Tcherniakov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/42uxTZ5tUwRmgFMT7jrWlKcKQOr.jpg","credit_id":"67294bf0554578c90de31c80","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338599,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marc Minkowski","original_name":"Marc Minkowski","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/o5Az1vnk5zowbyj37xLwNqYMmB7.jpg","credit_id":"67294c13554578c90de31c99","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1725991,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Gleb Filshtinsky","original_name":"Gleb Filshtinsky","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67294c29554578c90de31ca7","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2808750,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Elena Zaytseva","original_name":"Elena Zaytseva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67294c3e2282fe0e5b8badf2","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1382767,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Salvadore Cammarano","original_name":"Salvadore Cammarano","popularity":0.1203,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67294c522282fe0e5b8badfb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1680215,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Leone Emanuele Bardare","original_name":"Leone Emanuele Bardare","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67294c620eb51c288758a535","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2WqR7EdVAfUyq5UMmSKjKc86OaB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1334}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Il Trovatore | Marina Poplavskaya & Misha Didyk | La Monnaie 2012 (DVD/Blu-ray trailer)","key":"NcnwTZaPVK4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2014-09-23T12:28:45.000Z","id":"67294d3e0eb51c288758a575"}]}}}
