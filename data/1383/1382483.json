To this day he still holds the record as the most successful British rider in the premier division of the motocross world championships. Thorpe saw early success in his career with the UK Kawasaki Team before switching to the Honda factory racing team in 1983 where his success reached new heights claiming two consecutive world titles and a third in 1989 following a two year struggle with injury.  The on-track battles throughout his career were legendary with Thorpe taking on other titans of the era including Eric Geboers and André Malherbe. His enthralling story is told in depth by David, fellow team members, competitors, journalists and his close-knit circle of family & friends, whilst extensive archive race footage illustrates the awesome skill of this great British motocross legend.","popularity":0.2958,"poster_path":"/74LcUoEPGMoSNJfKaHQHnCJ4KI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"David Thorpe was a force to be reckoned with in 80s motocross.","title":"No Regrets The David Thorpe Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5040029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Thorpe","original_name":"David Thorpe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67288551555e3efc89c33f70","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5040030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Geboers","original_name":"Eric Geboers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67288565555e3efc89c33f7c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5040031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Malherbe","original_name":"André Malherbe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6728856f47311eb8990b657e","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":985,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/74LcUoEPGMoSNJfKaHQHnCJ4KI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10110,"name":"motocross"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
