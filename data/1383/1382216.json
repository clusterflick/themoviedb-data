Having persuaded the townspeople to invest their savings in the venture, the Count commits suicide, and the baron jilts the now-destitute Ann. Bereft Ann marries American promoter Slater, moving to the United States in hopes of earning enough to pay off her father's debts and the couple have a child. However, the baron follows Ann, raping her. Slater's jealous mother uses this opportunity to break up their marriage. Ordered from the house Ann has no option but to turn to the baron for sanctuary. Slater attempting a reconciliation for their child’s sake tracks her to the baron house where a fight occurs with both men being mortally wounded. Ann returns to her child; finds her mother-in-law repentant, and the three return to France to repay the debt.","popularity":0.134,"poster_path":"/7mkCCdq7G05VS7MfeBIepNOcvuZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":175581,"logo_path":null,"name":"Frank Powell Producing Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Debt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":83235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marjorie Rambeau","original_name":"Marjorie Rambeau","popularity":0.1645,"profile_path":"/cAUbCP4mm0L7msFyJnAiidxEUa8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Countess Ann","credit_id":"6727be68720f0476f60d90f8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Everton","original_name":"Paul Everton","popularity":0.1468,"profile_path":"/epDMiRMgBFKcywcPpdtIMnnlv4l.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"John Slater","credit_id":"6727be84008c8137852ddfae","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1308055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Sutherland","original_name":"Anne Sutherland","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/4RT9mAx4qR68WgGdgylQihsukbI.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Slater's Mother","credit_id":"6727be98a702fca22f0bae0e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agnes Ayres","original_name":"Agnes Ayres","popularity":0.1182,"profile_path":"/mQObJxwBA3epElaMwpDsXCvaQeH.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"The Girl","credit_id":"6727bea25af29e88553b056e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Elliott","original_name":"Robert Elliott","popularity":0.1393,"profile_path":"/qYExhk4bwDE4nTRa3d6n3PLNFdJ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6727bea9554578c90de2f0d5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2628314,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Warwick","original_name":"Henry Warwick","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Count","credit_id":"6727be71008c8137852ddfa1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3310580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"T.
