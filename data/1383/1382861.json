The film attempts to capture the disgust one can feel at being solipsistic and self-involved, but also hints at the good that can come out of such introspection. The film delves into my thoughts about my particular emotional situation, but also shows my attempts to deal with the world outside, if only on a visual level. LILTING TOWARDS CHAOS invites the viewer to examine what I have chosen to show him/her about my life at that time, and determine which musings are honest and useful, and which are circuitous and self-defeating.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lilting Towards Chaos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1345952,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Street","original_name":"Mark Street","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6729692a14d4a39972034070","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
