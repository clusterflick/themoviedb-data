Very little documentation of his life exists today, so this film uses the thorough contemplation of his canvases as the key to his story. Works by the landscape artists and still-life painters of his time help to illustrate the age in which he lived. The film furthermore exemplifies the elaborate conventions of portraiture at the time.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/ctSuxoJlFab96xqZiiPp7y9qNKn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frans Hals of Antwerp","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1469744,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jonne Severijn","original_name":"Jonne Severijn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6618094ff36a320163f94727","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5352782","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ctSuxoJlFab96xqZiiPp7y9qNKn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
