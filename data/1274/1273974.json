In this hopeless situation, the farmer's daughter Joan announces that God has commissioned her to liberate Orléans. The ‘Maid of Orléans’ may be victorious in battle but loses her heart in passion to a Burgundian knight, Lionel. The flames consume a woman torn between love and her divine mission.  Inspired by Schiller’s tragedy, Tchaikovsky wrote The Maid of Orleans about the famous French heroine between 1878 and 1879.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Maid of Orleans - TCHAIKOVSKY","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4621566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Kataeva","original_name":"Maria Kataeva","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"661a6150976a23016229152f","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
