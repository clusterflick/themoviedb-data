However, in reality, black is a colour of light. You cannot imagine there to be light without black being there, also\", Soulages explains - one of the most important French artists of the post-war period. Not only his paintings, but also his glass window works for the abbey in Conques and his self-designed house in Sete, seem like poems made up of light and space. Using 80 specially selected works, the brilliant artist talks about the individual segments of his creative period and provides an insight into the philosophy and aesthetics of his poetic work.","popularity":0.141,"poster_path":"/eSCljnjQcZcdUK3Ygkur5pjlmJL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pierre Soulages: Black Light","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2037307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Soulages","original_name":"Pierre Soulages","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/2Xw7GwKWqvJOTIxPvyR9hhU6YBB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6618f343e4c9eb017c2ad253","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4274035,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reiner E.
