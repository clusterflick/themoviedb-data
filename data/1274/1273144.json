In 1949, he caused a scandal with his sculpture La Famille. In 1956, after virulently condemning what he saw as the ossified nature of Quebec society, he exiled himself to France. Today, aged 76, he continues to live in Tourettes-sur-Loup, his refuge from the world, more alone and misunderstood than ever. This documentary uncovers the man behind the artist and attempts to shed light on the \"mystery\" of Robert Roussil.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roussil ou le curieux destin d'un anarchiste impénitent","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4647140,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Werner Volkmer","original_name":"Werner Volkmer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6617f15d90b87e017c3df2e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
