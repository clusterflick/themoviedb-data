The young, inexperienced woman falls head over heels in love with the urbane bon vivant. But he rejects her affection; his restless lifestyle is not suitable for a long-term relationship. Years later, the two meet again. The mature Tatyana has entered into a marriage of convenience with the much older Prince Gremin and has become a wealthy woman. Onegin is shocked to realise that Tatyana would have been the right one for him after all. How will she respond to his passionate confessionsâ€¦  German director Michael Thalheimer stages his fourth production for Deutsche Oper am Rhein, creating a world of unfulfilled longings in a society that has grown tired of itself.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/qfKoNOsUriQqycwYy9lhAcoV1Hm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eugene Onegin - DOR","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katarzyna Kuncio","original_name":"Katarzyna Kuncio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"661a73be4e4dff017ed1b3c4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4650685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ekaterina Sannikova","original_name":"Ekaterina Sannikova","popularity":0.1191,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"661a73c693db92017d0b8e26","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4650686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramona Zaharia","original_name":"Ramona Zaharia","popularity":0.0418,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"661a73ce7ecd28017c4b636b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2381393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bogdan Baciu","original_name":"Bogdan Baciu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"661a73d52cde9801870a201a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4650687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ovidiu Purcel","original_name":"Ovidiu Purcel","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"661a73dd982f74018646e618","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4650688,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vitali Alekseenok","original_name":"Vitali Alekseenok","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661a73e8976a23012f28bc10","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1486422,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Thalheimer","original_name":"Michael Thalheimer","popularity":0.1627,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661a73f3af6e94017ded38b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qfKoNOsUriQqycwYy9lhAcoV1Hm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
