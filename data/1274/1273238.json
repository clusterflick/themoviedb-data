Some of his more interesting finds speckle his home. His neighbors mostly disregard him. On one of his regular hunts, he chances upon an envelope. To his surprise, he finds old wedding photos and presumes the addressee, Angie, to be the bride. Determined to complete the delivery, Jasper follows a map to the address. When he finally arrives, his excitement is upended when Angie, now divorced, rebuffs him and the photos. He leaves her with an open invitation to his home, should she change her mind. The next morning, Jasper starts his routine-only to find Angie at his door. After a heart-to-heart on loss and new life, Jasper invites Angie to pick up trash with him. Together, they go.","popularity":1.2679,"poster_path":"/sbdR9Y6jUrXxee6fej5VHrQjamZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":225907,"logo_path":null,"name":"Third Rail Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"ONE WOMAN'S TRASH IS ANOTHER MAN'S TREASURE.","title":"Best Wishes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3353041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Force","original_name":"Edward Force","popularity":0.1469,"profile_path":"/sLMZVhHuRWI2BJvNYnJSVoQp42K.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jasper","credit_id":"661819c665c26c017d375bf2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3789342,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jessica Law-Davis","original_name":"Jessica Law-Davis","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/hdaVj1S6FakPxq1Z1JppLjzQREm.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Angie","credit_id":"661819df544c410163278094","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4647481,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Walls","original_name":"Jonathan Walls","popularity":0.0684,"profile_path":"/lUNPiMndPjgUyeUViOiBrnXz8ms.jpg","credit_id":"66181a04498ef9017cdff2e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4647483,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Selena Fack","original_name":"Selena Fack","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66181a11498ef9017cdff2f2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4647486,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Lauren Alice","original_name":"Lauren Alice","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66181a1f2b1b44017cf3e3f6","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4647490,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"M.T.
