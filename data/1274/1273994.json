It’s New Year Eve and we are in the company of Rosalinde, who is determined to teach her philandering husband Eisenstein a lesson, even while she is being pursued by her former beau, the operatic tenor Alfred. At the centre of the action is the extremely wealthy, eternally bored Prince Orlofsky, whose lavish masked ball brings everything to a most delicious boil. But what if the whole plot has been a cunning plan masterminded by someone just to get back at Eisenstein?  Die Fledermaus, Johann Strauss II’s comic operetta in three acts which premiered in 1874, has become a synonym of the operetta genre.","popularity":0.0507,"poster_path":"/mCFrUTxhMYgDSHlKvyutLpOeJ3T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Fledermaus - CNT","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4091522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Domagoj Dorotić","original_name":"Domagoj Dorotić","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"661a71998c31590132c0d931","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2180094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentina Fijačko Kobić","original_name":"Valentina Fijačko Kobić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"661a71a193db92017d0b8cdc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4091523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marija Kuhar Šoša","original_name":"Marija Kuhar Šoša","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"661a71a85ff34e017c597021","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2447925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ljubomir Puškarić","original_name":"Ljubomir Puškarić","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"661a71af69eb900149b782e0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4650676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roko Radovan","original_name":"Roko Radovan","popularity":0.0601,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"661a71b68c3159015fc0f24b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1985597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Krešimir Dolenčić","original_name":"Krešimir Dolenčić","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661a71cc514c4a017c673ec9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3237922,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Srba Dinić","original_name":"Srba Dinić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661a71d57ecd28017c4b61ea","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mCFrUTxhMYgDSHlKvyutLpOeJ3T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
