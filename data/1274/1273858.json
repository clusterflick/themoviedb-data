For some time now she has been supporting her family alone. Her desire is to graduate from college and get a job with better pay. While she carries out her daily life transporting passengers and getting paid for it. This way of earning a living is carried out mostly by men, so finding a woman doing this way of working is very surprising. Daya is one of the many women in the Dominican Republic who dedicate themselves to informal work as a result of unemployment.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/7jl31pXM3Oiglq7YQYy37Knqqn2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DO","name":"Dominican Republic"}],"release_date":"2015-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daya","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4650108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dayanari González","original_name":"Dayanari González","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6619cb0faf9590017c5f15c6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4650109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robelitza Pérez","original_name":"Robelitza Pérez","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6619cb2f4e4dff0164d11b4a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4650109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robelitza Pérez","original_name":"Robelitza Pérez","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6619cb52967cc7014c9eac93","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4650109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robelitza Pérez","original_name":"Robelitza Pérez","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6619cbf169eb90017cb763e9","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1686677,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Leo Pérez","original_name":"Leo Pérez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6619cf7cd363e5017c5e7958","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1686677,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Leo Pérez","original_name":"Leo Pérez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6619cf98daf57c017c3eeddc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1686677,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Leo Pérez","original_name":"Leo Pérez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6619d0478c31590193c0e6a0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9635634","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7jl31pXM3Oiglq7YQYy37Knqqn2.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1365}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"(Festival Mujer y Trabajo)","release_date":"2015-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
