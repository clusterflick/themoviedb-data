It depicts the atmosphere of unease, fear and uncertainty about the future as a village cobbler tries to stick to the straight and narrow path of honesty.  Composed by Feliksas Bajoras in 1982, Lamb of God is based on an eponymous novel by Rimantas Šavelis. 11 March 1990, the Republic of Lithuania was re-established as an independent state, the first Soviet Republic to leave Moscow and leading other states to do so. With a subject that treats the resistance of people in post-war Lithuania, the piece had to wait nearly four decades for its premiere.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/dKxcFjf9b9OU2W3IMQALsENvwBm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lamb of God - BAJORAS","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2790145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steponas Zonys","original_name":"Steponas Zonys","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"661a5071af959001635f83ec","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4650562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeronimas Krivickas","original_name":"Jeronimas Krivickas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"661a5079af6e94017ded27f1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4650563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kšištof Bondarenko","original_name":"Kšištof Bondarenko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"661a5081967cc7017f9f3af7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4650564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karolis Kašiuba","original_name":"Karolis Kašiuba","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"661a50894e4dff017ed1a0f3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4650565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kamilė Bontè","original_name":"Kamilė Bontè","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"661a5090982f740163467dd5","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4650566,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gintaras Rinkevičius","original_name":"Gintaras Rinkevičius","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661a509caf6e94017ded280a","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4637017,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Martynas Rimeikis","original_name":"Martynas Rimeikis","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661a50aa69eb90017cb82426","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dKxcFjf9b9OU2W3IMQALsENvwBm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
