After various tests she is finally rejected. Since this plan didn't work out she decides to join the kaiser-killers herself and so enters the recruiting station right next door. Here she is again rejected because of a flat head. Having failed twice she goes home feeling that she needs a little training and uses poor delicate little hubby as the goat. While Magnolia is still hard at work training with some dummies, hubby gets a note from Nicholas Nutmeg inviting him to a game of poker, but also inviting his little bank roll. Magnolia sees the note, becomes furious, and here follow some lively chases which end with hubby in jail and Magnolia trying hard to enlist in the army.","popularity":0.055,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":55436,"logo_path":null,"name":"Century Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hoot Toot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Howell","original_name":"Alice Howell","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/8SCO0ROD56aR90l6AjZTWXcPRHY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Magnolia Milkshake","credit_id":"66186af20f0da5017cdeae1b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1158159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James D.
