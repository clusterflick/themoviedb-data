Will all the intrigues be foiled, the misunderstandings straightened out for a peasant to be proclaimed emperor?  Il Giustino was originally composed for the 1724 Rome carnevale by Antonio Vivaldi to a libretto by Nicol√≤ Beregan. Vivaldi's score is full of picturesque detail.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/nEd64TJk1zGXGP1uSg3YpBFprhf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il Giustino","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2333268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raffaele Pe","original_name":"Raffaele Pe","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"661a4f4d982f74018646cc6f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4650560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofie Asplund","original_name":"Sofie Asplund","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"661a4f5569eb90017cb822e9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2148260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuriy Mynenko","original_name":"Yuriy Mynenko","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/yE0zZEOr0ktqkdQVLHbg9UBfmjr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"661a4f5c5ff34e016359050f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2720163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johanna Wallroth","original_name":"Johanna Wallroth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"661a4f634e4dff0132d11e06","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2235198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan Sancho","original_name":"Juan Sancho","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/9L7xGAdinrm34n5KzsQfgSJ2UAh.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"661a4f6bd363e5017c5f2555","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2235201,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Petrou","original_name":"George Petrou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661a4f79d363e5017c5f2568","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2235201,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Petrou","original_name":"George Petrou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661a4f7f982f740163467d1a","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":862,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nEd64TJk1zGXGP1uSg3YpBFprhf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":575}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-12-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
