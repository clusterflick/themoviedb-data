An art collector purchases a rare picture and the \"picture pirate,\" representing himself as another collector, calls on the first collector. As he is leaving the place Rube and Ben try to pick his pockets, and admonishing them as amateurs, he tells them to join in with him and try to steal the picture. They take the art collector's wife with them to the same caf√© wherein their wives are waitresses. Ben and Rube leave her there and hasten to her home to steal a copy of the picture, the owner having hidden the original. They also drink some poisoned whiskey left for them and fall into a fit. Later the \"picture pirate\" pays Rube and Ben for the picture, thinking it is the original.","popularity":0.0423,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1513,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vogue Motion Picture Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Picture Pirates","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rube Miller","original_name":"Rube Miller","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/j2PQc0AoaFWH5dz6BVxmtOE3lFx.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"1st Ne'er-Do-Well","credit_id":"661a29815ff34e017c593915","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Turpin","original_name":"Ben Turpin","popularity":0.1102,"profile_path":"/7j5ESXENAgKjVpAezqe29ivrv66.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"2nd Ne'er-Do-Well","credit_id":"661a299eaf959001635f700e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3421051,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Hamilton","original_name":"Lillian Hamilton","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/hPzmdmwX3vhN1dyezVGLruIkHq2.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"1st Ne'er-Do-Well's Wife","credit_id":"661a29b34e4dff017ed189e4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4650409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosie Rosee","original_name":"Rosie Rosee","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"2nd Ne'er-Do-Well's Wife","credit_id":"661a29cd982f740163466ab1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paddy McGuire","original_name":"Paddy McGuire","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"The Art Collector","credit_id":"661a29f1982f74018646ac67","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3442463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lawrence A.
