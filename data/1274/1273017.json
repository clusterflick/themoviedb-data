Together with industry participants, the film's narrator, musician Albert Tsukrenko, explores the financial, political and psychological reasons for the vulnerability of Ukrainian artists and reflects on how to break this vicious circle. Unfortunately, our own Ukrainian talents are becoming the ammunition in this weapon. Several generations of original Ukrainian musicians at different times in the 1970s and 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, and 2010s switched from Ukrainian to Russian in their work. Whether willingly or unwittingly, they became tools of Russian show business, which has always sought to blur the cultural border between Russia and Ukraine and worked to promote the imperial myth of \"one nation\".","popularity":0.4835,"poster_path":"/fS58dNRcA9dLvYqPRJ8297kgT5o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154771,"logo_path":null,"name":"Suspilne Media","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2024-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How Russia bought and destroyed Ukrainian show business","title":"Russification in pop style","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4857116,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Albert Tsukrenko","original_name":"Albert Tsukrenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a8ac9b037c3bc76b5c432d","department":"Writing","job":"Author"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4325980,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Victoria Kurochka","original_name":"Victoria Kurochka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a8acb0cf884841298cc8a9","department":"Writing","job":"Author"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4857116,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Albert Tsukrenko","original_name":"Albert Tsukrenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a8acc9d792dd03d4e0b29e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4857117,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oleksii Muliavin","original_name":"Oleksii Muliavin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a8ad0a7fd8288c9b5fb5fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fS58dNRcA9dLvYqPRJ8297kgT5o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2903,"name":"propaganda"},{"id":1740,"name":"pop culture"},{"id":283297,"name":"music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"uk","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"«Русифікація в стилі поп» | Документальний фільм на Суспільне Культура | ТРЕЙЛЕР","key":"qDpaPfBjlaw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-03-20T13:00:59.000Z","id":"6617a7294539d0017dfc9c34"}]}}}
