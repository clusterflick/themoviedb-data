The instrument’s heavenly sound pacifies the attackers, who lay down their weapons and kneel. But it won’t be long before the tones of this ‘singing devil’ resound again, this time from behind the burning walls of the monastery…  In the beginning of the 20th century, Austrian composer Franz Schreker was one of the only opera composers in the German-speaking world whose success could compete with Richard Strauss. But as of 1933, Schreker’s works were banned in Germany and began to disappear from the international repertoire.","popularity":0.1286,"poster_path":"/nUzsKOnCqjxPvjxZa1unLn3Rxyd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Singing Devil - Schreker","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4650659,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mirko Roschkowski","original_name":"Mirko Roschkowski","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"661a6c98976a23016229194a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4650660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne-Fleur Werner","original_name":"Anne-Fleur Werner","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"661a6ca12cde98014b09a469","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2403623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tobias Schabel","original_name":"Tobias Schabel","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/lxLR8Z7BXJvWvBkv8utURhut7jF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"661a6ca95ff34e0163591032","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3342980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dshamilja Kaiser","original_name":"Dshamilja Kaiser","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"661a6cb0514c4a016366dc41","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2130278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pavel Kudinov","original_name":"Pavel Kudinov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"661a6cb769eb90017cb83759","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3648707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dirk Kaftan","original_name":"Dirk Kaftan","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661a6cc58c3159015fc0f1dd","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3411566,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julia Burbach","original_name":"Julia Burbach","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661a6cd17ecd28017c4b5eb5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nUzsKOnCqjxPvjxZa1unLn3Rxyd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
