The woman is upset by her dreams and what she perceives as the untouchable nature of her mind, unlike the physical nature of her body. The man recounts the story of his youth – when he was not allowed to go out to play, his mind would go outside instead. An elliptical series of scenes unfold as though in the mind of the man – an encounter with an epileptic, a prostitute, and a demented therapist - all somehow address the mind/body schism. A school film written and completed in two weeks, incorporating preliminary image manipulation techniques via the use of contact printing and Mettler’s first use of sound montage in a musical sense.","popularity":0.0548,"poster_path":"/rblsYsf0c8G2bjRyTVNmRYcchZt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gregory","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1207913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Krantz","original_name":"Greg Krantz","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6619346aea84c7017d570809","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4649208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine MacFadyen","original_name":"Christine MacFadyen","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66193479109cd00165a39a62","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":985032,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Mettler","original_name":"Peter Mettler","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/cJeAJKcMdVOhAz8Pk5QZITIuw6P.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66193483dd731b014b0a4ca6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4649209,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kirstin Ruchards","original_name":"Kirstin Ruchards","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6619348bb9a0bd017c1196ff","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1608377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joey Hardin","original_name":"Joey Hardin","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"661934a2af3da60163188737","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":985032,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Mettler","original_name":"Peter Mettler","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/cJeAJKcMdVOhAz8Pk5QZITIuw6P.jpg","credit_id":"661934354da3d4016291c444","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rblsYsf0c8G2bjRyTVNmRYcchZt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
