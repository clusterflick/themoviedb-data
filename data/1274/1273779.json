Clokey showed the film to producer Sam Engel, who suggested that Clokey apply the technique to form children's stories. Although the next film Adventures of Gumby: A Sample (1955) was never televised, it is confirmed to be the first pilot episode of what would become The Gumby Show. Soon afterward, Clokey completed the second pilot for the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) through the financial assistance of Engel. Entitled Gumby on the Moon (which Moon Trip Part 1, the actual first episode), this marked the television debut of Gumby. The cartoon was presented on Howdy Doody to much success, and led to the development of the series The Gumby Show.","popularity":0.1076,"poster_path":"/9Yfe4rTr46M651Q6z19kkWuPaK6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adventures of Gumby: A Sample","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Art Clokey","original_name":"Art Clokey","popularity":0.2282,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6619866812197e014abbadc5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9Yfe4rTr46M651Q6z19kkWuPaK6.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10121,"name":"stop motion"},{"id":197065,"name":"claymation"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"DVD","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
