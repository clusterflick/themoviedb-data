As EastEnders’ biggest stars, including Pat Evans, Ian Beale, Janine Butcher and Phil Mitchell, provide their own memories of the sometimes happy couple, Tiffany has a mystery to solve: why is Carol Jackson determined to miss Bianca’s big day? Meanwhile, determined to enjoy a romantic Valentine’s Day, Ricky and Bianca stroll through the streets of the square, reminiscing about their own experiences and looking forward to their dream wedding, even putting on their dancing shoes for an amazing tango treat. Last Tango In Walford explores the highs and lows of Ricky and Bianca’s 13-year relationship, chronicling their explosive arguments and moving love story, including how they met, their first date, their dramatic break-up and the emotional
