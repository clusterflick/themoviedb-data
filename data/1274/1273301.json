It presents some of the country's most innovative thinkers who mix economics with psychology. Their experiments and insights into our financial behavior enlighten and often amuse as we learn to recognize how both our brains and the marketplace can trick us into spending money we shouldn't. The program explores a whole raft of techniques, apps, websites and ways of thinking that help us to save for the types of things that make our lives more secure: emergency funds, our kids' education, and ultimately our comfortable retirements. A mix of fascinating theory and practical takeaways, Thinking Money is designed to decrease the stress and increase the bandwidth in not just our finance, but our whole lives.","popularity":0.3323,"poster_path":"/uSy7ElKTcz69xwREY1JwrfFFU0e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":202997,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rocket Media Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thinking Money: The Psychology Behind Our Best and Worst Financial Decisions","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4647683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Coyne","original_name":"Dave Coyne","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"661835ec356a71017ba53911","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1899468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Feliu","original_name":"Tom Feliu","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66183551dbf1440163856a02","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1899469,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Skip Coblyn","original_name":"Skip Coblyn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66183664967cc701873aa849","department":"Production","job":"Coordinating Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2333094,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Greco","original_name":"John Greco","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6618355d8c3159016490e138","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2333094,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Greco","original_name":"John Greco","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6618366ec51acd018919a498","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1899471,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ward LeHardy","original_name":"Ward LeHardy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6618367b84448e0162939365","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4133231,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jonathan Cohen","original_name":"Jonathan Cohen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6618383584448e01629393c3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4647692,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Leslie Ralston-Rakow","original_name":"Leslie Ralston-Rakow","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6618368f356a71017ba5395f","department":"Production","job":"Coordinating Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4647718,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dennis Boni","original_name":"Dennis Boni","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661838c784448e01629393f8","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1899473,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Scott Snider","original_name":"Scott Snider","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66183765a06efe017b2da191","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2247760,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andy Kuester","original_name":"Andy Kuester","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661838db0c12550163242ed0","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1734453,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Stefan Wiesen","original_name":"Stefan Wiesen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661836aebd588b0148110298","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1757355,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Charles Sovek","original_name":"Charles Sovek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6618387e356a71017ba53a46","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5769784","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uSy7ElKTcz69xwREY1JwrfFFU0e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
