The son of a poor schoolmaster made a name for himself as a portraitist and became best known for his satirical etchings. In strange and graphic tales, such as A Harlot's Progress, he denounced the social and political injustices of his time. Often pirated, Hogarth fought for the first image copyright law. Together with illustrators and writers from today, Andrew Graham-Dixon explores Hogarth's birth city London and recounts the life and work of a man who is regarded as the forerunner of modern caricature.","popularity":0.0873,"poster_path":"/6Ubey8CUQqanyqTDOlcIsGCwFB8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hogarth's Progress","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Graham-Dixon","original_name":"Andrew Graham-Dixon","popularity":0.0905,"profile_path":"/jOSkqBq9pJHz49P4906AdRMgGXl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66194e6daf3da6017c19157b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1485153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roger Parsons","original_name":"Roger Parsons","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66194e88af3da6017c191590","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Graham-Dixon","original_name":"Andrew Graham-Dixon","popularity":0.0905,"profile_path":"/jOSkqBq9pJHz49P4906AdRMgGXl.jpg","credit_id":"66194e99e4c9eb01632a8e2b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32098560","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6Ubey8CUQqanyqTDOlcIsGCwFB8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
