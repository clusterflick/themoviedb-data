This husband and wife raised her by the good book. But this natural born killer, Kiera is always teetering on the balance of right and wrong while blurring the lines of sanity. Her parents are then murdered by a terrorist organization, leaving her heartbroken and questioning her faith. Inheriting everything, Kiera never has to worry about money again. The death of her parents causes her to contemplate her life. This leads to her understanding of her true destiny which is ridding the earth of all of its evil. Always hanging in the balance of right and wrong, Kiera will make those who hurt animals pay the ultimate price, their life. Kiera is now on a mission from God, or so she believes and Kiera will find them, she always does.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":225927,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vaccaro Creative","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's an Animal Attraction","title":"Tales of a Scorpio's Stinger","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3888976,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Evelyn O.
