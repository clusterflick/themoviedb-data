Disturbed by the impact of human activity on the environment, she wants to use humour to raise awareness. But people around her, even her own family, are sceptical. Just as Cassandra predicted the fall of Troy without being heeded, Sandra predicts the imminent approach of a terrible tragedy but no one is listening.  Belgian composer Bernard Foccroulle, former director of La Monnaie and the Festival d'Aix-en-Provence, has chosen a highly topical theme for his first opera: ecological activism in the face of societal inertia. Cassandra's predictions may not have been heeded, but her story has been avidly read for over two thousand years.","popularity":0.0454,"poster_path":"/AddCQx1AhyzphYLjJz4dAkfAbVl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cassandra - FOCCROULLE","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1703853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katarina Bradic","original_name":"Katarina Bradic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"661a68f769eb90017cb83505","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4650641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessica Niles","original_name":"Jessica Niles","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"661a68fe2cde9801870a1961","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2165757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Bickley","original_name":"Susan Bickley","popularity":0.0421,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"661a690515c636014b43ea35","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4650642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Defrise","original_name":"Sarah Defrise","popularity":0.0752,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"661a690dd0b434017d89321d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1192933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Appleby","original_name":"Paul Appleby","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"661a6916af6e940163eceda3","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1950705,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kazushi Ono","original_name":"Kazushi Ono","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661a6924d0b434016488f6f2","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2951632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie-Ève Signeyrole","original_name":"Marie-Ève Signeyrole","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661a692e15c636014b43ea3f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1536,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AddCQx1AhyzphYLjJz4dAkfAbVl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1024}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
