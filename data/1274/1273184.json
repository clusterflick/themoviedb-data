Until, that is, an argument about housekeeping causes a rift in the young people’s marriage and Peter dramatically leaves home – determined never to return. Soon after, Inga’s uncle from America announces his arrival, and she persuades Pingel to pretend to be Peter, whom the uncle has been looking forward to meeting. However, Uncle Buller immediately becomes suspicious of the strangely tense couple, and when the real Peter suddenly comes home, keeping up the deception becomes increasingly difficult.
