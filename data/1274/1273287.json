How is the family supposed to get by without their wages? The war has scarred this generation, but now things are supposed to be looking up. The workers want their fair share and are fighting for an income that also gives them room to live. In October 1956, 34,000 metalworkers in the shipyards and factories of Schleswig-Holstein walk off the job to fight for justice and their dignity. This strike is still regarded as the toughest and longest in Germany. Employers and politicians stand in the strikers' way.","popularity":0.8136,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":225916,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eikon Nord","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":7201,"logo_path":"/ljV8ZT3CIYCEIEDlTyBliXJVCZr.png","name":"NDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":124,"logo_path":"/7MjDMOybX0D3fcIEpCyY9es5XZU.png","name":"SWR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1775,"logo_path":"/ilL857W1zhtnudzvdlxrjIqLAvs.png","name":"Radio Bremen","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2024-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Mutigen 56 - Deutschlands längster Streik","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"114 - Der große Streik","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1816856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Schimrigk","original_name":"Anna Schimrigk","popularity":0.209,"profile_path":"/eDsS21XcnsGELBC2A81GIVJ1lg6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Emma Freese","credit_id":"66182a69e295b4016051d12a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Bredin","original_name":"David Bredin","popularity":0.3484,"profile_path":"/xtlq8um74buz4apunl5jQbtYo2o.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Alfred Freese","credit_id":"66182a72356a71017ba5340a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1847539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Wegener","original_name":"Claire Wegener","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Gerda Freese","credit_id":"66182a83e295b4018351d260","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3907171,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maju Margrit Sartorius","original_name":"Maju Margrit Sartorius","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Aunt Margit","credit_id":"66182a880c1255017c242c13","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1509766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bettina Hoppe","original_name":"Bettina Hoppe","popularity":0.1335,"profile_path":"/dHVjuatiw96M9xGvZGtjnKcmtwc.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Anni Wadle","credit_id":"66182a92fb83460149f6819e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronald Kukulies","original_name":"Ronald Kukulies","popularity":0.2989,"profile_path":"/f9pkqmtpx7lsfHjWcawEdujJKu1.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Hein Wadle","credit_id":"66182a9c84448e0162939106","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1108268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Herbrechter","original_name":"Max Herbrechter","popularity":0.2589,"profile_path":"/2382bAd6P62X1YRBlgXxB9RF2nq.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Adolf Westphal","credit_id":"66182aa8a06efe01622d9ac3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1819333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Sikorski","original_name":"Peter Sikorski","popularity":0.1573,"profile_path":"/9b7UG09iZecMOtiI8kGFhQS2uYw.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Julius Bredenbeck","credit_id":"66182ab2fb83460163f6825e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David C.
