All highlighted in a evocative and poetic setting, the characters deliver on different themes; self-image, eating disorders, anxiety, their first love, their first kiss, friendship, sorority, sex, rape, incest, social media, social and political revolts. Constructed as a symphony form, the piece of work goes through four movements and is musically supported. The strong visual identity forces the movie to define itself somewhere between full feature film and object of art. Sweet Sixteen is a cinematographic adaptation done by Alexa-Jeanne Dubé from the play of the same name written in 2018 by the late Suzie Bastien.","popularity":0.4342,"poster_path":"/comrgyILVyEjP16PBmcu4bgApqX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140114,"logo_path":"/698xcYut47M1BexvtGKmKX3Yf0a.png","name":"h264","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2023-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sweet
