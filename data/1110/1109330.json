The story begins at an unknown moment in the future, when the dream of the Palestinian refugees to go back to Palestine becomes reality. The film balances on the thin line between fiction and documentary, between dream and reality. Families are preparing for their fictional return, while it slowly becomes clear that this dream is far removed from their daily life in the camp. Through the words they use as actors to talk about the dream of returning to their homeland, we can understand more deeply what it means to them to live in exile.","popularity":0.0841,"poster_path":"/eAGGzX0FwXaHUV3oHuvcOPUoHtT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11703,"logo_path":null,"name":"KASK","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2017-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ours is a Country of Words","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3996127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohammad Abbas","original_name":"Mohammad Abbas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"642de40d0d2f5300b6cbd6c6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3996130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naim Abbas","original_name":"Naim Abbas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"642de41f158c8501031faba2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3996132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohammad Hassan","original_name":"Mohammad Hassan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"642de42c54a8ac0ac23d61b6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3996134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Farah Hendawi","original_name":"Farah Hendawi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"642de438c9dbf900d50ca741","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3996135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hanan Hendawi","original_name":"Hanan Hendawi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"642de442a6a4c100b6d5b19f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3996137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamal Hendawi","original_name":"Jamal Hendawi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"642de44e54a8ac0b57586a43","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3996138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mona Hendawi","original_name":"Mona Hendawi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"642de458c9dbf900b60a146f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3996139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Omran Kablawi","original_name":"Omran Kablawi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"642de461158c8501031fabb8","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3996140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohammad Zayat","original_name":"Mohammad Zayat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"642de46ea6a4c10077ed4b0b","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3996142,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mathijs Poppe","original_name":"Mathijs Poppe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65491cc32866fa00ab122c9a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3114952,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elisa Heene","original_name":"Elisa Heene","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642de4b4a6a4c100d5f3a35c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3996142,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mathijs Poppe","original_name":"Mathijs Poppe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642de4dd58361b0077b888a7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3273076,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joachim Vansteelant","original_name":"Joachim Vansteelant","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642de4f82dc44e0104e31d4d","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3996142,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mathijs Poppe","original_name":"Mathijs Poppe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642de490158c8500bdcbc274","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8546060","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eAGGzX0FwXaHUV3oHuvcOPUoHtT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Film Fest Gent","release_date":"2017-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
