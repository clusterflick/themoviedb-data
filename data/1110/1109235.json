Using 1940's newsreels to examine the picture portrayed of women in the welfare state, the reality of the 1980s is discussed by women from Tyneside. The reality of their lives contrasts sharply with the hopes and aspirations of the 40s and 50s, shown through films and songs of the period when the welfare state was first established.","popularity":0.0662,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":28323,"logo_path":null,"name":"British Film Institute Production Board","origin_country":""},{"id":183251,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trade Films Ltd","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1986-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mothers Don't Forget: Women and the Welfare State","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1262732,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne Cottringer","original_name":"Anne Cottringer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642da9ac158c8500e0b80135","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1365602,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Esther Ronay","original_name":"Esther Ronay","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642da9c054a8ac0aba5fe5de","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1324945,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ingrid Sinclair","original_name":"Ingrid Sinclair","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642da943158c8501031f99e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3995748,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marion Dain","original_name":"Marion Dain","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642da9cf0d2f530097375a14","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-02-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
