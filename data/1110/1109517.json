Ferhat, an unappointed teacher from Mardin (a city on the Türkiye-Syria border,) and his cousin Emrah, an aspiring teacher, work as bricklayers in construction sites, just like their grandfathers and fathers had been doing for decades. They are obliged to this job until a better option becomes available. Overwhelmed with concerns over their future and the tough working conditions, they both dream of a different life, hoping to break the vicious cycle of construction work. From workers’ dormitories to protests and occupation of construction sites, we get glimpses of their lives, hearing stories of struggle, resistance and solidarity, against the backdrop of a city in transformation.","popularity":0.1014,"poster_path":"/nbOPSMw00kGbSnRhebVFuuG9TJn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drifting","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3996807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emrah Atsiz","original_name":"Emrah Atsiz","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"642e8ce40d2f53011361b08c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3996808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ferhat Atsiz","original_name":"Ferhat Atsiz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"642e8ced0d2f5300f4f7cddf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3996809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tunahan Atsiz","original_name":"Tunahan Atsiz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"642e8cf72dc44e0104e36c73","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3779380,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Somnur Vardar","original_name":"Somnur Vardar","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642e8d07c9dbf90113de7cd8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2883746,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sedat Şahin","original_name":"Sedat Şahin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642e8d1554a8ac0b5758c0cf","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1784823,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eytan İpeker","original_name":"Eytan İpeker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642e8d242dc44e012711f7a3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3779380,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Somnur Vardar","original_name":"Somnur Vardar","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642e8d2fc9dbf90113de7cec","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1784256,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Cenker Kökten","original_name":"Cenker Kökten","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642e8d3e0d2f53009737baba","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3779380,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Somnur Vardar","original_name":"Somnur Vardar","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642e8d4e158c8500771136c6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nbOPSMw00kGbSnRhebVFuuG9TJn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Antalya Film Festival","release_date":"2022-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
