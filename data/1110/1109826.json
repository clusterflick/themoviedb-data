After some weeks I caught dengue fever and was flown out to Darwin. This is my fractured fever memory of Timor and its people in ruins shot on super eight film, a lot of it while riding a bicycle.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walking in Timor East - Makan Itu Batu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3997935,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Cooper","original_name":"Mike Cooper","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642f529fe92d8300b6e3d67d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
