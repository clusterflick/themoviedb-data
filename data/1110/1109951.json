I guess this is how I think about myself too. That I will go back to Lisbon soon. But I often find myself doubting it and becoming a kind of split self. Because now with this crisis and the very controversial austerity IMF program running in Portugal I found most of my friends leaving Lisbon; and family about to mortgage their homes. I wanted to talk about this feeling of separation that I see in my generation, about this state of being in between an apparent solid past and an unknown future, about this identity in transition.","popularity":0.3286,"poster_path":"/4LdINzzi9QcwlI0mbe9RLOhJr32.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31052,"logo_path":"/pJgQoO1PyJdhOP1UOrVsDeolYw7.png","name":"Deutsche Film- und Fernsehakademie Berlin (DFFB)","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Silence Between Two Songs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","title":"戀曲休止符","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1128122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miguel Nunes","original_name":"Miguel Nunes","popularity":0.111,"profile_path":"/sKGvhpt2P2O9XjriVYWUFk3vjFF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lucas","credit_id":"642fd18a310325009a20c119","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1037854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joana de Verona","original_name":"Joana de Verona","popularity":0.189,"profile_path":"/kvHgSdSIWMgYcBDnndAJhP59cil.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Laura","credit_id":"642fd1961f98d10268b16c2e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":149126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniela Schulz","original_name":"Daniela Schulz","popularity":0.2038,"profile_path":"/m9qqJYBlgMNLwIqknYyvO9JKL9C.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Johanna","credit_id":"642fd3851f98d101cba5a53f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3701394,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Xenia Brauer","original_name":"Xenia Brauer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6432845ae92d8300d59d6f73","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1554762,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Norwin Hatschbach","original_name":"Norwin Hatschbach","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642fd1f79a643506ab77d326","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1849790,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mónica Lima","original_name":"Mónica Lima","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642fd1356dea3a00d436c670","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1849791,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gonçalo Branco","original_name":"Gonçalo Branco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642fd12231032500e0dc389c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1849790,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mónica Lima","original_name":"Mónica Lima","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642fd05695c0af00b62189bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3531278","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4LdINzzi9QcwlI0mbe9RLOhJr32.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1059}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":220,"name":"berlin, germany"},{"id":18013,"name":"separation"},{"id":18027,"name":"sibling"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kuan-Du Film Festival","release_date":"2023-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
