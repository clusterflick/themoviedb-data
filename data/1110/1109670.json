The documentary examines the close bond that Milow has with his fans and for the first time gives a glimpse of his personal life, as an example, revealing that he has 2 young children. In 'Great To Know You' the viewer discovers why Milow chooses to sing and talk about his personal life. The death of his drummer Oscar Kraal forced Milow to shift his focus and allow his private life more clearly into his songs. The film was made by Lieven Bulckens, a childhood friend of Milow, and that personal connection brings the viewer close to the singer-songwriter's creative process and his life in Belgium and Los Angeles.","popularity":0.0739,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Great To Know You - a documentary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milow","original_name":"Milow","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":"/oTZV9LTMmj8p1hP2MzfXcFNq7kt.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Milow","credit_id":"642f0ef4ce4ddc00b6913039","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1342,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wXvepMqILZuuEueWD4Oy1SRRE4W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2386}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":246377,"name":"music documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Milow - Great To Know You (Documentary)","key":"H1rGRy1AqNI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2023-04-04T21:05:43.000Z","id":"642f0eb34544af007778fc21"}]}}}
