This reality is seen through Alessia Cinquegrana, born as Giovanni, 29, the first trans bride in Italy, and Alessandro, 25, an actor and drag queen, an activist in the Neapolitan LGBT world.","popularity":0.0437,"poster_path":"/oGfnyi1HbVKNk9xNjKTk6BzD7Pg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nata Femmena","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3995115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alessia Cinquegrana","original_name":"Alessia Cinquegrana","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/gYPwOTVfsQiYTFPiGBQAgC22x28.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"642d408c64765400f2be1138","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3995116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alessandro Saggiomo","original_name":"Alessandro Saggiomo","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/pnWV7yF7W8Tvm6qEpd1AVwq05H1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"642d409958361b00f2f08a23","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enzo Moscato","original_name":"Enzo Moscato","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":"/86J116rQ6mB9ypBNyZOFcllUpfn.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"642d864b0d2f5300973747f7","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3995118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pasquale Formicola","original_name":"Pasquale Formicola","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/k6Voqvf1ATXPOFByCLIG0PR6ASm.jpg","credit_id":"642d40e0158c8501031f6c3f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3995119,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elisabetta Rasicci","original_name":"Elisabetta Rasicci","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/n5Q22p9U3HryMkzI529qCJoOwzp.jpg","credit_id":"642d40ea58361b009501494c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eIt3bob5aP6u3jbTwAaMy5Pxp54.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/oGfnyi1HbVKNk9xNjKTk6BzD7Pg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
