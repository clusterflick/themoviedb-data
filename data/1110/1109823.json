When I released my c.d. Globe Notes a musician friend said it reminded him of a trip to Bali as a child being transported, half asleep, half dreaming, part awake, through the Balinese  countryside at night by bicycle rickshaw. The audio is from a recording of my live soundtrack performance for the silent film 'Legong' that I performed for Across Asia Film Festiva at the MAXXI in Rome June 2014.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/bBEO32BXVPHZLVeUC5CUD1F0mHV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walking in Bali","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3997935,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Cooper","original_name":"Mike Cooper","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642f51d767203d0126ac54f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bBEO32BXVPHZLVeUC5CUD1F0mHV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
