A lo-fi comedy that’s both an ode to bike ownership and a depiction of the heartaches that come with it. Having had her bike stolen several times before, she travels with pre-made “Missing Bike” flyers and an “In Case of Emergency” packet that walks her through a strategy to retrieve her wheels ASAP. But she’s not the only one in her situation.","popularity":0.27,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bike Thief","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3997925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leanne Velednitsky","original_name":"Leanne Velednitsky","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Leanne","credit_id":"642f4b5e1f98d10222205fe3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3997926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brigitte Williamson","original_name":"Brigitte Williamson","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Lover","credit_id":"642f4b72310325009a2085d0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1203090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sahana Srinivasan","original_name":"Sahana Srinivasan","popularity":0.4219,"profile_path":"/uDFHXRMbPY5YwjpXgxZB9MNcLSu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Thief","credit_id":"642f4ba3e92d830077f74c83","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3810636,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yvette Lu","original_name":"Yvette Lu","popularity":0.2265,"profile_path":"/d4ADp9kVWRBXR9jAH7bh4bJ9tV7.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Annoying Couple #1","credit_id":"642f4bdc1f98d101f644f365","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1475365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicholas McDonald","original_name":"Nicholas McDonald","popularity":0.0418,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Annoying Couple #2","credit_id":"642f4bfd6dea3a00d436874e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3997928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robin Privman","original_name":"Robin Privman","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mom","credit_id":"642f4c201f98d10268b12f79","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3810636,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yvette Lu","original_name":"Yvette Lu","popularity":0.2265,"profile_path":"/d4ADp9kVWRBXR9jAH7bh4bJ9tV7.jpg","credit_id":"642f4c8b67203d00e0812c14","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3997925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leanne Velednitsky","original_name":"Leanne Velednitsky","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642f4cfe373ac2007770e750","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3997925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leanne Velednitsky","original_name":"Leanne Velednitsky","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642f4cb96dea3a00f396b080","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3997930,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arisa Olazabal","original_name":"Arisa Olazabal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642f4ce76dea3a0112e37bd2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3997925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leanne Velednitsky","original_name":"Leanne Velednitsky","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642f4d6e310325009a208640","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3997933,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Matt Larson","original_name":"Matt Larson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642f4d5e373ac200d36bf4ad","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3997934,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Dana Roth","original_name":"Dana Roth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642f4d8be92d830097c49bb7","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3997925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leanne Velednitsky","original_name":"Leanne Velednitsky","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642f4c9f6dea3a0076bc2c31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3997932,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Iliana Ipes","original_name":"Iliana Ipes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642f4d2995c0af00b6214c24","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
