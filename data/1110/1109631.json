Between France and Germany, this documentary compiles the testimonies of ordinary people who tell their often traumatic experiences: Charlotte and Linda, who were brutalized in broad daylight in front of their daughter's eyes; Max, a high school student targeted by an anonymous cyber-stalker; Arnaud, victim of a violent assault in the middle of Paris; Tessa Ganserer, elected to the Bundestag, exposed to transphobic hate campaigns on the Internet; Ria and Leo, confronted with \"queerphobia\" mixed with racism... Activists or not, they all aspire to normality, to safety and to have society stop turning a blind eye to what they suffer.","popularity":0.1186,"poster_path":"/ljiGEST9KFYx31LGAGlWDfb45lP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hass gegen Queer","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"La violence anti-queer","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1761658,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tristan Ferland Milewski","original_name":"Tristan Ferland Milewski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642ef5fbce4ddc00f4ea6649","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27502607","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/x1487I5rYUHKi43UkS0YgjKKOho.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/ja1UBoF4dFLOLW9SibblosQyM4R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/ljiGEST9KFYx31LGAGlWDfb45lP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ARTE","release_date":"2023-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
