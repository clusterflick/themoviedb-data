Co-directed by French-Rwandan musician and author Gaël Faye and director Michael Sztanke, this movie records with sensitivity and for the first time the testimonies of Prisca, Marie-Jeanne and Concessa about their lives during the genocide and after.  The three Tutsi women tell the camera about their daily lives during the genocide and in the refugee camps of Murambi and Nyarushishi, where they lived a nightmare under the guard of the French soldiers of the Opération Turquoise who, under a UN mandate, where supposed to protect them. While the French army denies any rape accusation, the three women filed complaints with the French justice system in 2004 and 2012. The investigation is now at a standstill.","popularity":0.3271,"poster_path":"/6Rwx67nouWfs3yPpKgYVLs5SOkI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77627,"logo_path":"/PffGbh9Pc1Y7e1htSi3L1BpPsR.png","name":"BABEL
