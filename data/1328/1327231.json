On the day of her final exam, a practicing physician (Zio) unexpectedly brings his niece (Rose) to one of his house calls proclaiming she will act as the doctor on his behalf, in order to save the life of an elderly woman at the cusp of deathâ€¦the only problem is she has chosen today to die.  A dark comedic drama at its core, the film is set within the absurdity of a Felliniesque daydream.
