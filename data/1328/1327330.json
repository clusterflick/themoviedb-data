Although the forest is infested with desperate characters, Freckles shows courage and determination. A beautiful girl whom he calls the \"Swamp Angel\" and the \"Bird Woman\" assist him in driving off timber thief Wessner and his gang. Later, Freckles refuses a bribe Wessner offers if he will permit Wessner to steal some trees. Instead, Freckles gives Wessner a beating, and his loyalty to McLean earns him a cash reward. Freckles falls in love with the Swamp Angel, but the social differences between him and the girl prevent him from declaring himself. He makes no attempt to recover when a large tree falls and seriously injures him. His recuperation is hastened, however, when the girl expresses her love for him.","popularity":0.4312,"poster_path":"/vPJ6urTRCEeYIMiGJWroVB9ripj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42359,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Booking Offices of America (FBO)","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1928-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"TEN MILLION READERS WEPT, LAUGHED- THRILLED TO IT!
