The blood trail leads to a mutilated body. The body is her boyfriend lying in the corner of the room. Obviously frightened, she still mysteriously knows where she is and whom an ominous, forceful voice on an intercom belongs to. It's her father's voice. She stays in the room as punishment, and how long until she gets out she doesn't know. Hours become days. Days become weeks. In the room, Sam finds solace in talking to her nine-year-old sister through a latch built into the bottom of the room's door. This keeps herself occupied and her mind focused to prevent reoccurring flashes she has of her late mother's death. Meanwhile, the voice gives her instructions to take white pills that put her to sleep. Sam slowly pieces together fragmented memories she has from her past, and begins to understand why she stays locked in this room, for what lies inside of her cannot be let free.","popularity":0.2875,"poster_path":"/wB1MnlxG9lPHFZNWt0Nb1DTzKcK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":235921,"logo_path":null,"name":"Good Cop Bad Cop Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":235922,"logo_path":null,"name":"Concerted Audio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In the room, lies Sam.
