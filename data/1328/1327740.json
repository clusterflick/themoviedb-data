In this powerful adaptation of George Orwell's 1984, we dive into a dystopian world that painfully echoes the everyday reality of the Mexican people.  Freedom is slavery, war is peace, ignorance is strength… and Big Brother is always watching you. Any resemblance to reality is not coincidental.","popularity":0.0579,"poster_path":"/geHPpldRkVp4l5IvnPtth2Wj4Y7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Based on 1984, the timeless classic by George Orwell.","title":"2 MINUTES OF HATE","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1659073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mauro Sánchez Navarro","original_name":"Mauro Sánchez Navarro","popularity":0.1023,"profile_path":"/hZIgaYKSTl1HnxcyH3L4Ucm648t.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Winston Smith","credit_id":"66b6906655896af2c87abe71","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2092476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karla Rodríguez Coronado","original_name":"Karla Rodríguez Coronado","popularity":0.0909,"profile_path":"/ll0jiVSdiKB3kW6k3DbmwIOUzOP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Julia Sterling","credit_id":"66b69081a84c4b86744496b8","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4876752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diego Ramírez G.","original_name":"Diego Ramírez G.","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/v41ZBrby3yAC6weqdyFIE3fqjlb.jpg","credit_id":"66b690d91f7c188902c5eff5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4876823,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Edgar Desfassiaux","original_name":"Edgar Desfassiaux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b69a870d3ecd24f1280cc8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4876752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diego Ramírez G.","original_name":"Diego Ramírez G.","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/v41ZBrby3yAC6weqdyFIE3fqjlb.jpg","credit_id":"66b69c656cc9ee7dc09ebf8a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4876817,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hector Zúñiga","original_name":"Hector Zúñiga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b699f6e2d0d56a81a769f3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4876822,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Emilio Ávila Bolio","original_name":"Emilio Ávila Bolio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b69a6c6f5a3971749ebf3b","department":"Sound","job":"Music Score Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4876752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diego Ramírez G.","original_name":"Diego Ramírez G.","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/v41ZBrby3yAC6weqdyFIE3fqjlb.jpg","credit_id":"66b69a3ed3593a82dc2709c5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32863807","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2963,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/geHPpldRkVp4l5IvnPtth2Wj4Y7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"2 MINUTOS DE ODIO | TRAILER","key":"KpQ0dZHscgk","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-12-23T21:49:19.000Z","id":"66b6999e1c77f229020161d6"}]}}}
