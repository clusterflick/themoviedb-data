We follow not only the protagonist's family affairs, but also her complex social network. Romina's story could be repeated identically in any Western metropolis because it reflects a universal reality: the precariousness of suburban life today. Through Berta's imprisonment, the injustice of the prison system - a controversial aspect of our society - materializes. Romina offers a realistic portrait of urban life, made up of social fragility, precarity and prison.","popularity":0.0466,"poster_path":"/ig2RNsDjTGqbvzi2RKvtyGZHjzU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":236025,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fase 3","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2024-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Romina","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4877233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Romina Cabezas","original_name":"Romina Cabezas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"self","credit_id":"66b7113f6cc9ee7dc09edb6d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4877234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Berta Irene Navarrete Yacelga","original_name":"Berta Irene Navarrete Yacelga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"self","credit_id":"66b71149d7bd8c34d5c60df6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4877235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alessandro Danè","original_name":"Alessandro Danè","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"self","credit_id":"66b7115283a55fb98c017abd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4877236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Gonzales","original_name":"Alan Gonzales","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"self","credit_id":"66b7115ce6d5e0fb48262072","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4877237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stanislao Junior Luzzi","original_name":"Stanislao Junior Luzzi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"self","credit_id":"66b71165ecc808bbc9c60a00","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4877239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franco Palmieri","original_name":"Franco Palmieri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"self","credit_id":"66b7116d7785ad53942619f4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4877240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pamela Malvina Noutcho Sawa","original_name":"Pamela Malvina Noutcho Sawa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"self","credit_id":"66b711775cd039dee8261c7e","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4877243,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Petrolini","original_name":"Michael Petrolini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b71193d00666c92ca7b27e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4877242,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valerio Lo Muzio","original_name":"Valerio Lo Muzio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b7118a26205aee63f42948","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4877242,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valerio Lo Muzio","original_name":"Valerio Lo Muzio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b7118119c13a21529ed8fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4877244,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emiliano Trovati","original_name":"Emiliano Trovati","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b7119a7d739ff29e9eda2a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30790939","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/ig2RNsDjTGqbvzi2RKvtyGZHjzU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Biografilm","release_date":"2024-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
