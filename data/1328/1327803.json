They perform a ritual. Christopher Juul, Maria Franz, Kai Uwe Faust and their Nordic collective sweep audiences into rapture with throat singing, primordial rhythms, subtle electronic textures, a mesmerizing light show, an army of warriors and bursts of fire. What better place on earth to experience their ancient ritual than the Red Rocks Amphitheatre? The world-famous venue - which is located outside of Denver, Colorado in the USA, tucked between two giant sandstones - was once home to indigenous tribes. When HEILUNG performed there in October 2021, they recognized this history by inviting Natives to join the prayer that opens all of their rituals. “Remember that we all are brothers. All people, beasts, trees, and stones, and wind. We all descend from the one great being”. What followed was a night that no one would forget. Experience the magic of HEILUNG’s very first Red Rocks performance again and again!","popularity":0.0423,"poster_path":"/wYFIU2nUHjELXRs03BRpCppIyoN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heilung: LIFA Iotungard -  Live at Red Rocks Amphitheatre","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2647041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heilung","original_name":"Heilung","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/1y177yzLxNu4MV0hIfTuXTjhvXU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66b6cfd67df27319652831f0","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wYFIU2nUHjELXRs03BRpCppIyoN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"performed in October 2021, at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre which is located outside of Denver, Colorado - USA.","release_date":"2024-08-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
