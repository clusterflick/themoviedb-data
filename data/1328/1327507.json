While the old man continues to play cards with his pals, Rigadin and the young wife go into a room; the husband soon follows and kicks him out. But when he dons a different hat, he isn't recognized.  It's a very slight addition to Prince's series as Rigadin, and at times seems a trifle incoherent to modern viewers, most of whom have never seen a formal hat of any description. Instead they will notice the pulled faces and painted backdrops, as Prince tries and fails to make this minor one-reel comedy more interesting. With Suzanne Demay and Armand Lurville.","popularity":0.0823,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1912-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rigadin, Garçon de Banque","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1040618,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Prince","original_name":"Charles Prince","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/xIJtjes51xjkr6VjEz50sbPv0Yi.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Rigadin","credit_id":"66b6044d9502837abf1253ba","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11598,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Armand Lurville","original_name":"Armand Lurville","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":"/kxdxMGbaunHLYOrDj6bfcIk6jkX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66b6045ecf10bee8a8c5ee2b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1869485,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suzanne Demay","original_name":"Suzanne Demay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66b6046c6c58a2eb5ca765d0","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1268213,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Monca","original_name":"Georges Monca","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b604ad60ff276b63a76747","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0427779","wikidata_id":"Q59140056","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1912-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Rigadin, garçon de banque (1912) Pathé","key":"g2c-D7yM-ks","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2024-08-07T23:14:38.000Z","id":"66b6051fed1e7bef68455814"}]}}}
