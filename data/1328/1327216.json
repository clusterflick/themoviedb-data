With the permanent damming of the Xingu River in 2015, the quantity, speed, and level of water in the region no longer derive from the natural flow of the river, but rather from the company operating the Belo Monte Dam: Norte Energia. Through the so-called \"Consensus Hydrogram,\" the company will control the volume of water that passes through the dam's gates, flowing down the Volta Grande do Xingu. The Juruna (Yudjá) people closely monitor the region and warn of the risks of this change: the disappearance of plant and animal species, some of which are endemic, and the consequences for the survival of their people. They have already proven that the proposed hydrogram is insufficient to sustain life in the region and demand that it be revised.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Xingu's Rio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
