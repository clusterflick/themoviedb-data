A handdrawn animation of a ghostly bman flying above the top of a cinema where \"Man on Roof\" is playing, only to be shot and killed by a police helicopter. An audience laughs at his dying body. The curtain falls and the audience begins asking to play the animation again, so the film reverses and plays again, only for two critics to speak over the film, debating whether the animation is a political statement.","popularity":0.0815,"poster_path":"/mAiv3OoW9l7m2rc7EvK5Llt6FxK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Man on Roof","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4874757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Kalimanis","original_name":"John Kalimanis","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Critic","credit_id":"66b52acd243bfa6301e93a1f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4874758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Malamphy","original_name":"Paul Malamphy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Critic","credit_id":"66b52ad6b5f11c85d5adfe79","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4874759,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurie Anderson","original_name":"Laurie Anderson","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"66b52aebbd8d68f21fa748d6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2273969,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Roy Barge","original_name":"Roy Barge","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"66b52b0674993d596d422b23","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4792987,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Tony Venezia","original_name":"Tony Venezia","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"66b52b1a74993d596d422b27","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4874760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raquel Rocha","original_name":"Raquel Rocha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"66b52b2c18cc6c5364422ac0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4874761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Magdalena Rangel","original_name":"Magdalena Rangel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"66b52b353565380031c7c302","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2358332,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pam Pietroforte","original_name":"Pam Pietroforte","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"66b52b5374993d596d422b2d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4874764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan McLaughlin","original_name":"Dan McLaughlin","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"66b52b657a7f4c4bb898ed7a","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4874765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cynthia Manfred","original_name":"Cynthia Manfred","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"66b52b726e8b4c5f50d63349","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4874767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Levie","original_name":"Mark Levie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"66b52b8093a69c4daaf32844","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4874768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Katayama","original_name":"Ed Katayama","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"66b52b8b60ff276b63a748ce","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4874770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Harris","original_name":"Bill Harris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"66b52b980b7a889b6ca40c71","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4874771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfredo Grieco","original_name":"Alfredo Grieco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"66b52ba374993d596d422b38","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4874772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Giacona","original_name":"Greg Giacona","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"66b52bace4643b27e6e45251","order":14}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2868526,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Veck","original_name":"Pierre Veck","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b52aa41bb79aef6fc7c29b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2868526,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Veck","original_name":"Pierre Veck","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b52aabd0502b77d7d632f1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4874756,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Irene M.
