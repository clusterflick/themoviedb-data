The camera follows the gaze of the  characters, trained to different directions, in some cases the ground  and in others the sky, experiencing how they relate to the world  around them, the minute details they observe, and their sense of  time and place. Moving between dream and reality, the film is an  exploration of the inner and outer landscapes they encounter.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/smT8YG02IoMQPgm43ezRTzVqY0a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Running River is All Legs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3209758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"B.
