The word alone fills most people with dread. It calls to mind some kind of huge, writhing monster, lying in wait to bite. The Hungarian meadow viper (Vipera ursinii rakosiensis) however, is not large and doesn’t attack. It is rather small and it would rather flee. It’s venom is deadly only to grasshoppers and crickets. It almost disappeared because it’s habitats were plowed under and drained. It’s not easy being legless in a world ruled by four-wheeled machines and two-legged creatures. The survivors retreated to the sand dunes of Kiskunság National Park. This is where our story’s protagonist, 2K366/08, entered the world. This is her story.","popularity":0.1497,"poster_path":"/lK74TUvTBA1iYJ5oS7SNVfEK2rD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126329,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmjungle","origin_country":"HU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2014-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vipera Life – A serpent’s life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gábor Máté","original_name":"Gábor Máté","popularity":0.0785,"profile_path":"/6EF2PNZxvNsEvr1qg7q4aYMkVxW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"66b4ac97e861332165adfb3d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1667552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Attila Dávid Molnár","original_name":"Molnár Attila Dávid","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b4acae7109a27d786d0141","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1667552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Attila Dávid Molnár","original_name":"Molnár Attila Dávid","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b4acc06e0a8956bc8b6fef","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1207644,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Péter Sass","original_name":"Péter Sass","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b4acd1f9b4864ab76485f3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4874012,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tamás Belágyi","original_name":"Tamás Belágyi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b4ace32008c3c4aa648941","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4344075,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Zsolt Tamás","original_name":"Zsolt Tamás","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b4acf34112c0c659adfa77","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1667553,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Zsolt Marcell Tóth","original_name":"Tóth Zsolt Marcell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b4ad060bcb472b14e93687","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1618485,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sándor Faludi","original_name":"Sándor Faludi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b4ad7fe861332165adfb43","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3220408,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simon Koch","original_name":"Simon Koch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b4ad8c5f06c7a6bbbb8807","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4344088,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zoltán Brinner","original_name":"Zoltán Brinner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b4adda5590592fff8b70ab","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1667552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Attila Dávid Molnár","original_name":"Molnár Attila Dávid","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b4adf1720515109ce9364b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1667553,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Zsolt Marcell Tóth","original_name":"Tóth Zsolt Marcell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b4adffcf10bee8a8c5cf90","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nsDACRJ8CFcSw1JKo7d43AH1Zek.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lK74TUvTBA1iYJ5oS7SNVfEK2rD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hu","note":"","release_date":"2014-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
