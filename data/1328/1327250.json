We were transported to the crossroads between nature and culture. Calm reigns. The great spectacle of the stoic and the living unfolds continuously, before our eyes and our lenses. Between Vancouver and Calgary. Between lakes and mountains. Between forests and deserts. Time seems frozen. The fires of the past few weeks have left a hypnotic veil over the entire region. Our senses are on alert. It is in Kamloops that we are the most taken aback. The weight of memory is added to the smell of flames. We sail between sadness and wonder.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"W.E.S.T","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4874854,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cedric Cont","original_name":"Cedric Cont","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b5341bd862f7d57fd04421","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4874855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary Paitre","original_name":"Gary Paitre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b534257b652d5c0adddd1d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
