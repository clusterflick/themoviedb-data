Each iteration is a unique call and response between a virtual landscape and documentary footage. Set in a small 3D scanned region of the Badlands of South Dakota, voices carry you from paleontology to foraging, indigenous herbalism to nuclear arms, wildlife management to cattle ranching. Strata laters histories, economics, natural sciences, deep time, and personal anecdotes within an immersive landscape that invites you into a meditation on the complex histories embedded in all lands and how profoundly human perspectives shape and define their futures.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strata | a performance of topography","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2522839,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hannah  Jayanti","original_name":"Hannah  Jayanti","popularity":0.0827,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b73fda18e737c71f036d8b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2522843,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Alexander Porter","original_name":"Alexander Porter","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b73ffef44005314c073452","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Mimesis Documentary Festival","release_date":"2024-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
