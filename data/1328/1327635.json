Described as neglected outcasts on the scariest, artsiest fringes of the Vancouver punk scene. Most punks avoided them and they were often being shut down from the general public. The genre of music this trio was producing (which consisted of a female vocalist and male guitarist and bassist) was very difficult to label at that time as they produced erratic and vicious sounds of industrial/synthesizer based music, free improv and confrontational performance art mixed in with the fierce and unbearable screaming vocals of Ebra Zion.
