The title for this initial entry was taken from his longest-running strip, \"Gags and Gals\" of the several he did. This one featured, as did the others in the series, various NYC models and actresses posing in bathing suits, and various stages of getting undressed and getting dressed. Since this was 1936, those stages were usually the beginning and the end of the process.","popularity":0.1129,"poster_path":"/eWH6KwIkl0H6NyztzMiVwrIxDVs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21769,"logo_path":null,"name":"Educational Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1936-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gags and Gals","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2417172,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jefferson Machamer","original_name":"Jefferson Machamer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Jefferson Machamer, the Artist","credit_id":"5d887eec223e20002974a120","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2417173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Prudence Hayes","original_name":"Prudence Hayes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The Sketch Girl","credit_id":"5d887ef9172d7f000d4ae7f7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Al Christie","original_name":"Al Christie","popularity":0.1372,"profile_path":"/jMApCuhrAZ7wFVUF8Dl2Iti7lSp.jpg","credit_id":"5d887ec0172d7f000d4ae767","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0159454","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.737,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eWH6KwIkl0H6NyztzMiVwrIxDVs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":737}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1936-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
