Over the five difficult days it took to free Ivan, no one was closer to him, his family, and Meduza’s editorial staff than documentary filmmaker Sergey Erzhenkov and the camera crew who assisted him. In this new film from the “Black Flag,” we bring you the Golunov case through the eyes of those who were at the epicenter of these events.","popularity":0.0725,"poster_path":"/dsgpbtT21BL5BKjvSqKNyY6ZOwt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2019-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Golunov","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2417175,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Daniil Zhilinsky","original_name":"Daniil Zhilinsky","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d888243172d7f001f4ad0e8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2417177,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Larisa Svetlichnaya","original_name":"Larisa Svetlichnaya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d8882c079b3d4002781a3b7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2142343,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergey Erzhenkov","original_name":"Sergey Erzhenkov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/niBmn0kUWgElf9694PzLOfroTyy.jpg","credit_id":"5d888209223e20001074bd7f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2142343,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergey Erzhenkov","original_name":"Sergey Erzhenkov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/niBmn0kUWgElf9694PzLOfroTyy.jpg","credit_id":"5d88821879b3d4002781a2a3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2168938,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrey Vorobey","original_name":"Andrey Vorobey","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d8882f2b76cbb0017e3a977","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2417176,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alexandra Gorokhova","original_name":"Alexandra Gorokhova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d88827b79b3d4000f81af2c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2142343,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergey Erzhenkov","original_name":"Sergey Erzhenkov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/niBmn0kUWgElf9694PzLOfroTyy.jpg","credit_id":"5d88820d172d7f00174b1856","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10529882","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/dsgpbtT21BL5BKjvSqKNyY6ZOwt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
