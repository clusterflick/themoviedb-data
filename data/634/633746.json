For example, a 2003 essay, part of his ongoing project \"Title Variable\" (2001-), also investigates the New Jack Swing genre, and is itself linked to a musical album (both are available on-line; see below). Written in the style of popular music journalism, Price's essay states that \"the entire New Jack Swing venture can be seen as a producer's grab for market share, a way to assimilate an obstreperous but commercially successful youngster into the secure, decades-old structures of popular black music.\"","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nieuw Jacxz Swinjge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2404808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seth Price","original_name":"Seth Price","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d89bf5dc58acd000f2e2b7b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
