The local government reported the number of dead at 64, while a Harvard University lead study estimated 4645. This film tells the story of the research team that completed this historic study from the perspective of Dr. Domingo Marqués, the only team member to experience the hurricane firsthand. See how the local government, echoing an anti-science agenda in the broader US, reacted to the now famous study, and how a country that distrusts scientists prepares for the next catastrophic event.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/ploiHfahGdLa2waUmRrKJDJxcOi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"One hurricane, one study, thousands dead.","title":"Collapse","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2417069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Santiago Marqués","original_name":"Santiago Marqués","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d8828f0223e20001074173c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2417066,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sheilla L.
