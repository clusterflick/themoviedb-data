Mike Malloy, alternatively referred to as the “Rasputin of the Bronx”, “Durable Mike Malloy”, and “the man who couldn’t be killed”, fell victim to speakeasy owner Tony Marino and his friends as part of their plan to make some quick money during the Prohibition and Great Depression era in the Bronx. These men, learning Malloy (who was an alcoholic regular in the speakeasy) had no friends, family, or home in the city, decided to take out a life insurance plan on him and subsequently cause his “natural” death (a plan that had already worked on Marino’s girlfriend). What they didn’t expect was the resilience of Malloy. Between December 1932 and February 1933, they attempted the murder 20 times before finally succeeding, and in the process turned the story of Mike Malloy into a legend of sorts.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deoch an Dorais","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9787912","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
