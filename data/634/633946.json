Brother Jean is not a teacher like the others. He wants to interest his students in the subject and to achieve this, he conducts archaeological excavations with his students aimed at proving the establishment of a Viking colony (Vinland) on the coast of the Saint Lawrence. The superiors of his congregation do not appreciate his unconventional ways of teaching. Without knowing it, Brother Jean will have a significant impact on the lives of his students, particularly in that of Émile, a young man who is having difficulty at school and who would prefer to abandon his studies to go work in a factory.","popularity":0.5756,"poster_path":"/pNX003Bhc9N3XVCpVwHku24AwwL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94837,"logo_path":"/cVAcusLoe1Vf30yQvwgcExvuMCU.png","name":"Productions
