This history of colonial law-making forged political and sometimes profane relation- ships between humans and animals. Bambitchell’s essayistic film reimagines common perceptions of legal history and, in doing so, produces a world where past and present, fiction and non-fiction, human and animal fuse.","popularity":0.0558,"poster_path":"/psfr2e38n7SaSWzFP474lOoRdTU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bugs and Beasts Before the Law","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2024587,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sharlene Bamboat","original_name":"Sharlene Bamboat","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/5WMCX1tzj6ChVfcO1lN5dUSjeTQ.jpg","credit_id":"61e8285db513a800919f3238","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477733,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richy Carey","original_name":"Richy Carey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5deca02eeb79c20011398b12","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477733,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richy Carey","original_name":"Richy Carey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5deca042eee18600168c1859","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1142395,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Iris Ng","original_name":"Iris Ng","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5decaa0eeb79c200133992ad","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2428839,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexis Mitchell","original_name":"Alexis Mitchell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5decaa416d000c00145609fe","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/psfr2e38n7SaSWzFP474lOoRdTU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":994,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h5FiYldbtQ7ClkNjco8w0RwK9mr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
