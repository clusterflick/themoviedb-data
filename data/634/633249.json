The daily dalliances of 'Zloz' as part of the rock n' roll stage show, in front and behind the stage and in the studio, are well documented and collaborated by the stars themselves - While his 'unique' communication skills may leave a lot to be desired in the real world, the end result of his work can only be described as phenomenal. No other photographer had the access, the attitude and lifestyle to bring a seductive photo perspective, a peep show if you will, of the down and out lifestyle of rockstars through the professional lens of 'Zloz'.","popularity":0.8604,"poster_path":"/hwAGPH0AAWp7hMOZif2VjXxxcPi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25188,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rattlesnake Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Your Face: The Neil Zlozower Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1452950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Zlozower","original_name":"Neil Zlozower","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/7P5B3PRFkP1eOAShMW9DOI0yzHw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d87a2c8b76cbb0027e1c101","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chad Smith","original_name":"Chad Smith","popularity":0.4609,"profile_path":"/2Ubkwfy27jrewWkMw1MHS34iQIN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d87a6315a469000109d3eb7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Rollins","original_name":"Henry Rollins","popularity":0.8415,"profile_path":"/2E0cZdoJsdt1Lv4waG3s6fsfJeU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d87a643172d7f001f49522c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Satriani","original_name":"Joe Satriani","popularity":0.4749,"profile_path":"/kdwpo3Cx5VHdAQWrfFiNjg8gz56.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d87a658172d7f001f495244","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Stanley","original_name":"Paul Stanley","popularity":0.4513,"profile_path":"/tcPAc5YiW5yjzlfqs8zwohAMaIp.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d87a665336e010011179a76","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Vai","original_name":"Steve Vai","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":"/fnXN8KGFMjAZ9aI5N7GpZBVBVMs.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d87a66d5a469000199d0cbd","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zakk Wylde","original_name":"Zakk Wylde","popularity":0.1436,"profile_path":"/ckulx8w9BEGWcT5ZBhs3egSTxU0.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d87a67a223e2000297342fa","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2416818,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Declan Maynes","original_name":"Declan Maynes","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d87a6a65a469000299d0c54","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2416817,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beate Maynes","original_name":"Beate Maynes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d87a695b76cbb0017e2229a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8236200","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4BgVWriDRhLaXoXZmxterUdbAqn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":968,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hwAGPH0AAWp7hMOZif2VjXxxcPi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":645}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Manchester Film Festival","release_date":"2018-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Beverly Hills Film Festival","release_date":"2018-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"IN YOUR FACE - The Neil Zlozower Story - Official Trailer 2","key":"nW1sujMHkuY","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-08-23T14:12:59.000Z","id":"5f8a39a7238513003638a4bf"}]}}}
