Liquid and gravitational reality. Cosmic energy. Atomized Rhythm.  Neurons of a liberated unconscious. Elimination of the idea of \"soul\" as \"everything\", reducing it to the condition of units of energy in perpetual process, elementary particles, without duration, that arise in perfect dependence. The \"I\" as a stream of units of force in ceaseless becoming that procures the illusion of an entity. Karmic chain. The idea that eternity resides in the transitory, the eternal belongs to it instantly. Eternity not as infinite duration but as absence of temporality. Universe of a mobile, procedural, relational and interactive nature of everything that exists. Here the \"object\" is conceived as something that is constituted, completed, lost and recovered with the vibrating rhythm of a universe in constant production.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/f1M5zE0YITMaS3RnHpM5A4uWiys.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13853,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zeitun Films","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2014-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Galician","iso_639_1":"gl","name":"Galego"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Magma (C)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1736406,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carla Andrade","original_name":"Carla Andrade","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d8a68d1172d7f000d4ecae1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2417990,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jonathan Kawchuk","original_name":"Jonathan Kawchuk","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d8a68e5172d7f000d4ecaef","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.625,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f1M5zE0YITMaS3RnHpM5A4uWiys.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2014-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
