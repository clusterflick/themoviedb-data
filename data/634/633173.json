While she has never fronted Fleetwood Mac, preferring to align herself with ‘the boys’ in the rhythm section whom she first joined 50 years ago, Christine is their most successful singer-songwriter. Her hits include ‘Over My Head’, ‘Don’t Stop’ and ‘Everywhere’.  After massive global success in both the late 1970s and mid-1980s, Christine left the band in the late 1990s, quitting California and living in semi-retirement in Kent, only to rejoin the band in 2013. In this 90-minute film, this most English of singers finally gets to take centre-stage and tell both her story and the saga of Fleetwood Mac from her point of view.","popularity":1.3514,"poster_path":"/n0g0QEGgpK6IGj19FtUZwQskg7M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fleetwood Mac's Songbird: Christine McVie","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":82241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine McVie","original_name":"Christine McVie","popularity":0.0974,"profile_path":"/icAE9tk2bMWuhQRIVHTaOBmVaaP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d875b395a469000299c9241","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John McVie","original_name":"John McVie","popularity":0.076,"profile_path":"/xRstRdSd3Lx15JWGyjeDvMOIQaK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d875b45172d7f000d48fbf6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":82242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stevie Nicks","original_name":"Stevie Nicks","popularity":0.3097,"profile_path":"/n8gLNEXq7GNO4gH4MDsvYOlwuLE.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d875b4d172d7f001f48c8b6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mick Fleetwood","original_name":"Mick Fleetwood","popularity":0.2004,"profile_path":"/1m9fHO7fFLf9qJ3Y5NH84Ph5MJv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d875b57336e01002116f92e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1144915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Campbell","original_name":"Mike Campbell","popularity":0.1602,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"638d14dbab5e340079184bd6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":11656,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nancy Wilson","original_name":"Nancy Wilson","popularity":0.3319,"profile_path":"/1CA6U8bDeTfsFI881fEGs3tIGmP.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"638d19b28d77c40083edce58","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1174225,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nerina Pallot","original_name":"Nerina Pallot","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"638d19d52dc9dc00b91fe500","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":781764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Finn","original_name":"Neil Finn","popularity":0.195,"profile_path":"/v6Ze04cxN5Tie16gmaQX4jFQdSY.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"638d19f9b09bde0082a92384","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1091409,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt O'Casey","original_name":"Matt O'Casey","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d875d875a469000299c9695","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":202417,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Cooper","original_name":"Mark Cooper","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/l5xmotx7X1JVUQgwmgU60pnIOPB.jpg","credit_id":"5d875daeb76cbb000ee13217","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10995916","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n0g0QEGgpK6IGj19FtUZwQskg7M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
