It is also a journey into the heart of God.  For through the wonders of outer space we catch extraordinary glimpses of the Lord’s artistry, power, wisdom and compassion as the heavens pour out evidence of his existence every moment of every day.  This fascinating film begins with a voyage from Earth to the edge of the observable universe, 45 billion light years away.  Then, in a series of visually stunning episodes, we consider the origin and structure of the cosmos and our significance within it…the mysteries of solar eclipses and auroras…an agnostic astronomer’s honest recognition of a supernatural designer…and the convergent revelations of nature and Scripture.  The Call of the Cosmos is a celebration of science and the character of God—a remarkable film with an unforgettable message that will touch your mind and heart.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ic3xgDgpifJMf3VHmjFHcCyyRdY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40297,"logo_path":null,"name":"Illustra Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What the Universe Reveals About God","title":"The Call of the Cosmos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":568827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lad Allen","original_name":"Lad Allen","popularity":0.1196,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683e1681e68027323b28929d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1085479,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jerry Harned","original_name":"Jerry Harned","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683e16988f5e10eb267bafce","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1741556,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"W.
