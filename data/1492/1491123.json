Nervously fumbling through his lunchtime meeting with the intimidating Ms. Goodwin, he finds himself excruciatingly out of place, from his soggy sandwich to his lack of credentials.  Just as he’s about to be dismissed, a heartfelt plea about his daughter catches her attention. But instead of an opportunity, Lewis is faced with a chilling ultimatum – one that could secure his daughter’s future, but at an unimaginable cost.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Palate Cleanser","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4102784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tori Lane Ross","original_name":"Tori Lane Ross","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Goodwin","credit_id":"683c8c20c140cf05adf2b31b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3223015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cain Graham","original_name":"Cain Graham","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Lewis","credit_id":"683c8c4754205137237ba824","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3962677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa R.
