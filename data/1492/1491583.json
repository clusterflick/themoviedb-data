It narrates the story of public servants who, over time, start believing themselves to be masters rather than servants of the people whose taxes pay for their positions.  The story follows a young RTI activist, Arjun, who sets out not for revenge but to reform a decaying system that wronged his family. Through protests, legal battles, and public awareness drives, Arjun challenges those government employees who misuse their power and neglect their duties.","popularity":0.0857,"poster_path":"/szUwCHHcyTptCkbgjkNth5Ozl5I.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":227019,"logo_path":"/xa4gPgfcm6leSZQLrNUwAmyVsFN.png","name":"Solo Knacks Cineverse","origin_country":"IN"},{"id":227020,"logo_path":"/i0g8uQdXLO7192HMctlOK05m3yF.png","name":"Studio Feedfront","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"},{"english_name":"Punjabi","iso_639_1":"pa","name":"ਪੰਜਾਬੀ"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"Virus of Misconception","title":"Mental Rust","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"ਮੈਂਟਲ ਰਸਟ","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4671895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarwan Hans","original_name":"Sarwan Hans","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/5Yzc4ZDJFlFJfUpcpi6yt9jU2jr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Janardan","credit_id":"683e67f11db03c402c7f480c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4671925,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harsh Gogi","original_name":"Harsh Gogi","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/y8zvwsbRPO8mEBnB4BUdHqhOqMP.jpg","credit_id":"683dd13c07918d754cfdb506","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4935798,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"HK Mehra","original_name":"HK Mehra","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683dd1727139528434ad812a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":1278,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/szUwCHHcyTptCkbgjkNth5Ozl5I.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":862}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":220993,"name":"social awareness"},{"id":252154,"name":"public servant"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
