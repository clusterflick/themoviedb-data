Much of Mayan history has been lost to time, but modern archaeologists deciphering Mayan hieroglyphics are piecing together the splendid and tragic story of these ingenious people. This program traces the history of Mayan civilization from its roots in Central America, to its glory days in Palenque, to its pointless destruction by Spanish missionaries in their quest to promote Christianity. Archaeologists working at Mayan ruins discuss their discoveries concerning the structure of Mayan society and provide enlightening insights into many of its rituals and customs. Interviews with modern Mayans are interwoven throughout the pro-gram. They reveal the many ancient practices and customs still in practice today.
