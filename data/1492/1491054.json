When they have regaled themselves they order a Hungarian orchestra to come and play for them so that they may continue the joys of the dance. Unfortunately, one of the men conceives the idea of speaking to the serving woman at the counter. In his excitement, he seizes the counter and shoves it over, sending to the floor everything on it, including the glasses, plates, cups and saucers. They all fall and break with a terrific noise. The police, summoned by the proprietor, arrest the ringleaders and carry them off to the police station. During the hearing of their complaints, the two prisoners escape, one by the window, the other through the door. The police dart into the street during a snowstorm in pursuit.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":45867,"logo_path":null,"name":"Star Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1908-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Lost Film","title":"A Night With Masqueraders in Paris","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Méliès","original_name":"Georges Méliès","popularity":1.3609,"profile_path":"/acx5saf22Qj6FV5WAsacRHlZAMn.jpg","credit_id":"683c62dda068de6a32d216d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0227152","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1908-02-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
