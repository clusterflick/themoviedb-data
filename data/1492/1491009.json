Seizing the throne in AD 1587, he went on to transform the social, economic and religious landscape of the country. Produced to accompany the third in a series of exhibitions on great rulers, this film - presented by Neil MacGregor, Director of the British Museum - visits Iran and its capital Isfahan, created by Shah 'Abbas and still one of the most beautiful cities in the world today. There, Shah 'Abbas gathered around him a Renaissance-like court of outstanding thinkers, artists and craftsmen. During his 42-year reign, art and architecture flourished; trade networks were expanded; peace, prosperity and religious tolerance were established. And the legacy of Shah 'Abbas still lives on in modern Iran.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/pLNvBmCHNvkPLINnSmpNpH3VBTF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shah 'Abbas: The Remaking of Iran","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1419,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pLNvBmCHNvkPLINnSmpNpH3VBTF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":998}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
