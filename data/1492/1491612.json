Numerous people—historians, musicians, journalists, children of the desaparecidos (the disappeared) and others—talk candidly about how difficult it has been to uncover information about the whereabouts of the 30,000 missing men and women who were kidnapped and presumed murdered by the military. The intensely personal stories about missing relatives and the scope of the military junta's repressive policies also explain why, even now, many people resist coming to terms with Argentina's bloody past.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/v4gAVh2n1f2A1hjZxrAkCZzG3Vq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":264059,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crears
