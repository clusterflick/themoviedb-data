But José has an escape -- baseball!  He idolizes professional baseball players and dreams of the day when he can join their ranks.  If only he were playing pro ball instead of little league, he wouldn't have to put up with players like Wilbur.  Wilbur is hopeless.  He can't catch.  He can't bat.  He can't throw.  Frankly, he can't do anything but lose the game, and José is disgusted.  But, he is also envious Wilbur's mother shows up for every game, while his own mom is always a no=show.  So, José is primed and ready when his friend, Carl, suggests playing a mean trick on the unsuspecting Wilbur.  But Wilbur's reaction surprises everyone!","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":264003,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dahl-Films","origin_country":""},{"id":168764,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gospel Films Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Out!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5477475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Rich","original_name":"Jonathan Rich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"José","credit_id":"683cef3cc12a13c466d216e0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5477476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David E.
