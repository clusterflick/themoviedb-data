It gets used and abused, slowly developing a fascination and envy with the world of human people sitting by it. It watches two friends bond, a young couple have an intense breakup, and a man emotionally outburst after a phone call. The table, desperate to join the world of human friendship and melodrama, sings about its dreams. Then suddenly, it bursts out of its own body, a human form out of its destroyed table-self. The table is set to re-encounter all the people it'd watched before. It tries to join the two friends eating at another table, attempts to console the woman over her recent breakup, and tries to learn about happiness, life, and death from the phone guy. It'll have to decide whether or not being a human person is worth it after all.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/fm6s7ZBoqpi2xMBQ2mB2oD2PvPH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
