The images are Adolf Eichmann, at his trial in Jerusalem in 1961. I used a Cine-Kodak Eight Model 60 with the shutter and claw removed, placed on a Cine-Kodak Titler, to rephotograph the images from a cheap, miniature television, creating a vertically smeared, pulsating image. Then I projected the regular 8mm film at 5 fps on a Bolex Paillard 18-5 and rephotographed it on Super-8. The process was intended to evoke the blurred quality of Gerhard Richter’s “October 18, 1977,” a cycle of photopaintings of the Red Army Faction, or Baader-Meinhof Gang.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"TV Assassin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315085,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian L.
