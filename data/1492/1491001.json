From his awe-inspiring capital Tenochtitlan (the site of modern-day Mexico City), this semi-divine figure presided over a vast a politically complex empire extending from the Gulf Coast to the Pacific Ocean. All this was to come to a dramatic end in 1519, when Moctezuma and the Mexica came fact to face with another aggressive, expansionist society - the Spanish, led by Hernán Cortés.
