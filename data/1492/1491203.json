With independent stages already on the endangered species list, fans faced the heightened threat of losing these coveted sanctuaries for live music and the cultural support system they create.  The film features dozens of Milestone alumni, including the Violent Femmes, who reflect on the many shows they played at the club during the 80s and the troubling trend of historic venues like the Milestone shutting down.  The threat to the Milestone seems even more ominous as other independent venues in Charlotte fall like dominoes, many closing their doors over the past decade. Between the live music industryâ€™s expansive corporate takeover and coronavirus closures, how will the Milestone survive and stay true to its heritage in a world where $5 rock shows are quickly becoming a thing of the past?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/164OSq1OJgy15umgj4krDTjiRXo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"On this stage, some of the greatest bands got their start.
