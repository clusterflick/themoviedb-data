From the years of the Resistance to those in which he was mayor of Amelia, a small Umbrian village. From the years alongside the \" 'his teacher Di Vittorio \"' to the secretariat of the CGIL, through the stories of those who have been close to him, we arrive at the fifties and sixties who see Lama first at the head of the chemists and then of the metalworkers.  But it is the seventies and eighties the real protagonists, years in which Lama is at the head of the largest Italian trade union organization: he becomes secretary in the moments of maximum brilliance of the union and is forced to face one battle after another: the agreement on the single point of contingency, the oil crisis, the turning point of the Eur, the fight against terrorism, the referendum on the escalator.","popularity":0.1937,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":251568,"logo_path":null,"name":"ASSOCIAZIONE CENTENARIO CGIL","origin_country":""},{"id":251569,"logo_path":null,"name":"FONDAZIONE DI VITTORIO","origin_country":""},{"id":251570,"logo_path":null,"name":"KOMEDÃŒ PRODUZIONI","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un leader in ascolto","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1398447,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Erika Manoni","original_name":"Erika Manoni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6797b7969ca029099c2b1923","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3879086,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pietro Medioli","original_name":"Pietro Medioli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6797b7aa25d2980fb02424f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3879086,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pietro Medioli","original_name":"Pietro Medioli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6797b7b225d2980fb02424f5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3040984,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marco Tani","original_name":"Marco Tani","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6797b7c10a30d6d059242081","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5207232,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Modest P.
