Noriah and Arian, a former couple, come back together for the first time on the night before Noriah's wedding. The film is a look back at young love - from the perspective of adulthood. When you're in it, it surely must be forever. But, of course, it cannot sustain itself in the face of such inexperience. The film is an admission of a universal truth, that the one who got away will never truly leave us.","popularity":0.3176,"poster_path":"/e2kE8pZ49JeGz78QZfFkpJjSJNJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3161254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Layla Mohammadi","original_name":"Layla Mohammadi","popularity":0.0981,"profile_path":"/pjKw06MAlEwaF5lIAMh7XpoEFqk.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Noriah","credit_id":"667cea6d16f633cc52194a12","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1538441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rahart Adams","original_name":"Rahart Adams","popularity":0.2796,"profile_path":"/dpSuyFEKehh53tCg6hlUpLKnGe3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Arian","credit_id":"667cea861c023b09d56ec206","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":165263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Azizi","original_name":"Anthony Azizi","popularity":0.562,"profile_path":"/99kIeqvCOvdPhyvogbpV9iYglAE.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ramin","credit_id":"667ceab19beb6d8b1a351016","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4797137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharareh Shahbazi","original_name":"Sharareh Shahbazi","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Isabel","credit_id":"667ceadcdb9b36dace194b7e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4797138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophia Sadri","original_name":"Sophia Sadri","popularity":0.0882,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Young Noriah","credit_id":"667ceaff604685b69d35101a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4797139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arta Rajabi","original_name":"Arta Rajabi","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Young Arian","credit_id":"667ceb12e3f52ebf9662e084","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4797141,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Martin Lasa","original_name":"Martin Lasa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667cec7131949b8e67591d30","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1393236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alain Ali Washnevsky","original_name":"Alain Ali Washnevsky","popularity":0.2664,"profile_path":"/fr1UfJ9IftJBXamdr4hqRFQmZHM.jpg","credit_id":"667cecb7eec7439d0cb9a57e","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4797140,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sam Scott","original_name":"Sam Scott","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667cec1aeec7439d0cb9a56d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1393236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alain Ali Washnevsky","original_name":"Alain Ali Washnevsky","popularity":0.2664,"profile_path":"/fr1UfJ9IftJBXamdr4hqRFQmZHM.jpg","credit_id":"667ceb73741328b81bb9a898","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4797140,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sam Scott","original_name":"Sam Scott","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667cec34fb39b85a148cfba4","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4797142,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anthony Ushino","original_name":"Anthony Ushino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667cec8b8690e1eede5add1a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1393236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alain Ali Washnevsky","original_name":"Alain Ali Washnevsky","popularity":0.2664,"profile_path":"/fr1UfJ9IftJBXamdr4hqRFQmZHM.jpg","credit_id":"667cec44eda322fdb91941a7","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4797142,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anthony Ushino","original_name":"Anthony Ushino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667ceca179351e86ce9bd7cf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1655819,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Senda Bonnet","original_name":"Senda Bonnet","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667ced2231949b8e67591d5f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16436054","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1415,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/e2kE8pZ49JeGz78QZfFkpJjSJNJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
