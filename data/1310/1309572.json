Now visibly tortured and completely apathetic, she longs for death, convinced she won’t leave this place alive. Despite her despair, Andrea finds herself in an unwilling struggle against her tormentor, Philip, who thrives on eliciting her intense reactions through physical and psychological torture. Her only defense is to remain utterly unresponsive, denying him the pleasure he seeks from her pain.
