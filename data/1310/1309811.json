Let's connect through dance. The song is sung by Thelma Aoyama, who became popular with the Docomo commercial \"Soba Iru Ne\". From there, the era progressed further with smartphones and VR, and finally to the present. All the people who have appeared so far will take to the stage and deliver the 30-year history of Moshi Moshi through song and dance, conveying Docomo's commitment to connecting people with energy.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/cQlcFjO6rxmlhVQyeSs15gY2KvY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":184123,"logo_path":null,"name":"Headlight","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2024-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moshimoshi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4798376,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takumi Shiga","original_name":"Takumi Shiga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667dc5a0db6675c32b8d565e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cQlcFjO6rxmlhVQyeSs15gY2KvY.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
