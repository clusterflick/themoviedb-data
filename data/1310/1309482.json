The work portraits a monument significant for Valparaíso and for Chilean history: the memorial monument of the Detained and Disappeared.  It is a sculpture consisting of a curved row of upright standing flat iron plates of different heights.  Similar to listening with a stethoscope or measuring the temperature of a human body, Kirkegaard used sensors (accelerometers) placed on the surfaces of the different iron plates. Determined by their respective heights, and evoked by the surrounding wind, traffic, voices or manifestations, the unique resonant tones of the memorial were revealed.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/bZnG7LRbPxDdnEKhr5sW40bnEjh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Disappeared","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1326761,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacob Kirkegaard","original_name":"Jacob Kirkegaard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667c99997562cf5e10fdf774","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bZnG7LRbPxDdnEKhr5sW40bnEjh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
