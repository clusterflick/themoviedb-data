Terrorised by the possibility of being turned into Chop Suey, the dog passes a frightening night, running through the restaurant and hearing the telenovela-like conversations taking place at the different tables. With the camera placed in the dog’s perspective, this short film acts as an amusing panorama of Lisbon society at the end of the 20th century.","popularity":0.3463,"poster_path":"/wUgyMPVVsQ0xFOEfMSYViZ2NR6l.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Dragons","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":591220,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Zanatti","original_name":"Ana Zanatti","popularity":0.1874,"profile_path":"/9sRanf61hqCthRSm3rpYNXDUHC3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"667d1528264d5a33a6b9ac8a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":71283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beatriz Batarda","original_name":"Beatriz Batarda","popularity":0.2756,"profile_path":"/gDlPG1CivHUuSpFI9rSy3p33Ogo.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Luisa","credit_id":"667d153a4cede2f2fb8cf89d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Pedro Gomes","original_name":"José Pedro Gomes","popularity":0.1969,"profile_path":"/nn3M3nwls84m30N91BInFk4r8XZ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dog (voice)","credit_id":"667d1561032655aba1794140","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":108454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Bustorff","original_name":"Ana Bustorff","popularity":0.4465,"profile_path":"/8DCRwf1qBHjmXxEnWHwxWV3wIyA.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Child's Mother","credit_id":"667f245acf64f3dc808a8e7a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"João Lagarto","original_name":"João Lagarto","popularity":0.1903,"profile_path":"/8oXTZ1Z5uivuNcMlOWTgHgzoRaG.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Child's Father","credit_id":"667f24701930197b7d67c0e6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":108456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cristina Carvalhal","original_name":"Cristina Carvalhal","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":"/rgDgeSHS5Dcj1E2BySkeucJ5imm.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"1st Friend","credit_id":"667f258763fc423d11e8027b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":937224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margarida Marinho","original_name":"Margarida Marinho","popularity":0.2689,"profile_path":"/zHhdtFBNPar29R3qGnnx9z0oNoQ.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"2nd Friend","credit_id":"667f25ac9ace04687152510f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4800075,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fernán García de Zúñiga","original_name":"Fernán García de Zúñiga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Child","credit_id":"667f25db7d768ff253ba84e4","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1076366,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margarida Cardoso","original_name":"Margarida Cardoso","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":"/xFaD7SCj4FTzbeNPHQ9nWesIzUt.jpg","credit_id":"667d14e2f167b94f576ec2fc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1540816,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ana Luísa Guimarães","original_name":"Ana Luísa Guimarães","popularity":0.0437,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667f2503f05560975f46d560","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1917304,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Orlando Alegria","original_name":"Orlando Alegria","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667f24b8b731dda7cce802b3","department":"Camera","job":"First Assistant \"A\" Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1322518,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rosi Burguete","original_name":"Rosi Burguete","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667f2487bd2af57d2dfeda62","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2097473,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Carlos Assis","original_name":"Carlos Assis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667f24f2afc32b7bcddeaac5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0116122","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1034,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wUgyMPVVsQ0xFOEfMSYViZ2NR6l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":734}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
