His place of residence is the cockpit of an Il-76 airplane lying in the VTORCHERMET landfill in an industrial suburb. The main place in his home is occupied by a computer. GG sits there day and night, playing computer games. Checking his personal card for funds, Ivan realizes that he is no longer entitled to social benefits, but instead receives a “notification” that persons over 25 years of age who do not benefit society are subject to mandatory euthanasia. After 72 hours, the GG must appear at the “social regulation” point to undergo the disposal procedure. Ivan calls his friend to discuss the situation and find understanding in his eyes, but the conversation takes a different turn.","popularity":0.07,"poster_path":"/yhQvCeqpOJJ7ggMasfaJQrbAy8j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2024-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Мусор","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Musor","type":"Transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3999905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikita Voronov","original_name":"Микита Воронов","popularity":0.0939,"profile_path":"/o4hEgUaVU09iWk6hxeimnsxTaCH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"667c8d5456580dc216e03dc9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4796775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikita Chernigovsky","original_name":"Nikita Chernigovsky","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"667c8d5f258abc6b9f16cf1c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4796776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irina Velikaya","original_name":"Irina Velikaya","popularity":0.0554,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"667c8d77580bce2833e03dd7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2691209,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lyudmila Shubina","original_name":"Lyudmila Shubina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"667c8d8ce5bd0b8f8d39b56c","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4796777,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexey Mityagin","original_name":"Alexey Mityagin","popularity":0.1158,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667c8da65ecbb9ade3557f78","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4796777,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexey Mityagin","original_name":"Alexey Mityagin","popularity":0.1158,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667c8db201eacf1162f9bf2a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4796777,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexey Mityagin","original_name":"Alexey Mityagin","popularity":0.1158,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66960fc1d62385765a78006b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4832178,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Evgeny Bely","original_name":"Evgeny Bely","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66960f4abc93142c65a38b16","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4832189,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anna Vavilova","original_name":"Anna Vavilova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66960fac89773f4ad25dcf99","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4832187,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Azalia Minnullina","original_name":"Azalia Minnullina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66960f8a21c92492c1f3af6b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4796777,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexey Mityagin","original_name":"Alexey Mityagin","popularity":0.1158,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66960f794777a7bc3804de23","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4832182,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alexander Nechaev","original_name":"Alexander Nechaev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66960f649b21878805f3af03","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/yhQvCeqpOJJ7ggMasfaJQrbAy8j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Gorky New Russian Cinema Film Festival","release_date":"2024-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
