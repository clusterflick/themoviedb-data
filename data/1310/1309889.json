After a short stay in prison, Tony tries to get his life back together and make amends with his estranged wife and young daughter. He makes a routine stop at a local gas station that will forever change his life. Inside the gas station four college students are shooting a film project. They have decided to film a mock robbery. They call \"action\" as Tony sees what is happening inside. Tony reaches into his glove box, grabs his gun and leaps into action. Believing he is the hero, he rushes inside and shoots the \"robber.\" Tony quickly realizes he is not the hero of this story, but now a murderer of an innocent young man.
