The premiere took place in 1962 in the rebuilt Coventry Cathedral, whose previous building had been destroyed by German bombing. The text was based on the Latin text of the Missa pro Defunctis and poems by Wilfred Owen, one of the most important literary witnesses to the horrors of the First World War.","popularity":0.1592,"poster_path":"/zGDMMH0N7v5eljW6GXCqdbbfGS9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2024-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Britten: War Requiem","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46873,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Benjamin Britten","original_name":"Benjamin Britten","popularity":0.1166,"profile_path":"/wChG0vkLBF1JdA2divUULyDIzAH.jpg","credit_id":"667e9b437faf47fd93a2430a","department":"Writing","job":"Opera"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1654586,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Teodor Currentzis","original_name":"Teodor Currentzis","popularity":0.3114,"profile_path":"/tUfr78hs4jdKmaM0m6zrTyJKT2O.jpg","credit_id":"667e9b61b283307dcba24358","department":"Sound","job":"Orchestrator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2791243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"SWR Symphonieorchester","original_name":"SWR Symphonieorchester","popularity":0.0769,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667e9bc6a813fd667b7ddf26","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zGDMMH0N7v5eljW6GXCqdbbfGS9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
