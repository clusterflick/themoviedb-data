Staged and filmed in Italy's largest theatre, the Teatro Massimo in Palermo, Sicily, this production captures remarkable performances by the Italian soprano Anna Pirozzi as Lady Macbeth, the renowned Verdi specialist, baritone Roberto Frontali, in one of his signature roles, and the rising star, Croatian bass-baritone Marko Mimica as Banco (Banquo). The conductor, Gabriele Ferro, has opted to use the 1865 Paris version of the score, sung in Italian and without the ballets, for a production that received generous praise in Palermo and on tour.","popularity":0.2064,"poster_path":"/zuiEcpM94oATDBdMpvMp2cspqJf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174269,"logo_path":null,"name":"Teatro Massimo","origin_country":""},{"id":77605,"logo_path":null,"name":"NAXOS","origin_country":""},{"id":232396,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dynamic","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2018-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":156,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Giuseppe Verdi: Macbeth","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1017356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto Frontali","original_name":"Roberto Frontali","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Macbeth","credit_id":"667e780b16f41d3b5cdcf76a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3301032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marko Mimica","original_name":"Marko Mimica","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Banco / Apparizioni","credit_id":"667e781bcb850d5f3433fd4d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2449932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Pirozzi","original_name":"Anna Pirozzi","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/bjA9sDPmsYxVKHDnFJfLp323EPa.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lady Macbeth","credit_id":"667e783c5a9df7105fd7afc1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3363838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincenzo Costanzo","original_name":"Vincenzo Costanzo","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Macduff","credit_id":"667e7864403e510fa38d748c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2612076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuel Pierattelli","original_name":"Manuel Pierattelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Malcolm","credit_id":"667e787a7a3494859ac4ca16","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2150743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"NICOLO CERIANI","original_name":"NICOLO CERIANI","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Medico","credit_id":"667e788afefc1b2136a24293","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1203455,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emma Dante","original_name":"Emma Dante","popularity":0.0801,"profile_path":"/u73xor0aSIzTIrZjZ80Lt1Fjc7s.jpg","credit_id":"667e78e2dfe93b2384da9bbc","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1339067,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gabriele Ferro","original_name":"Gabriele Ferro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667e78d2592d620536d7b062","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3843247,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Cristian Zucaro","original_name":"Cristian Zucaro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667e79211ffc9e4f138d765f","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1322755,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuela Lo Sicco","original_name":"Manuela Lo Sicco","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667e797b5bc74ebb40da9baa","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2738761,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Vanessa Sannino","original_name":"Vanessa Sannino","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667e796d71be70aad533fd5b","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1203480,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmine Maringola","original_name":"Carmine Maringola","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667e795d16f41d3b5cdcf781","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zuiEcpM94oATDBdMpvMp2cspqJf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1063}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"[2.110578 / NBD0077V] Giuseppe Verdi â€“ Macbeth","key":"7XfEh7mCgxs","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-07-27T08:03:08.000Z","id":"667e7c0571be70aad533fd6d"}]}}}
