Whilst Anna and Rosa try to impress the judges making by perfect and beautiful carpets, Maria surprises the village by creating an unexpected textile.  Designer, illustrator, and animator Carolina Melis' short film Le fiamme di Nule uses animation and live footage to portray the story of the three weavers in the Sardinian village of Nule. The story was inspired by a trip Meils took to the village, where she became fascinated with their traditional textile-making
