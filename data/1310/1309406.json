They’ve always dreamed of having children, but their efforts were only met with failures. After having adopted Mapring, a 4-year-old boy from Thailand, their life takes a tragic turn when Mathilda dies in an accident. Thomas then finds himself alone with a child he hadn’t really wanted. Devastated by this loss and incapable of forming a bond with Mapring, he decides to go look for the child’s biological family. Accompanied by Chaan, a local guide, Thomas starts on a trying journey through Thailand. Over time, father and son start to tame each other and create bonds… However, a crucial question remains: what will Thomas do when he finds Mapring’s biological
