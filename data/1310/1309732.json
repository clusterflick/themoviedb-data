They are young, successful and well-set parts in today's social-political establishment. When their children disappear in a storm, the entire construct of their friendship starts to crumble. Very soon, their bourgeoisie façade falls and the four turn into the profile of a lost culture. What  follows  is  an odyssey  through  the  forests  that turns more and more into a journey into the metaphysical. The story is told in fragments and out of chronological order. The forest and the film imagery act as a poetic expression of the inner mind, creating the metaphorical psychogram of a lost cul-ture that desperately looking for a way out and a future. It is a poetic portrait of today's society.","popularity":0.0575,"poster_path":"/p26rEm9vAVWGQfdbcgEsGirT8i0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93626,"logo_path":null,"name":"Utopia-Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":138,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Forest","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1184774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Fritz","original_name":"Daniel Fritz","popularity":0.1493,"profile_path":"/eC19JsGnMV0whgsaT4w0CQoaIoQ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Marek","credit_id":"667d9ca828eb70787438b104","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4798072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"René Erler","original_name":"René Erler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Paul","credit_id":"667d9cb400e73efa79d5e104","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4798073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabrina Strehl","original_name":"Sabrina Strehl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Swenja","credit_id":"667d9cc09360624e9dab96a6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4798074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leni Wesselman","original_name":"Leni Wesselman","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Maria","credit_id":"667d9cd1e246bf900d13332f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4798076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lilith Bietmann","original_name":"Lilith Bietmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Sina","credit_id":"667d9ce0c59a5887a196a826","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4798077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noam Bietmann","original_name":"Noam Bietmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Phillip","credit_id":"667d9ceca5e6ff5ee618b97d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4798078,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klaus Bräuer","original_name":"Klaus Bräuer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Manager","credit_id":"667d9d008851cfa366552fc6","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4798065,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Viktor Gasic","original_name":"Viktor Gasic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667d9b9917d9bac79396a7f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4798066,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Stefanie Boike","original_name":"Stefanie Boike","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667d9bb0ab05b9a751d5e0e6","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4798067,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Minkyu Kim","original_name":"Minkyu Kim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667d9bd2c1f0f77b16552f9d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4798065,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Viktor Gasic","original_name":"Viktor Gasic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667d9c4e0fc9826d1825170c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4798068,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Art Vigo","original_name":"Art Vigo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667d9c0b2bd8fbc09b19367e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3559274","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":858,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9HLgdFMTTlAhF8bR9TouPE6JwdG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1526}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/p26rEm9vAVWGQfdbcgEsGirT8i0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":673}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
