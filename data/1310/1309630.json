A good quarter of Russian pre-revolutionary film industry consisted of pictures like this. A circus drama was almost a sub-genre of its own. What distinguishes this film is the involvement of actual circus performers, some of the biggest names in the industry, many of them having never made another film. One could only wish that all of them would perform their signature acts, like Sergei Alperov and his son Dmitry Alperov, the legendary acrobats. Instead, Williams Truzzi, arguably the most famous Russian circus jockey of his time, plays the villain, Tamara Gamsakurdia, a horseback dancer, appears as his innocent victim, and Nikolai Nikitin, who would soon become the owner and director of the Moscow circus, becomes the noble hero.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4b9hg6HMFMZFE37Bx4mRLhra6Qi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1916-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daniel' Rok","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2731823,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikhail Bonch-Tomashevsky","original_name":"Mikhail Bonch-Tomashevsky","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/lPXT5vIA5u1ybcrNGaNFfiCvGZw.jpg","credit_id":"672906a82e1b7978dbb3a29e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2475,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/4b9hg6HMFMZFE37Bx4mRLhra6Qi.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1650},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/gxXbPB1TGOUklLKFpWDqweHFMr7.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"1916-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
