The visualizations are produced through point cloud data using 3D scanning techniques to portray and preserve private and public recollections. The videos invite the viewer to “walk inside” these moments, creating an immersive experience of a fading past. The piece explores the alienation that arises from the changing socio-political climate of Turkey as Istanbul becomes more of an idea than a place. Recollections of safe and cherished times with family remain as the only uninterrupted memories in the changing nature of the city.","popularity":0.0559,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memory Place","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4798111,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zeynep Abes","original_name":"Zeynep Abes","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667da33f9912e748d951d951","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
