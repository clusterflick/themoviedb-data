Neither wind, nor mist, nor even snow will stop his stride as he makes his way to his hideout, his lookout: a fir tree. As he slips beneath its low-hanging branches, the man disappears—and a world awakens: the world of animals. The old wise man invites us to share in the powerful emotions he has felt during thousands of such vigils. Now, the time has come for him to open up his knowledge and share the memories of his most beautiful wild encounters. Through a journey in the forests close to home, he will awaken in us a sensitivity—more precisely, the poetry of the wild world—one he began passing on to his son at the age of twelve, and perhaps one day to his grandson.","popularity":0.0443,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":11010,"logo_path":"/lYQDiCx6qUJbatstiq51JHl6hbg.png","name":"Paprika Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":232270,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kobalann","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":591,"logo_path":"/q5I5RDwMEiqoNmfaJgd2LraEOJY.png","name":"France 3 Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2025-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Le chant des forêts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Whispering in the Woods","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2294474,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent Munier","original_name":"Vincent Munier","popularity":0.1442,"profile_path":"/u8lxdHBWxwClQ9FnlOSASd1E1L9.jpg","credit_id":"667c5ebcaf365c31b939b446","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2294474,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent Munier","original_name":"Vincent Munier","popularity":0.1442,"profile_path":"/u8lxdHBWxwClQ9FnlOSASd1E1L9.jpg","credit_id":"667c5ec3af365c31b939b449","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32368068","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
