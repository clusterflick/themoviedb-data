[...] But it was not only politics and the lives of many people that changed with the world, but also the way we think. And more permanently than one might think. For a long time after that evening, there were calls for a major, analytical reappraisal of what had happened. After all the talk about bananas, the German feature pages hoped for \"the great German novel of the turnaround\". The fact that this has not appeared in the last 30 years has to do with the fact that thinking and art have changed forever along with the world.
