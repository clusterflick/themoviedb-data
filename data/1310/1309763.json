Working as a journalist, she stays out for long hours, resulting in negligence of her children and her husband’s suspicions of infidelity. The twist, at once ironic and realistic, is that her unsupportive husband had actually written in his youth a book on gender equality. On the verge of divorce, the couple reconciles after the husband’s mother, sympathetic to the difficulties faced by women, rises to the occasion with timely and prudent advice.\r Hung’s character, a woman stuck between cultures of old and new, was tailor-made for the star by screenwriter Chu Hak. Director Li Pingqian portrays her struggles with realist and humanistic touches, extending gentle critiques of social prejudices without fanning the ire of resentment.","popularity":0.2184,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":65520,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Great Wall Movie Enterprises Ltd.","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1955-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It So Happens to a Woman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1346970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hung Sin-Nui","original_name":"Hung Sin-Nui","popularity":0.0372,"profile_path":"/dGcH8gIJHrhpN1sTL06JjRMulbM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"667daa6f442728ade5ab976f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":565475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ping Fan","original_name":"平凡","popularity":0.111,"profile_path":"/eThwVuz2INdwcJd2l3X8bxLnTat.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"667daa7e2bf616b75f173bdf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":82177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josephine Siao Fong-Fong","original_name":"Josephine Siao Fong-Fong","popularity":0.3757,"profile_path":"/aO8CRYiKw8UwoW27okaEjUmghT9.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"667dab15ba77bd3b4525177f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2236453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fu Chi","original_name":"Fu Chi","popularity":0.1463,"profile_path":"/ceJSY2cpy8P0ZmPD58IBj0VjM87.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"667dab6bc59a5887a196a8b2","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1753109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Li Ping-Qian","original_name":"Li Ping-Qian","popularity":0.0856,"profile_path":"/4UZbNOmLzyjEHB8wjsScXsGGDld.jpg","credit_id":"667daaa7c59a5887a196a8a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1955-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
