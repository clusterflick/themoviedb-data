One day she chances upon an old, open game of XO (tic tac toe) in a forgotten corner. Curious, she scribbles a move which is reciprocated the next day and thus a game ensues.  Over days, each game ends in a draw. And Rumi is always greeted with a new game with the first move. As poetic romanticism plays out in her own life, Rumi falls in love with the idea of this playfully mysterious person. Their playful relationship continues until Rumi is given a chance to win and she takes it, going one up.  The games stop thereafter - there is no new XO. Rumi does not understand why and is disappointed, worried, and eventually heartbroken. Finally, she realizes something that changes her life and helps her come out of her shell.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/mJoa3e5JpmrtEb6SRzlL6mPHEi5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"XO","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4462221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kamakshi Bhat","original_name":"Kamakshi Bhat","popularity":0.0411,"profile_path":"/7pJtDck3c5rPtIvGkaJ2RUCfhCi.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"667c52df86619eb1b075996f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4796247,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samrat Das Gupta","original_name":"Samrat Das Gupta","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667c52d63d702e52c5557cce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1434678,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ranjan Palit","original_name":"Ranjan Palit","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/hGG6diFYa6mPYVq69PhtIAuPxBc.jpg","credit_id":"667c532f991068ed4639b434","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":979,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mJoa3e5JpmrtEb6SRzlL6mPHEi5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":653}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New York Indian Film Festival","release_date":"2024-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
