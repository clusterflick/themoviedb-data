The author believes that man began killing systematically 30,000 years ago when the Cro-Magnon Man killed off the Neanderthal Man because the latter was different. Man has been killing ever since. This very rare and most unusual docudrama with a cast made up entirely of men in ape suits is based on the work of the impossibly pompous anthropologist/ screenwriter Robert Ardrey, who attempts to unpack the origins and evolution of the killer instinct.","popularity":0.605,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1975-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Up From The Ape","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Animal Within","type":"alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Primal Man","type":"alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Zerbe","original_name":"Anthony Zerbe","popularity":0.724,"profile_path":"/ctp83m2ntqbz69jOU8W5aU4sBtI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"676ad01e9d07c335fe7eb9de","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2312192,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Paula Crist","original_name":"Paula Crist","popularity":0.1151,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Earthling Throwback","credit_id":"676ad02ffdaa7c2549a9edf3","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7765,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Walon Green","original_name":"Walon Green","popularity":0.3348,"profile_path":"/73kzAYsaB7QjVr7ZecVmaTswZIr.jpg","credit_id":"676ad04245cc55ffb764c028","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":50759,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert Ardrey","original_name":"Robert Ardrey","popularity":0.1825,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676ad04fb0c376d421aa057f","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":50759,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert Ardrey","original_name":"Robert Ardrey","popularity":0.1825,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676ad0559d07c335fe7eb9e2","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9217,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lalo Schifrin","original_name":"Lalo Schifrin","popularity":0.2087,"profile_path":"/z0oiAAkTufe6TJPtI7IeUd5fPuj.jpg","credit_id":"676ad06145cc55ffb764c039","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0072350","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1975-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
