Among the resurrected is Heather, the sister of police officer David Thompson. David, along with his journalist wife Fiona, are drawn into the heart of this global enigma. They enlist the help of scientists Bryan Carter and Samantha Willis, who specialize in cellular regeneration and necrology, to unravel the mystery. The team discovers unsettling patterns and hidden truths about the resurrected individuals, who are exhibiting strange behaviors and slowly transforming into something otherworldly. Fiona's investigation leads her to a Satanist organization that may be behind the mass disappearance and resurrection. The stakes escalate as they realize the resurrections are not miraculous, but sinister, and a race against time begins to prevent a catastrophic event that threatens to unleash a nightmarish force upon the world.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/g7RITPWtS7u7EFc8ebW7sbfljDR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":217167,"logo_path":null,"name":"CreepTV Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":232350,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rynh-Joon Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":232351,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gaard Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FortySix","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4456327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aylin Baykal","original_name":"Aylin Baykal","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/uBwZUEplsdrUsaJgFAV25e0cfOM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Fiona","credit_id":"667d9f51a197f0f65296a821","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4456329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Dean Castiglione","original_name":"James Dean Castiglione","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"David","credit_id":"667d9f6ab7ddc6dcf7133353","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4456325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zachary Chambers","original_name":"Zachary Chambers","popularity":0.0911,"profile_path":"/xjcly5OB0V8awGRIUQUCdv3i09G.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bryan","credit_id":"667d9f77ccdcaffc8f552fb6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4456326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evie Campbell","original_name":"Evie Campbell","popularity":0.0587,"profile_path":"/hBDQKwMRrtdTzBwONaBSuARk6F5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Samantha","credit_id":"667d9f9728eb70787438b11e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4456358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stacey Wolowitz","original_name":"Stacey Wolowitz","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/fZXotE1wQW319IZttZCZEtmkAPr.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Heather","credit_id":"667d9fa9beaa377f2418b99e","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4456309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harley Coleman","original_name":"Harley Coleman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667d9fd16456efb88c96a81e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4456142,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Victorius Kingston","original_name":"Victorius Kingston","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/f4ubhiOu3Qlzj5wHRb9OaspBPNn.jpg","credit_id":"667da01443331e95c3d5e100","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4456327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aylin Baykal","original_name":"Aylin Baykal","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/uBwZUEplsdrUsaJgFAV25e0cfOM.jpg","credit_id":"667da00261a0f3490525171a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4456310,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roe Hyung-Joon","original_name":"Roe Hyung-Joon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667d9fbf023306f59e51d944","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"creeptvproductions","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1133,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/g7RITPWtS7u7EFc8ebW7sbfljDR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-12-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
