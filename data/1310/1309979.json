People are attracted to Il Trovatore because of its rousing melodies, its brutal, powerful plot, and its simple structure: elements that make it one of the best examples of Verdi’s theatre pieces. Recorded live at the Sferisterio theatre of Macerata in the summer of 2016, under conductor Daniel Oren's vibrant and incisive direction, this production boasts a first-rate cast and elegant direction from Francisco Negrin. The sets and costumes by Louis Désiré and lighting by Bruno Poet were well received by the Sferisterio audience.","popularity":0.1946,"poster_path":"/huxiPFw9mjwTU1TFfH78A9MkUdr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72250,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sferisterio Opera Festival","origin_country":""},{"id":10310,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dynamic","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2017-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":139,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Giuseppe Verdi: Il Trovatore","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2612022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Caria","original_name":"Marco Caria","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Il Conte di Luna","credit_id":"667e7e77f8317d69d67de1bb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2449932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Pirozzi","original_name":"Anna Pirozzi","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/bjA9sDPmsYxVKHDnFJfLp323EPa.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Leonora","credit_id":"667e7e91f2b3343e55b3d419","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1572398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enkelejda Shkoza","original_name":"Enkelejda Shkoza","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Azucena","credit_id":"667e7ec918050a10ed1a10ea","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2148312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Piero Pretti","original_name":"Piero Pretti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Manrico","credit_id":"667e7eda780807f0da45f6b1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1383472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alessandro Spina","original_name":"Alessandro Spina","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Ferrando","credit_id":"667e7ee73be6b970f9b3d947","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4742690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosanna Lo Greco","original_name":"Rosanna Lo Greco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Ines","credit_id":"667e7ef4793e2859bdb3d56b","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1684767,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Désiré","original_name":"Louis Désiré","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667e7f4fdbe7ec8f42c4cd20","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1684767,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Désiré","original_name":"Louis Désiré","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667e7f5b4527776790b3d5ec","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2356851,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francisco Negrín","original_name":"Francisco Negrín","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667e7f318c404851c22a72b9","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1384609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Oren","original_name":"Daniel Oren","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/iy7Q72UxuaZ2MCSSHzojVFtuzdq.jpg","credit_id":"667e7f4014f0f3a7d8c6e0e2","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1882340,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Bruno Poet","original_name":"Bruno Poet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667e7f7241a96e5e32b3d4bf","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/huxiPFw9mjwTU1TFfH78A9MkUdr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1063}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2017-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Verdi: Il Trovatore [Macerata Opera Festival]","key":"wNj24wdD_tM","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-05-24T12:57:42.000Z","id":"667e7e414527776790b3d5e5"}]}}}
