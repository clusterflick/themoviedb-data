The first social cooperative in the world is born in Trieste. It was formed by 28 people: two sociologists, two psychologists, five nurses, a healthcare assistant, two doctors and sixteen private individuals who all have the same residential address: via San Cilino 16, Trieste. They are interned in a psychiatric hospital and therefore have no civil and political rights: they cannot vote, marry or make a will. Imagine founding a cooperative. Thus the Court of Trieste rejected the request to establish the cooperative. It would have been a long march through the institutions.","popularity":0.2248,"poster_path":"/7OSIKX1ayymbotk1PVoGTHmJdG4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":232251,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ghirigori","origin_country":""},{"id":232252,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cooperativa
