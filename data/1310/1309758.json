It focuses on the neighbourhoods of South Cambie and Fairview that lie on the unceded, traditional, ancestral territories of the Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish), Stó:lo and S.’lílw.taʔ/ Selilwitulh (Tsleil-Waututh) and xwm.θkw.y’.m (Musqueam) Nations (known by some as Vancouver, BC, Canada). Shot on 16mm colour reversal film and cut with archival found footage, the film explores the emotional friction within a neighbourhood of changing communities, shopkeepers, settlers and lives. While Hong Kong migrants in the 1980s were a major force in shaping the architectural and cultural landscape of the community, evidence of these lives are disappearing due to rapid gentrification and erasure of history. Remnants are left behind.","popularity":0.0412,"poster_path":"/ef9kQ5LFe1hA3jdbvgPAC5SujY7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ghosts of cambie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2794797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline So Jung Lee","original_name":"Caroline So Jung Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667da39ba8843c1c7218b993","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ef9kQ5LFe1hA3jdbvgPAC5SujY7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
