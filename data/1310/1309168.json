Many of these incidents could potentially be avoided with proper planning and critical thinking in the backcountry.  In partnership with Friends of Bridger-Teton, TGR presents Backcountry Responsibly, a digital film targeted at the growing number of winter backcountry users whose impact on the surrounding public lands has increased dramatically in recent years.
