The collection includes several of the group's most-enduring hits: \"Beginnings,\" \"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\" and \"Questions 67 and 68.\" The set topped the album chart (and remained on the chart for an amazing three-year run), was certified double platinum and earned the band a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist. Released on this day in 1969, CHICAGO TRANSIT AUTHORITY was only the beginning for the septet, but it has the confidence and consistency of a group bound for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Transferred from the original half-inch four-channel masters, this Blu-ray has 192/24 resolution Quadraphonic and hi-res stereo mixes.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/6Dffd9bG2uRSeVAYTtqTm94gpof.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chicago Transit Authority","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tuYu8KtK9lNMPoQ1WLgCwQDXDzR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6Dffd9bG2uRSeVAYTtqTm94gpof.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
