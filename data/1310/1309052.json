In that period the first experiences of pirate radio arose in Italy. Mimmo is thrilled by the rumors about it and wastes no time: he builds himself an FM transmitter and thus sets up Radio Perla del Tirreno, the first pirate radio station in Bagnara Calabra. The voices of the radio reflect on politics, philosophy, civic education, creating a discourse that is the portrait of a society and an era.","popularity":0.0413,"poster_path":"/9sMoQp9xbLmVPdvchE3wWQjF6OJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Radio Perla del Tirreno","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"RADIO PERLA","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4795074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noemi Arfuso","original_name":"Noemi Arfuso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667b57d77bf23f899706d2eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":914,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9sMoQp9xbLmVPdvchE3wWQjF6OJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ShorTS IFF","release_date":"2024-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
