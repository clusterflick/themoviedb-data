It takes us from boyhood with roots firmly embedded in the soil of Africa, through his political training with the African National Congress into the years of repression. Deeply involved with all the great anti-apartheid activities – the Defiance Campaign, the Freedom Charter, the Treason Trial, boycotts and strikes – Mandela was finally betrayed and sentenced to life imprisonment.","popularity":0.078,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":132742,"logo_path":null,"name":"Villon Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1986-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nelson Mandela: Prisoner to President","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1144857,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Davis","original_name":"Peter Davis","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c6c9dbe502ee7c131585f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0212379","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
