The dusky beauty is compelled to become the nurse of little Lucinia, the daughter of Marcellus. One day a party of Numidian's tribe, happening along, recognize her and carry her off, with little Lucinia. Setting out in a galley, a band of Roman warriors pursue them but fail to capture the fugitives. Lady Marcellus makes an offering at the shrine of the Goddess of the Sea, and in a visitation sees her little child with a slave in a strange place.
