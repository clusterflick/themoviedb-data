To some he was a lunatic, to others an artist. But to all, he was and still is a mystery.  António Tavares, an important contemporary dancer from Cabo Verde, made an exceptional performance piece based on the life and inner worlds of Kmêdeus. He takes us on a trip through his hometown of Mindelo, the island's music and films, and the celebration of the its annual carnival. It thus becomes a search for the root aspects of one of the oldest Creole communities in the world. Kmêdeus was made by the Cape Verdean film collective Negrume.","popularity":0.0723,"poster_path":"/sxiXOJjehHoI3hML9DRrpFAxzIj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134726,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kriolscope","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CV","name":"Cape Verde"}],"release_date":"2020-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kmêdeus","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2658053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"António Tavares","original_name":"António Tavares","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5ed00115e61e6d001ece211c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2655054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nuno Miranda","original_name":"Nuno Miranda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecd5b28d18b24002441d5c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2655054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nuno Miranda","original_name":"Nuno Miranda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed00063528b2e001e6605a8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2655054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nuno Miranda","original_name":"Nuno Miranda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed0010aaaec7100216773b4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2655054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nuno Miranda","original_name":"Nuno Miranda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed0007baaec71001f68711a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2658048,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pedro Soulé","original_name":"Pedro Soulé","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed0006d528b2e002067897a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12398210","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1151,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cc5XsU7OR3qqRZ50VDlEWLxYwub.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sxiXOJjehHoI3hML9DRrpFAxzIj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"We Are One: A Global Film Festival","release_date":"2020-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Kmêdeus – trailer | IFFR 2020","key":"KuwUSvGIPrM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-01-22T15:26:28.000Z","id":"5ecd5c21a3b5e6002059c434"}]}}}
