This habit makes it difficult for him to get a job so that every day he always quarrels with his mother. One day, because her mother is sick, Ramlie has to shop at the stall of Pak Mad Pantun and meets Laila, her idol. In order to maintain the prestige of Herman, the young rival of Ramlie to get Laila, Ramlie invites Laila to a weekly night even though at that time he did not have the money. Ramlie also racked his brain to look for capital to start looking for a loan from Mr. Mad Pantun and also toured the village. During his journey, Ramlie found interesting things that had been marginalized, especially Malay culture such as Makyong, traditional games and many more. Until he manages to meet Norma on the night of the week he dreams of, an unexpected incident becomes a turning point in his life.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/zXp8YSbFzuNX6mNSXJgrRZqmdob.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132721,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zettamind Studios","origin_country":""},{"id":132723,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nikifawa Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ramlie Oii Ramlie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2613118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Muhammad Rizki Sahlian","original_name":"Muhammad Rizki Sahlian","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Ramlie","credit_id":"5ea2b3653faba0002044b302","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2613119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sri Azizah","original_name":"Sri Azizah","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Laila","credit_id":"5ea2b3a5713ed4002451d657","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2613329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hardi S.
