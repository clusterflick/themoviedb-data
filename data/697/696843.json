As he strolls among the flowers, herbs and vegetables, there's a war for survival raging around him: from dangerous daddy longlegs and ferocious fire ants, to an eight-eyed jumping spider in a wrestling match with a belligerent bee. There's even a Top Gun-style air battle between a praying mantis and a bat. In this terrifying-and funny-new natural history comedy, National Geographic filmmakers use state-of-the-art cinematography to reveal what the world looks like from the insect's point of view.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/rFY6IZ4cpfn0FNlQU7x2KPScfRe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"National Geographic: The Savage Garden","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0897429","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1326,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rFY6IZ4cpfn0FNlQU7x2KPScfRe.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":884},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1326,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qhkaHv6F2z8rtY1OmJrL0oUVlAu.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":884},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xHIfpg6gXmQ7kN3HjitlkFxbbzm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
