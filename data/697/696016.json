The group was founded in 1972, initially with the help of revolutionaries from the 1968 movement.  For over 40 years, the group fought for better working conditions inside the plant. Over time, their incessant rank-and-file activism made the workers in Bochum the most radical in the entire German metal sector: Opel Bochum saw several wildcat strikes, and a persistent and successful fight for the reduction of daily working time. The group even attempted to build up direct links between different workforces of General Motors in Europe to fight back against the raise to the bottom of wages and working conditions in a situation of worldwide competition for investments amongst GM plants.  Their activities culminated in a six days wildcat strike in 2004.","popularity":0.049,"poster_path":"/2JfkPewIgLDFNgBo3ekxHvTVA31.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132632,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stiftung Menschenwürde und Arbeitswelt","origin_country":""},{"id":132633,"logo_path":null,"name":"Netzwerk der politische Förderfonds","origin_country":""},{"id":132634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rosa-Luxemburg-Stiftung","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Air to Breathe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2611191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willi Hajek","original_name":"Willi Hajek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Willi Hajek","credit_id":"5ea0501ebe4b3600195912e6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2611194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rainer Jansen","original_name":"Rainer Jansen","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Rainer Jansen","credit_id":"5ea050657aecc600257e689d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2611216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klaus Schmitz","original_name":"Klaus Schmitz","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Klaus Schmitz","credit_id":"5ea052607aecc6001f7e4f77","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1553662,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Birte Gerstenkorn","original_name":"Birte Gerstenkorn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea04e10223a8b001e6ebc6c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2611175,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Zara Zandieh","original_name":"Zara Zandieh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea04df8f1b57100218f3bf6","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2611172,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Thilo Schmidt","original_name":"Thilo Schmidt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea04e59f1b57100218f3d21","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2611172,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Thilo Schmidt","original_name":"Thilo Schmidt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea04da7f1b57100218f3b85","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2611174,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Milica Ðenić","original_name":"Milica Ðenić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea04de5162bc3001e035a24","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2573403,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joel Vogel","original_name":"Joel Vogel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea04e1b7aecc600257e65bf","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2611180,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Julien Bach","original_name":"Julien Bach","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea04e9007faa2001afa739e","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2611170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johanna Schellhagen","original_name":"Johanna Schellhagen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea04d48dd2589001dd18462","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2611179,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Zoff Kollektiv","original_name":"Zoff Kollektiv","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea04e45162bc30023034c68","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2611177,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tomi Simaputang","original_name":"Tomi Simaputang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea04e2b7aecc600257e65e7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2611178,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"AK Kessel","original_name":"AK Kessel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea04e347aecc6001f7e4ad5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/2JfkPewIgLDFNgBo3ekxHvTVA31.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":723}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Luft zum Atmen -
