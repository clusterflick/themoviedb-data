As one of Europe's largest predators, the decline of fish stocks and increase in competition, as well as legal seal hunting, has changed their entire world--and their behavior. Recent improvements in annual surveys and animal tagging have revealed precious information about where grey seals go when they leave the coast and how they spend their lives. Their name traditionally conjures up images of adorable pups and clownish behavior, but this film uncovers another side to these predators.","popularity":0.0968,"poster_path":"/iCv0i1ZPSFOGF1M6GjCKp76hE2R.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100703,"logo_path":"/9IE9Ufq245H68emvzgNJZ6Ke6F8.png","name":"Saint Thomas Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grey Seals: A Journey of Survival","video":true,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1894169,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bertrand Loyer","original_name":"Bertrand Loyer","popularity":0.059,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea303f76d1bb20024a2864b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14824796","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ymWAQuhQdcDRdEyZszPVINaAtbm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/iCv0i1ZPSFOGF1M6GjCKp76hE2R.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.737,"height":950,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ngglRFBnAStEpYPlGRIw2LSy0uB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"francais\", \"english_name\"=>\"French\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"fr\", \"native_name\"=>\"français\"}","note":"","release_date":"2016-08-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
