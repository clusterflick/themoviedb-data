This film shows how these Catskills communities were run by women, and how class divisions were reflected in the resort hotels: upwardly-mobile hotel guests were entertained by a who's-who of talent, while in the bungalows, do-it-yourself burlesque and vaudeville reigned among the blue-collar families. This film is happy, humane, ironic, and, finally, bittersweet, as we see that today's Jews no longer share the tastes or aspirations of their parents.","popularity":0.7924,"poster_path":"/3DM1oaOGqDyi84OE0GFRLvzbyD1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132742,"logo_path":null,"name":"Villon Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1986-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rise and Fall of the Borscht Belt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Wiseman","original_name":"Joseph Wiseman","popularity":0.4024,"profile_path":"/7QS6Z4rZ8kVimx10eeZ3r882Ahk.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self - Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5ea328fcaf4324001f9fb919","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1144857,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Davis","original_name":"Peter Davis","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654a91ce41a56133688572ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1144857,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Davis","original_name":"Peter Davis","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654a91d9532acb01380caa60","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2613526,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Steven Murray","original_name":"Steven Murray","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea328dfdb72c0001dbb85bb","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0299115","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2037,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3DM1oaOGqDyi84OE0GFRLvzbyD1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1358},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1883,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lSsBAVx8pCaaUI4iya62GlUdXtE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1256}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187249,"name":"catskills"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jewish Film Festival, Chicago","release_date":"1985-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Los Angeles, CA","release_date":"1986-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
