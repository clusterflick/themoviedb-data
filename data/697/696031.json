It deals with the convergence of disparate entities — geographies, epochs, sensibilities: with transitions from one state of being to another, and how within the frame of imagination and collective memory these 'dissolves' take place. \"Nostalgic images from Lucier's native Ohio — the pastoral countryside and a Victorian home — are fluidly juxtaposed and correlated with the lush beauty of Impressionist painter Claude Monet's gardens in Giverny, France.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/AixLDgky1vKnHW4FLSIkUCWVd6l.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ohio at Giverny","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Ohio to Giverny: Memory of Light","type":"single-channel version"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2611259,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mary Lucier","original_name":"Mary Lucier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea058a9f1b571001c8f1510","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lQo2kzSWedGiaJ8jNoOmp8R33B8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1324,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AixLDgky1vKnHW4FLSIkUCWVd6l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":883}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
