Since 1853, India's railway has been a unifying force. Not only did it physically link distant regions, it also connected the myriad of castes, languages, and religions that comprise India. It's a rich history, riding the sumptuous Palace on Wheels through Rajasthan or the \"toy train\" to Darjiing, but sadly, the age of steam is dying. At the Black Beauty contest, the beloved steam engines are admired for the last time. From the driver in the steaming locomotive to the station master in the sleepy village, from the family traveling to a wedding to the commuters in the large cities, this great institution reflects the country itself. Many are the faces, and varied are the stories, on THE GREAT INDIAN RAILWAY.","popularity":0.5852,"poster_path":"/t9CnuYUplljoQ7eEx4QDNkgViNY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7521,"logo_path":"/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png","name":"National Geographic","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Great Indian Railway","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2996500,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jeanne Rawlings Livingston","original_name":"Jeanne Rawlings Livingston","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"603ece40a9117f006dd13c04","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2996499,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Livingston","original_name":"William Livingston","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"603ece25dbad500030178e87","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2875044","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iaG644rbL28vKEgnOF5acHAU16m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t9CnuYUplljoQ7eEx4QDNkgViNY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":13008,"name":"train"},{"id":221355,"name":"nature documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
