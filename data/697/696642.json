The first is Birt Acres' work 'A Corner of Barnet Fair' which is the first film seen . This shows a merry-go-round and some people sitting in a doorway while street traffic goes by. The second film is a fragment of unknown origin of a street outside a very large building of what looks like a possible theatre, with a large Victorian awning. the shop next door appears to be selling wines and spirits. A horse drawn charabanc goes past, followed by a male bicyclist. This is closely followed by a male and female couple in an open carriage and two carts with workmen staring at the camera as they pass. Both films are believed to be from Barnet, given they have been spliced together. The film is in a deteriorated state with some rippling.","popularity":0.6724,"poster_path":"/5LcVykyExmSPDtSJUzrDMsWJgiJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132733,"logo_path":null,"name":"Northern Photographic Works","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1896-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Corner of Barnet Fair","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1161490,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Birt Acres","original_name":"Birt Acres","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/dJXIyjv7edcBCKJkNWy4fE5pmO8.jpg","credit_id":"5ea2f7b46d1bb2001da27287","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2224011","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r2G5tPhGYpCxjDYWWdzCTzqXT5o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5LcVykyExmSPDtSJUzrDMsWJgiJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/w2umIeI4qtL53Abd1UctyOxWH18.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wyRbOjhjlN5ZHOPwBDBbpmuNAV5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":13088,"name":"summer"},{"id":197808,"name":"fairground"},{"id":201930,"name":"leisure"},{"id":207928,"name":"19th century"},{"id":252596,"name":"victorian era"},{"id":334867,"name":"street scene"},{"id":334869,"name":"hertfordshire"},{"id":334870,"name":"barnet"},{"id":334871,"name":"pleasure fair"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1896-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
