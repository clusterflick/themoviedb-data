In this special documentary for ITV's acclaimed Exposure strand, the Bafta and Emmy-winning filmmaker Deeyah Khan asks a simple question : is it possible to reduce these endemic levels of male violence? In search of an answer, she hears heartfelt testimonies from survivors and victimsâ€™ families, and gets vital insights from social workers and psychologists who work with violent men. And she speaks to those whose voices are rarely heard in conversations about domestic violence yet hold the key to stopping it: the perpetrators themselves.","popularity":0.1443,"poster_path":"/bq6jIF13t12TafvVeCy9QNkAYDP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Behind the Rage: America's Domestic Violence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1874353,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deeyah Khan","original_name":"Deeyah Khan","popularity":0.0928,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6360bbe21dbc880090f566dc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1874353,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deeyah Khan","original_name":"Deeyah Khan","popularity":0.0928,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6360bc2f1b72940083140b89","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2052522,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michael Ho","original_name":"Michael Ho","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6360bf2d0f5265007c38d699","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2052517,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Darin Prindle","original_name":"Darin Prindle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6360bc6a07e2810082961f47","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22694398","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bq6jIF13t12TafvVeCy9QNkAYDP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":691}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"ITV","release_date":"2022-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
