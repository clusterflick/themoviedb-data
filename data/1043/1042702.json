A young man shouts this announcement into a megaphone and stars fall on the streets of the city. About fifteen young people, mostly girls, and a handful of boys, go through the casting process. They stop in front of Jacques Meilleurat’s camera to sing a song a cappella or accompanied by a guitar or ukulele. Stars is the continuation of their performances, cruelly captured in the summer light. It’s simple and moving, carried by the humble gift of these faces and voices risking everything in the raw, pure present moment of their singing.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stars","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2272935,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Meilleurat","original_name":"Jacques Meilleurat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63603ef51108a8007ea3e02e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21275672","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
