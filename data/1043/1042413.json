Set in the early '90s when local street gangs terrorized Manhattan’s Chinatown, our story centers on Detective Jack Yu investigating the murder of a teenage boy involved in a turf war. Amidst the broad distrust and racial divide between the Chinatown community and NYPD, our lone lawman searches for a nondescript immigrant family to deliver a shattering message that also brings forth his own conflicted relationship with Jack’s father.","popularity":1.1194,"poster_path":"/mXIpOhuDoU3nWxFF39RkvDhBII3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56629,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Rose Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Father's Son","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1319469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronny Chieng","original_name":"Ronny Chieng","popularity":0.7313,"profile_path":"/nn1y0te102CvakOJ0rSJ7rYPLDF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Detective Jack Yu","credit_id":"635f29a5bf0f63007dbd7a85","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tzi Ma","original_name":"Tzi Ma","popularity":1.0038,"profile_path":"/x4fz0LCIiBNGdil3nBYO22W7QJ0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Krang Li","credit_id":"635f2a1c1b7294009488d543","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1476038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Perry Yung","original_name":"Perry Yung","popularity":0.3562,"profile_path":"/y75jbS3TcOTItYdQzcwMAgHLhXg.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Wang Kei Yu","credit_id":"635f2a44e18e3f007c1cf6ae","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1485129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Randolph","original_name":"Christopher Randolph","popularity":0.1798,"profile_path":"/nM2yezcdOadUkVGsizIU5ge9zvP.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Capt.
