All access points to the border region were blocked in order not to create an escape corridor. Men, women and children were stuck in no man’s land – in the middle of winter, in the middle of the forest, for weeks. The film follows Polish activists on their mission. They learn that humanitarian aid, just like the refugees themselves, comes up against borders.","popularity":0.0218,"poster_path":"/UBjwZrXq6MNVAELMuxBcCDlYcS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":296,"logo_path":"/oPCnyumoJtIedjQoQin6zSSHkv8.png","name":"Filmakademie Baden-Württemberg","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2022-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Belarusian","iso_639_1":"be","name":"беларуская мова"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Border Conversations","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Border Conversatons","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2820241,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Brunner","original_name":"Jonathan Brunner","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635f8f4cefd3c2007aef9253","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3764844,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tristan Schneider","original_name":"Tristan Schneider","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635f8f6341eee1009117ce3d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2813880,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Marie Scholjegerdes","original_name":"Marie Scholjegerdes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635f8f801dbc880090f4ee42","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2072993,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Samuel Albert","original_name":"Samuel Albert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635f8f9540d0fe007acd05ca","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2622815,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Frederic Hellmann","original_name":"Frederic Hellmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6746d9530fd7f823e0c99996","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2820241,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Brunner","original_name":"Jonathan Brunner","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6746d96364f7e203eab1762d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt25213584","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1410,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/UBjwZrXq6MNVAELMuxBcCDlYcS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":940}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
