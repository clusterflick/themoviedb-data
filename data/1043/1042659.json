The father – a foolish, hotshot financier – collects miniature dioramas of historical atrocities as a hobby. Mother is a has-been prima donna fighting against the vagaries of age and fame. Inheriting their privilege and casual cruelty is daughter Amy, a rebellious if somewhat insular teenager longing to break out of her gilded cage. To gain a semblance of control over her cocooned existence, Amy produces an autobiographical mock-Kabuki performance that parodies her family.","popularity":0.1757,"poster_path":"/igIXp3IGoNl8LuJyekH7mdsvzNb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34602,"logo_path":"/w0tjrwPA1hYY2uJPmVTPvTz2hvJ.png","name":"De
