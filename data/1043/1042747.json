The eldest tells the others her memories as they act them out. On the set, papier-mâché settings and cardboard props with bright colours. A way to keep the violence of memory at bay, to make the visceral filmable? Traumatic episodes follow in rapid succession, with the car as their main setting: the brother’s death in a car accident when Lola was 6, her dog when she was 26, a break-up aged 30… This concatenation of representations and embodiments speeds through a destiny, until finally a pack of dogs brings back an element of unpredictability.
