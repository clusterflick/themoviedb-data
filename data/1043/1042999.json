Focusing on the relation between the spoken word, the literary text and the act of listening, the film explores the writerâ€™s work with her own tools: words. As the war intensifies, the dilemma increases: to speak or not to speak becomes a central question in the film. But if the filmed conversations are interrupted, who will tell the story of the voiceless? A pertinent poetic and political testimony of our troubled times.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":"/sSSkawG910W4ZIzSs4zpcpC7dQJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Fields of Words","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"In Fields of Words: Conversations with Samar Yazbek","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1304792,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rania Stephan","original_name":"Rania Stephan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636133f207e281007a9c8a48","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sSSkawG910W4ZIzSs4zpcpC7dQJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":724}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
