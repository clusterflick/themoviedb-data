It is also a story of El Cuarteto Aguilar, a very particular music band, which had an openly lesbian member in the first half of the last century. The discovery of the soundtrack of the lost film leads to a documentary collage that travels through Argentina, Spain and other parts of the world to ask again, one hundred years later, if perhaps the revolution is not also an aesthetic.","popularity":0.0961,"poster_path":"/kC3RgaLzXWvPWmjFRl2r3ZIJlNj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":185198,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ah!
