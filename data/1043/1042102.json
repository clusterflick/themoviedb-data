Now she is 16 and suffers from a terrible wound on her bladder that keeps her apart from her family and society. A glimpse of hope appears when a group of Latin-American and Spanish doctors travel to South Madagascar. Their goal is to cure patients with obstetric fistula, a taboo condition that keeps over 2 million women away from society. A documentary about people helping other people. An emotional and unprecedented insight into the heart of a modest surgery room where struggle and doubt emerge as the doctors battle with the limited resources they have available and the patients walk in knowing that this is the only hope to cure their illness. What's it like to have the power to cure others, while simultaneously confronting the limitations and vulnerabilities of your own human nature?","popularity":0.1152,"poster_path":"/3ykZdqZtJTuFwF499RNzxO6gjta.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2022-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malagasy","iso_639_1":"mg","name":""},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fifaliana","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1291253,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"José Cohen","original_name":"José Cohen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635e0a558289a00081bde459","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2117499,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miguel Labastida González","original_name":"Miguel Labastida González","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635e0a9f66565a007a2fe1c2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1801471,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marta Hernaiz Pidal","original_name":"Marta Hernaiz Pidal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635e0abc95c0af007a109cc4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":967253,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lorenzo Hagerman","original_name":"Lorenzo Hagerman","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/wTsfBGgTHuBkzu0N0LYyhjs3KIs.jpg","credit_id":"635e0a3e63d937007f14caec","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":967253,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lorenzo Hagerman","original_name":"Lorenzo Hagerman","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/wTsfBGgTHuBkzu0N0LYyhjs3KIs.jpg","credit_id":"635e0a7a66565a00827f2129","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":967253,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lorenzo Hagerman","original_name":"Lorenzo Hagerman","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/wTsfBGgTHuBkzu0N0LYyhjs3KIs.jpg","credit_id":"635e0a2195c0af0098f75be6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2377165,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Emilie Rex","original_name":"Emilie Rex","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635e0aebe263bb007c24bca7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":967253,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lorenzo Hagerman","original_name":"Lorenzo Hagerman","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/wTsfBGgTHuBkzu0N0LYyhjs3KIs.jpg","credit_id":"635e0ac8fd63000081983af6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1079368,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rick Alverson","original_name":"Rick Alverson","popularity":0.0672,"profile_path":"/b01fAeVRd4zlb5wX2LCKtfBazxR.jpg","credit_id":"635e0adb1b7294007beff3b7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1431105,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nicole Soriano","original_name":"Nicole Soriano","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635e0a66e2102300907061c9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29034299","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2572,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3ykZdqZtJTuFwF499RNzxO6gjta.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"Festival Internacional de Cine de Morelia (FICM)","release_date":"2022-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
