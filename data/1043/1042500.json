Meanwhile, in our country, not on that European patch where we hustle, constantly complaining, but on the whole vast Russian expanse, another life breathes. It depends little on everything that is commonly called the values ​​of civilization, but it breathes deeply. The harsh nature of the north, vast deserted expanses, sea and river fisheries, as one of the main sources of life support, all this formed a unique way of life for Russia, its own culture and even its own special language, which Lomonosov attributed along with Russian and \"Little Russian\" to the three main Russian dialects. All this together created a completely special human type, a special “Pomor character”, rooted in the White Sea land and absolutely self-sufficient in this rootedness.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pomors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937748,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dmitry Vasyukov","original_name":"Dmitry Vasyukov","popularity":0.0519,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635fa1f1e18e3f0090937152","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
