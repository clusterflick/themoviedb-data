Traditionally the caravans moved from Afar Depression to other parts of Ethiopia and to the Red Sea coastal regions of modern-day Eritrea and Djibouti. For centuries the control, trade and distribution of salt was of primary importance in the articulation of economic, social, and political life of the nomadic communities living along the caravan trails. Since 2010, trucks have slowly replaced the camel caravans. This has led to a steady decline in the trade. The film, relying on strong visual imagery and traditional Afar music, selected by the participant of this project, documents how the decline of this trade affects the daily life of the communities in Berahle district of North-eastern Ethiopia.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":"/qbZ7Dc5ig0WEXrw0p1GVJD8P0mv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afar","iso_639_1":"aa","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arho – The Afar Salt Trade of Northeastern Ethiopia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3764958,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Till Jakob Frederik Trojer","original_name":"Till Jakob Frederik Trojer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635fba931b7294007bf07ee4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3597683,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tesfahun Haddis","original_name":"Tesfahun Haddis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d379b48de0ae0163d895d8","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3764958,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Till Jakob Frederik Trojer","original_name":"Till Jakob Frederik Trojer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d379e8dc86470162c6e293","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31394181","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":821,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qbZ7Dc5ig0WEXrw0p1GVJD8P0mv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":581},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wrJL2hu8tLZE2MOz4h4tEMsbg7J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"OKO International Etnographic Film Festival","release_date":"2021-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Mimesis Documentary Festival","release_date":"2020-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Архо / Arho – The Afar Salt Trade of Northeastern Ethiopia - Trailer","key":"On9dEfsz56k","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-07-31T23:28:28.000Z","id":"65d3786cf495ee017c408427"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Arho - The Afar Salt Trade of Northeastern Ethiopia - Trailer","key":"547654226","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-05-10T19:49:06.000Z","id":"65d37856387651016331ae4d"}]}}}
