Can we decide to go mad? Can madness be contagious? Or is reality inconsistent and dependent on our perception? Can we survive without others? Two university students, Ana and MaÃÅrio, want to test their relationship with reality by entering a voluntary strange experience of self-confinement. Surrounded by a deep forest and focusing entirely on a computer strategy game, reality blurs with fantasy and slowly they experience spheres that have not been visible before.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forest Paths","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1609855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christine Reeh","original_name":"Christine Reeh","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/kYXhwiQ85fWZNAM0J1TCNmSdL9m.jpg","credit_id":"63610576efd3c2007af01b4c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
