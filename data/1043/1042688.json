Most Jewish traditions on Planet Matzah Ball have been lost. One starry night, just before Pasover, an Intergalactic Passover Guide Book comes crashing down on Planet Matzah Ball. The curious Jewish aliens who discover it decide to follow its instructions and have a Seder of their own! But there's a problem: they need someone to lead the Seder who will make sure that the most important parts of the Passover story are told.  Oogy volunteers to find a leader and travels to Planet Earth on his spaceship in search of one. Crash landing in Cleveland, Ohio, right in the middle of the Rosenberg family Seder, he learns everything about Passover. But when it's time to return to Planet Matzah Ball Oogy realizes that he hasn't accomplished his mission, for he still hasn't found a leader for his seder - or has he?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/yOUrQQBJ27ZswKCjnmPnDb60MQg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Seder on Planet Matzah Ball","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1397047,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victor DiNapoli","original_name":"Victor DiNapoli","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6360350c3396b9007d61533d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1217341,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cathi Turow","original_name":"Cathi Turow","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636035ab511d09007d16de8d","department":"Writing","job":"Lyricist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3765513,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yale Roe","original_name":"Yale Roe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636035d841eee1007a0df519","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3765514,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kenneth Schur","original_name":"Kenneth Schur","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636035ee1108a80092414a04","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3765521,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stephen J.
