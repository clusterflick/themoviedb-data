Central is a range of anthropomorphous characters voicing their conflicting perspectives on consent and complicity. An adaptation of Millais' Ophelia comes back to life through karaoke. A white male default 3D avatar generates empty buzzwords to apologize for being involved in issues of harassment. A singing ensemble of oysters share their concerns about the abuse of power, allegorically hinting at their gendered, art-historical, and ecological connotations. The Aquatic Apes are depicted as otherworldly mid-evolution creatures with sexualized and animalistic features, and vocalized dolphin-like sounds translated into subtitles. Connecting all characters is the reference to water as a unifying element, exposing its undeniable sexual, biological, and environmental interpretations.","popularity":0.0661,"poster_path":"/dQ2EntEv3wD4mN8GqFnhYUneDDN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2018-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BAIT","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3763816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Puck Verkade","original_name":"Puck Verkade","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635e51d3e18e3f0079f83b6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1613,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dQ2EntEv3wD4mN8GqFnhYUneDDN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1076}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"LISTE â€“ Art Fair Basel","release_date":"2018-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
