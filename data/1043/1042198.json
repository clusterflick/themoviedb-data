Today he’s in Moscow, in an undisclosed hotel room, on the run and at risk of assassination.  Last week, a nobody. This week, America’s Most Wanted: a man who humiliated his country with one touch of a button.  Mike Bartlett’s darkly comic new play explores the unexpected, bewildering, and life-changing consequences of challenging the status quo at a global level. As the State grows more powerful because of technology, and technology grows more powerful because of the State, where do the self-appointed protectors of the rights of the citizen stand? Heroes? Or traitors?","popularity":0.2839,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":185199,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hampstead Theatre","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hampstead Theatre At Home: Wild","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Wild","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1914302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caoilfhionn Dunne","original_name":"Caoilfhionn Dunne","popularity":0.1574,"profile_path":"/96GTcKtmXe0mU9yaMhGvRxrqkJU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Woman","credit_id":"635e720db87aec007c2aee15","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1287084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Farthing","original_name":"Jack Farthing","popularity":0.2178,"profile_path":"/xhriXePjVXTJcF2linudLgMnsKA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Andrew","credit_id":"635e721db87aec007c2aee20","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2019290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Mackay","original_name":"John Mackay","popularity":0.1211,"profile_path":"/9xguSSaWEUE8XpYmARZpGpmiAAQ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Man","credit_id":"635e722d0c3ec8007905e6c4","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1137219,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Peter Mumford","original_name":"Peter Mumford","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635e72f4fd6300007e40cd18","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1257471,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mike Bartlett","original_name":"Mike Bartlett","popularity":0.0695,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635e724c8289a00079582089","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1479314,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christopher Shutt","original_name":"Christopher Shutt","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635e73070c3ec80090b4bc5a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2606383,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Miriam Buether","original_name":"Miriam Buether","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635e72e2fd63000079a92c51","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1404262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James MacDonald","original_name":"James MacDonald","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635e72bf66565a007f89ee42","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10123,"name":"dark comedy"},{"id":305850,"name":"hampstead theatre"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
