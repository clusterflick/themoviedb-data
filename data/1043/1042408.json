More than that, the short film plunges into the daily life of a couple to tell the story behind the non-history of a body full of silences: she is a transvestite; he is a cis: there is a concrete wall between them where it is impossible to see beyond. And this Thing that separates the bodies; this Thing for which the character asks help - for this there is no name.","popularity":0.1325,"poster_path":"/jYmyoadoq4JM7pw54LZOzw2BZNB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rosa Neon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4301758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luna Ventura","original_name":"Luna Ventura","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"651a8b27ea84c7010c138d9b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4301759,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcos Coletta","original_name":"Marcos Coletta","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"651a8b2a9d592c00c8c3b58f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4301761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luan Nobat","original_name":"Luan Nobat","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"651a8b3f9d592c0102c0864f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3611990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariana Sena","original_name":"Mariana Sena","popularity":0.2552,"profile_path":"/tTk5VUH8O0hCuEVhCe4ENpqryIh.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"67729f505b8f422b60128315","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3887450,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Vagner Jabour","original_name":"Vagner Jabour","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651a8b0ac50ad200ad814c3a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Braga","original_name":"Alice Braga","popularity":1.6618,"profile_path":"/4n2nxCISzji3z3QvrpXVkJJkTG.jpg","credit_id":"651a8aea967cc7342609e14f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3764516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tiago Tereza","original_name":"Tiago Tereza","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651a8ae093bd690138fe6f3f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3764516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tiago Tereza","original_name":"Tiago Tereza","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651a8ada93bd6900acc7be0a","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1987033,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leonardo Barcelos","original_name":"Leonardo Barcelos","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651a8b0074507d01395a5104","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3764516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tiago Tereza","original_name":"Tiago Tereza","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635f2403590086007e3b4250","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":5028045,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mavi Turíbio","original_name":"Mavi Turíbio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/xmFjrbFro3LHXdInpTUez4JzmRp.jpg","credit_id":"671fee1634c0fabd681d3b46","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jYmyoadoq4JM7pw54LZOzw2BZNB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dS2HsuYh58lsOe07BXTOXAbnsF3.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
