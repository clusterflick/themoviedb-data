The botanist Odile Dubuisson and her daughter Marie explore the jungles of northern Laos, 150 years later, following in the footsteps of their illustrious ancestor. Referring to a poem by the explorer: On the branch of the bamboo / The larva of the butterfly / One day will become a flower, Odile understands that he has seen the giant bamboo bloom.
