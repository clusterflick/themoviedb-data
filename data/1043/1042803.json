The MEMORY SERIES compresses 10 years of Video8 footage in 10 MEGABYTES, 1 MEGABYTE and 1000 BITS OF MEMORY. The algorithm is working, memory is fading, images are becoming more and more abstract. Compression relates to an aesthetic of the small file format, a counter strategy against the ever increasing resolution, bitrate and (environmental) cost of digital images. It also allows for the manipulation of the material basis of images itself.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/lCIqhSj9kwJXTjIadtjz2aWbLTs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memory Series","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2759300,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Markus Maicher","original_name":"Markus Maicher","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636098071dbc880090f55863","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lCIqhSj9kwJXTjIadtjz2aWbLTs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
