Nour leaves her home to join friends gathered in an apartment. As the last rays of light disappear in the sky, layers of sounds echoing traces of past events every night in the accumulate atmosphere. But tonight seems to be different. Different characters have been complaining about a pervasive migraine. Others have noticed a persistent whirring sound looming over the city. The sonic scape gradually turns into a strident sound. Time seems to suddenly dilate. The night is prolonged, slowly turning into an eternal night.
