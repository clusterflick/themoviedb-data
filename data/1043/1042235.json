A young woman lies motionless in the moss, her legs scratched. But she wakes up. Diana doesn't ask, she takes care of her. The 23-year-old Pia is still foggy. She doesn't know anything about last night, so she instinctively goes into the hands of her childish rescuer, grateful that she does not have to explain to her counterpart. The two give each other the greatest gift, time and attention and fill up the mental empty spaces.","popularity":0.1021,"poster_path":"/A4K3BTMWMLlOqAH222hFrKkBNeX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2022-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pia Piano","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3764086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johanna Schneider","original_name":"Johanna Schneider","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Diana","credit_id":"635e8d5295c0af007f825086","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3764087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna-Maria Bednarzik","original_name":"Anna-Maria Bednarzik","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Pia","credit_id":"635e8d840c3ec8007905f10d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3767724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lina Schneider","original_name":"Lina Schneider","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"63628a15a6a4c1007fbfbd5d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1623636,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Astrid Leberti","original_name":"Astrid Leberti","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"63628a220c3ec80090b6236e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3767726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Kislinskyi","original_name":"Alexander Kislinskyi","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"63628a36d04d1a007976160a","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":44662,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sylke Enders","original_name":"Sylke Enders","popularity":0.146,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63628957fd6300007e429f33","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":44662,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sylke Enders","original_name":"Sylke Enders","popularity":0.146,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6362898d7f6c8d0082589901","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bWOqv6SvJfDu1unzcRj9vojMsvv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sECdm3ILvs504n1RD5m1eRNSGtg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eCVb04QPfwj32RbBSjIl54rb5SV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/A4K3BTMWMLlOqAH222hFrKkBNeX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
