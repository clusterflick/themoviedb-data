Left adrift for almost a year due to quarantines, many saw their daily lives radically changed.  For those who had to live this time alone, life became an endless monologue. What used to be day-to-day became something distant and strange. At the same time, home activities were now the only escape.  Bars, cinemas, trips, urban transport... all of this became a world isolated by a void thousands of kilometres away.  All of this became our new normal, a distant outside world and a strange inside world, a new world, an alien world.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/gw6KtCepPfVPzVvCjMU4l5kdAb2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"2022-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"aLONE","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3766370,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Lopez Ramirez","original_name":"David Lopez Ramirez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63611a0efd63000079aa1471","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gw6KtCepPfVPzVvCjMU4l5kdAb2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":560}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Ealing Film Festival 2022","release_date":"2022-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
