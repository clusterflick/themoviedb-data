The Eyerís along with the sailors are confined by Pinzón, the captain of the ship, in houses far from the village while he notifies the return of the expedition to the Catholic Monarchs. Everyone celebrates the return to land while awaiting the return of the Captain, but the twins come with a mission: to inseminate the land of the foreigners. To do so, Guaba must die and become seed and Bohique must get it and sow it. Guaba’s spirit guides Rui Gallego and his brother, the only witnesses to his death, to find the seed. The Eyerís instruct the sailors in the formation of the conucos, the Eyerí method of sowing.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Se van sus naves","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2092678,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Óscar Vincentelli","original_name":"Óscar Vincentelli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6361045040d0fe008267f7cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
