In fact, \"Every Pixel Tells a Story\" is an example of what can be accomplished on digital video. Producer-director Peter Hanson shot and edited the movie in a matter of weeks using a camcorder, a computer editing system, and a $30 microphone from Radio Shack, all while spending a fraction of what the documentary would have cost had it been shot on film.","popularity":0.1144,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Every Pixel Tells a Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":119728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Hanson","original_name":"Peter Hanson","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56b4c0e9c3a36806ee00527d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1110251","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":33490,"name":"filmmaking"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2002-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
