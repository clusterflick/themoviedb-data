Big topics, but seen from a new and original perspective in a film based on a simple idea: that one's sense of time ceases to function when one dies, and that one for a short – or in fact very long – moment has the chance to experience eternity. And to therefore live in a single memory forever. Which one would you choose? 'I Remember When I Die' takes place at life's last destination, a hospice, but is a poetic and vital journey into the borderland of consciousness, and right into a possible afterlife.","popularity":0.1784,"poster_path":"/xfQHK37OtzwJB9I7b8jdgwRy2B7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2015-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Remember When I Die","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1574862,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jacob Kirkegaard","original_name":"Jacob Kirkegaard","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56b9d19b92514106aa002278","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":132242,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mimmi Spång","original_name":"Mimmi Spång","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56b9d172c3a3681e68002e97","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1574861,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Julius Krebs Damsbo","original_name":"Julius Krebs Damsbo","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/6eyaMc674X2L50V8l3zI2T82VIw.jpg","credit_id":"56b9d08ec3a3681e5900259f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1197712,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anna-Maria Kantarius","original_name":"Anna-Maria Kantarius","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56b9d12cc3a3681e6000206f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":132241,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rebecka Lafrenz","original_name":"Rebecka Lafrenz","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/xMMZI9tSCeix9IJVDZF6sIZs4BL.jpg","credit_id":"56b9d151c3a3681e7d00223b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1574859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Bäck","original_name":"Maria Bäck","popularity":0.101,"profile_path":"/eXS4ixCM3FHG3iyyuhk8yZJkOXa.jpg","credit_id":"56b9cff292514106a4002066","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1574860,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Maria von Hausswolff","original_name":"Maria von Hausswolff","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/etGgw29Ol78fVOrWMio8wUMUHDc.jpg","credit_id":"5710c1bbc3a36860a80045ed","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1574859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Bäck","original_name":"Maria Bäck","popularity":0.101,"profile_path":"/eXS4ixCM3FHG3iyyuhk8yZJkOXa.jpg","credit_id":"677e75b9c81acaa63dbb1629","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5094682","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A53RMmjuns30QHIlALPpZUZlg8w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xfQHK37OtzwJB9I7b8jdgwRy2B7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":34079,"name":"death"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
