No matter who the crowd, best friends Noah, New Michael, Jack and Ethan have one simple mantra: “We would much rather the audience appreciate us as comedians than people who have overcome adversity.”  In this coming-of-age heartfelt documentary, this band of brothers finds themselves at a crossroad. With real life pulling them apart, they decide to plan one ambitious farewell show before they all go their separate ways. People with Asperger’s don’t deal well with uncertainty, and this is the most uncertain time in their lives.","popularity":0.6579,"poster_path":"/wcjQ3xU4eM2ZcrLsvJQQilhTthH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1974,"logo_path":"/t8p2PpDBJo282a5TTr6Ln0wVkMZ.png","name":"Duplass Brothers Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Asperger's Are Us","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":20,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noah Britton","original_name":"Noah Britton","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"586c0886c3a3682856000a93","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethan Finlan","original_name":"Ethan Finlan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"586c0886925141483d0008d0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Hanke","original_name":"Jack Hanke","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"586c0887c3a3682859000b4e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732189,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"New Michael Ingemi","original_name":"New Michael Ingemi","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"586c0887925141484500094f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1198148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Proksch","original_name":"Mark Proksch","popularity":0.7733,"profile_path":"/5sgun1ZeWUaoz5TSvC7rvYBeWCC.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"","credit_id":"5faadfd7d6d64d003f7810df","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1049745,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alexandre Lehmann","original_name":"Alexandre Lehmann","popularity":0.1754,"profile_path":"/riumngni49YhtKBYYEX0WptpMYY.jpg","credit_id":"56b278419251410338000d64","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1714718,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sydney Fleischmann","original_name":"Sydney Fleischmann","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"583a4c55925141139000025c","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1714717,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Omar J.
