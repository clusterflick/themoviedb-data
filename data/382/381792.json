The Trout is an exuberant explosion of youthful enjoyment in music: first from Schubert himself, who wrote his famous Trout quintet when he was 22 years old, and then from five young artists of the highest rank. They pick up the spirit of Schubert's music magnificently, both in preparation and rehearsal, and in their 1969 performance of the work, which has become one of the most remembered ever given.  Includes personal introductions by Christopher Nupen and Jacqueline du Pré and features the legendary 1969 performance of The Trout with Daniel Barenboim, Itzhak Perlman, Jacqueline du Pré, Pinchas Zukerman and Zubin Mehta.","popularity":0.2907,"poster_path":"/zVp7IDXvgmKepzgLOIh0KkVtfHD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4775,"logo_path":"/z1HSU7AQ04jeOICLE1mBzEJxiEJ.png","name":"Opus Arte","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":4899,"logo_path":null,"name":"Allegro Films","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Trout","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":166002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Itzhak Perlman","original_name":"Itzhak Perlman","popularity":0.2687,"profile_path":"/yELJweqEW6lzEIKlZJNQbEZprD8.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Violinist","credit_id":"57a385f09251414b1e00034a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1116025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pinchas Zukerman","original_name":"Pinchas Zukerman","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":"/9vP6D3c89928juN8n0zDP6vDhwP.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Violist","credit_id":"56b901809251410541000d72","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1656511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacqueline du Pré","original_name":"Jacqueline du Pré","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/1Z7OANIfX3ol2l34S7siXrzVZLZ.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Cellist","credit_id":"663a1ccfe92d830127d4a427","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141318,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zubin Mehta","original_name":"Zubin Mehta","popularity":0.1571,"profile_path":"/yqPAUNt9QLvLSLOBcVjXboe9s5W.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Double bassist","credit_id":"56b9016c9251410547000cfa","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Barenboim","original_name":"Daniel Barenboim","popularity":0.1008,"profile_path":"/pNoHzRlu3vNQmQsB7XrmrFYjOd1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Pianist","credit_id":"56b90155c3a368747e000d48","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1656347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimir Ashkenazy","original_name":"Vladimir Ashkenazy","popularity":0.0998,"profile_path":"/wgESY3384x00YZgyopCEt05695T.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5796688ac3a3680d180007f8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1656465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Sanderling","original_name":"Michael Sanderling","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"579668979251417e8a0005f7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1656466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antje Weithaas","original_name":"Antje Weithaas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"579668b5c3a3680d18000812","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1569666,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Sawallisch","original_name":"Wolfgang Sawallisch","popularity":0.1928,"profile_path":"/pK9XCXV4ta4ZBDOUZtjaYeaounz.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"579668c8c3a3680c9e0006ab","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1574617,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Nupen","original_name":"Christopher Nupen","popularity":0.1149,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56b90149c3a368747e000d44","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6551350","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zVp7IDXvgmKepzgLOIh0KkVtfHD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
