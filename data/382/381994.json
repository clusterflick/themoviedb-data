After having had to leave the country fifteen years ago, prodigal son Rodrigo finally returns to the family farm in Mercedaria to introduce his wife Bianca to his parents. He’s not really looking forward to this family reunion. His youth was spent working with the slaves on the farm who were treated without mercy by his parents. His father regularly abused the female slaves, while his mother even burned one alive to save the family honor. It’s time for some ghostly revenge and this happens to coincide with Rodrigo’s return.","popularity":0.3453,"poster_path":"/5O3vRNS3FMz9Ox2gxL8LoYe7YR2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73018,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sinema","origin_country":""},{"id":10188,"logo_path":"/es95AfZkgSEFwxub9zfhrjlnnCc.png","name":"Aleph","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2015-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
