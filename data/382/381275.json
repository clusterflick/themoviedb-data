Her flowing forms were in part a reaction to the rigid structures of then-popular minimalism, a male-dominated movement. Hesse’s complicated personal life encompassed not only a chaotic 1930s Germany, but also illness and the immigrant culture of New York in the 1940s. One of the twentieth century’s most intriguing artists, she finally receives her due in this film, an emotionally gripping journey with a gifted woman of great courage.","popularity":0.4771,"poster_path":"/veuIYTtajv1IJgr3tKUGUGkniOI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eva Hesse","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Tracing the Rope: Eva Hesse, Life + Work","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":11826,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Selma Blair","original_name":"Selma Blair","popularity":1.2375,"profile_path":"/5KfULwS7ZPZc6Ac1OP0ka2PhZZy.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Eva Hesse (voice)","credit_id":"56b3d99a92514114eb002aca","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Balaban","original_name":"Bob Balaban","popularity":0.8094,"profile_path":"/tLUlpF9EDxxRh6nM8AZ5BsPKc2B.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Wilhelm Hesse (voice)","credit_id":"56b3d9b092514114eb002ace","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Kennedy","original_name":"Patrick Kennedy","popularity":0.3441,"profile_path":"/Aj7lwhi4rYfzP5OZJiem5w72re8.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sol Lewitt (voice)","credit_id":"56b3d9e2925141662c000650","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2851553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Doyle","original_name":"Tom Doyle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60e96d7043250f004717a1c7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69060,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Werner Nekes","original_name":"Werner Nekes","popularity":0.0941,"profile_path":"/wc3DqK6qU7XYXVqWuAFOTeQtphX.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60e96d774ca676005e1f946e","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1572681,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcie Begleiter","original_name":"Marcie Begleiter","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e96c5812b10e005d7a58a5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1572681,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcie Begleiter","original_name":"Marcie Begleiter","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e96c88ec8a43005da11b46","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":17048,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nancy Schreiber","original_name":"Nancy Schreiber","popularity":0.1268,"profile_path":"/vu2SJcVX4naMHe4zRPT4vbXRTWF.jpg","credit_id":"60e96cb1ec8a43005da11b7e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":992021,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Azin Samari","original_name":"Azin Samari","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e96cbb9979d2005de52d6e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2196967,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Karen S.
