With little information on how 1 Para Brigade's battle went the day before or what faced them on the ground the stage was set for an epic battle. John Waddy, v company commander in 156 Para Battalion and a team of  Arnhem experts cover the ground where 4 Para Brigade fought  with 9 SS Pz Div in the woods to the west of Arnhem in what was to be an unequal but heroic battle; the result of a flawed concept and plan.Driven back  the Brigade was withdrawing across LZ  P when the Polish heavy lift  gliders swept in to cause. Captain Quirepel was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for his action in helping stem the enemy advance long enough for the Paratroopers to escape across the railway embankment by nightfall.","popularity":0.4098,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":69941,"logo_path":null,"name":"Battlefield History TV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Operation Market Garden: Arnhem - Battle of the Woods","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"ARNHEM - BATTLE OF THE WOODS - OPERATION MARKET GARDEN","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1550101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Saunders","original_name":"Tim Saunders","popularity":0.1265,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Director and Presenter","credit_id":"56b48240c3a36806f800427e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1572891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Greenacre","original_name":"John Greenacre","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56b48254c3a36806f8004285","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1572893,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jo Hook","original_name":"Jo Hook","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56b482809251417dca001100","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1572376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Hilton","original_name":"Bob Hilton","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56b4829792514114e50045b6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1553249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Peters","original_name":"Mike Peters","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56b482a992514114d90045e3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1552508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Dormer","original_name":"Tom Dormer","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56b482c092514114e50045bc","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4100,"name":"british army"},{"id":162365,"name":"military"},{"id":193900,"name":"arnhem"},{"id":222687,"name":"german army"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
