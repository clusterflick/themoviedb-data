The hope of Toksook Bay is Byron Nicholai, a 16-year-old Yup’ik eskimo who is determined to lead his village to the championship. Byron’s father abandoned him when he was 14 and never taught him how to hunt in the traditional Yupik way. For Byron, this tournament isn’t just about basketball—it’s a way to bring pride to his family and community.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/fkkPGTLNHHfMNufh1pNtJX4bcRK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am Yup'ik","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":979773,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniele Anastasion","original_name":"Daniele Anastasion","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56ba5b60c3a3687c9b000aa0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406639,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nathan Golon","original_name":"Nathan Golon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56d72e32925141340201704b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5258442","wikidata_id":"Q27042148","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fkkPGTLNHHfMNufh1pNtJX4bcRK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":999}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Sundance Film Festival","release_date":"2016-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
