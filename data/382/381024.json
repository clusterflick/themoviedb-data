Bonded by their dreams to fight social injustice and spread peace, this unlikely band of free-spirited idealists quickly transformed into a drug-smuggling empire and at the same time inadvertently invented the modern illegal drug trade. At the head of the Brotherhood, and the heart of this story, is the anti-capitalistic husband and wife team, who made it their mission to change the world through LSD.","popularity":0.8962,"poster_path":"/p9ZowUlMNX74031cxX86fZVEP4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The true story of friends, family & one hundred million hits of acid","title":"Orange Sunshine","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":15,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1572137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Delgado","original_name":"Michael Delgado","popularity":0.1593,"profile_path":"/biAj5hY3q8i1dbu5UW9i66HS9aF.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Drug Smuggler","credit_id":"56b26ee69251410338000c93","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1432300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taylor Bottles","original_name":"Taylor Bottles","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Neal Purcell","credit_id":"56b26ef19251410345000c6d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1572138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gunner Greyson","original_name":"Gunner Greyson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/3FUjdwcubFlLU1uoGZp6ZxjVOKR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Michael Randall","credit_id":"56b26efec3a36845b7000c9a","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1572136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William A.
