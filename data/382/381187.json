Thanks to her media-effective appearances, Carla has made a difference in the Third World and, after eventful years abroad, is now looking forward to her pastorate in Cologne. Here she finally wants to take care of her daughter Sarah, who is in a marital crisis. But nothing goes as planned: Sarah resists her domineering mother, and Carla's promised position is already occupied by someone else. The pastor is forced to take over a small church in Sauerland, where she has to start from scratch.","popularity":0.3226,"poster_path":"/x00Q04zJuSf3Xsok46j8bsHl8ZQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2005-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dem
