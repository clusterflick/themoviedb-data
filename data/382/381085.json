Ralf wanted to realize this project ever since he had heard Jimmy‘s voice singing for the first time 30 years ago. But it took a personal tragedy to finally put his thoughts into action. Meeting Jimmy Scott at the age of 85 years living secluded and chairbound after an accident in Las Vegas Ralf was shocked by Jimmy‘s surprisingly bad health condition. Will he be able to put his plan into reality?","popularity":0.4589,"poster_path":"/eyTiKAvgkx6TQiJDGYg8atxz1iy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Go Back Home - Jimmy Scott","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"I Go Back Home","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1210654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Scott","original_name":"Jimmy Scott","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58e3f48292514128100223df","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Sanborn","original_name":"David Sanborn","popularity":0.1107,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56b289689251410347000e8f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13301,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Quincy Jones","original_name":"Quincy Jones","popularity":0.5555,"profile_path":"/5gLBCGdhwCXmA0ns5E3pMmIHvpv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56b28979c3a36845c9000e4f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Pesci","original_name":"Joe Pesci","popularity":1.5624,"profile_path":"/1WHLXwT0TDZDWFVRcFve1B0EjNK.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56b28970c3a36845b4000f32","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1572197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yoon-ha Chang","original_name":"Yoon-ha Chang","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56b28950925141434a000477","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5532314","wikidata_id":"Q24705273","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1416,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eyTiKAvgkx6TQiJDGYg8atxz1iy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Joe Pesci, Quincy Jones & Dee Dee Bridgewater for Jimmy Scotts tribute album \"I go back home\"","key":"T4oTtcCCN-M","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-08-10T10:45:54.000Z","id":"6429f2a901b1ca00b62a8d14"}]}}}
