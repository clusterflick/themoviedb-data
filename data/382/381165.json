Leo Peret has a small quiet tobacco shop in Greenwich Village. Edward Livingston, a wealthy young clubman and man-about-town, comes in frequently ostensibly to buy cigarettes but in reality to talk to the daughter Jeannette, and he is soon in love with the little shop girl. Leo is homesick for his native France, but lacks the funds to make the passage. Edward, learning of their plight, sends $1,000 with a note saying that the money is payment for a good deed. Leo accepts the money and he and Jeannette embark at once.","popularity":0.6821,"poster_path":"/odQVMYoLgPssySkhbybNYhmT8Fx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13400,"logo_path":null,"name":"Artcraft Pictures Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Greatest Thing in Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Une fleur dans les ruines","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Gish","original_name":"Lillian Gish","popularity":0.6523,"profile_path":"/6DCWtvv654sc8p2OPnxGbKvl2qC.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jeannette Peret","credit_id":"56b32df2c3a36806ee00164a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Harron","original_name":"Robert Harron","popularity":0.2252,"profile_path":"/8uqveFAwItcd5Ty2OEMPM37bbZb.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Edward Livingston","credit_id":"56b32e0fc3a368070000150f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Butler","original_name":"David Butler","popularity":0.2767,"profile_path":"/7AiCqLg957EPeCzBxdv39D8igdc.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mr. Le Bebe","credit_id":"56b32e6bc3a36806f80014b3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1352995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peaches Jackson","original_name":"Peaches Jackson","popularity":0.1288,"profile_path":"/AnQQFraFeqKTgiGUPcfceS9ZzR0.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Miss Peaches","credit_id":"56b32e8892514114e10016dc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolph Lestina","original_name":"Adolph Lestina","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/r7mwL8DBUy7A9MDgRejog9R2TPE.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Leo Peret","credit_id":"56b32ea192514114e10016e8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":580811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elmo Lincoln","original_name":"Elmo Lincoln","popularity":0.1319,"profile_path":"/dIWWIz9A7VIa73VYNzSe2XpzIHF.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"The American Soldier","credit_id":"56b32ee692514114e8001612","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Peil Sr.","original_name":"Edward Peil Sr.","popularity":0.1344,"profile_path":"/tkebpmT8PggXYd2Qu028umqEZzc.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"The German Officer","credit_id":"56b32f0092514114e10016f2","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":145109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Bruce","original_name":"Kate Bruce","popularity":0.1372,"profile_path":"/oLC99DsB0gkPdsZJRi0d1D1B4hD.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Jeannette's Aunt","credit_id":"56b32f1892514114e8001618","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8819,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Billy Bitzer","original_name":"Billy Bitzer","popularity":0.1214,"profile_path":"/9nNC55iPLBuBK8KwQUoiK06piHW.jpg","credit_id":"56b32da4c3a36806e60015eb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100036,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"D.W.
