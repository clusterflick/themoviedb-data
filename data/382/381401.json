In this film, Dr Hannah Fry tells the story of Ada's remarkable life. Born in the early 19th century, Ada was a countess of the realm, a scandalous socialite and an 'enchantress of numbers'. The film is an enthralling tale of how a life infused with brilliance, but blighted by illness and gambling addiction, helped give rise to the modern era of computing.","popularity":0.6113,"poster_path":"/y043XSpsca4bps1vFzoyx5lgdxl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3712,"logo_path":"/7PdJYn2l0iBViud7oqxRHO9UEIR.png","name":"BBC Scotland","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Calculating Ada: The Countess of Computing","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1573208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannah Fry","original_name":"Hannah Fry","popularity":0.3959,"profile_path":"/rWbrOdtlxGhX1C22hyVYiVqwoqI.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self - Presenter","credit_id":"56b538f592514112b9005451","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1265159,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nat Sharman","original_name":"Nat Sharman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56b53912c3a3680700005d84","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1265159,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nat Sharman","original_name":"Nat Sharman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56b5391b9251414a25000767","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006823,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Thompson","original_name":"Andrew Thompson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56b5392e92514114e500618b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5980290","wikidata_id":"Q79221527","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2n71eckscDda1WasubWji12TtUa.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xiLSluTjmH8PUYxJ2uR3ehX8A8y.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/y043XSpsca4bps1vFzoyx5lgdxl.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9RecfdBsPqugrvLUgtFUueXzUDl.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/52jdVAf8ONGLavAVERdTJCWqYOl.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ttQnhWkDshVHH2bCuXZzJWwJQkd.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hL3kw8AOrJtXyYfLuVssKTtMD5C.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6104,"name":"computer"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"BBC4","release_date":"2015-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
