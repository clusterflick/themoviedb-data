Wearing only normal uniforms, the 101st joined the other garrison troops in a siege where they fought not only the enemy's panzers but the freezing, snowy, cold to hold the vital road junction. Filmed on the ground we tell the story of the heroic defence of Bastogne.","popularity":0.4958,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Battle of the Bulge: Siege of Bastogne","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"SIEGE OF BASTOGNE - BATTLE OF THE BULGE","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1550098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Duff","original_name":"Andrew Duff","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56b4729fc3a36806ea004406","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1572872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Weiss","original_name":"Steve Weiss","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56b472cfc3a36806ea004412","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1552509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Hone","original_name":"Richard Hone","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56b473d09251415320002e8e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1550101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Saunders","original_name":"Tim Saunders","popularity":0.1265,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56b473e992514114eb0042e1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1552508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Dormer","original_name":"Tom Dormer","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56b473fc9251415320002e97","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":4063,"name":"siege"},{"id":4595,"name":"us army"},{"id":222687,"name":"german army"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
