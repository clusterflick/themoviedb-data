Once war became imminent, Joseph Goebbels instructed the German film industry to initiate production of numerous militaristic projects, but DIII88 was initiated by the Propaganda Minister's rival, Goring, who commissioned several aviation pictures. DIII88 is not a war picture per se, because it takes place in peacetime, but the young, fresh-faced air aces enthusiastically look forward to the coming war. The propaganda is blatant: The only thing that matters is dedication to duty and unconditional commitment to the Fatherland.","popularity":0.2793,"poster_path":"/aSLJH6mQEFvJjoAtoJUWgnjeGEc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7448,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tobis Filmkunst","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1939-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"D III 88","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"D III 88: The New German Air Force Attacks","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1339527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Kayßler","original_name":"Christian Kayßler","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":"/nYRikUt0saEsGzDTFKHzAZkp3Vg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Oberleutnant Mithoff","credit_id":"56b6c63dc3a36806ee00b48c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Otto Wernicke","original_name":"Otto Wernicke","popularity":0.2057,"profile_path":"/xHWKwyOG7JyqUDoKQmbOnk5wJB5.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Oberwerkmeister Bonicke","credit_id":"56b6c64dc3a36848160052ed","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1340220,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinz Welzel","original_name":"Heinz Welzel","popularity":0.0932,"profile_path":"/oomkbYbSovEYBwsSC2UA2QoaMFT.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Obergefreiter Fritz Paulsen","credit_id":"56b6c6839251414c45005261","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1573822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hermann Braun","original_name":"Hermann Braun","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Obergefreiter Robert Eckhard","credit_id":"56b6c6f6c3a36806ee00b4a3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36351,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinz Engelmann","original_name":"Heinz Engelmann","popularity":0.2,"profile_path":"/vSWtdfsAIiyvpNCTAFGNzoXNnyK.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Leutnant Frank","credit_id":"572205e292514149f30002ae","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Bildt","original_name":"Paul Bildt","popularity":0.1331,"profile_path":"/oiYGNyzxYJoPcEAH6AjCowrtoPl.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Stabsarzt der Flugstaffel","credit_id":"572205f3c3a3685fba0007a5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":46848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carsta Löck","original_name":"Carsta Löck","popularity":0.1504,"profile_path":"/jhBUeOC5z88QugMmEyrAlFhFKoA.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Lina","credit_id":"5722060892514130df000510","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Gross","original_name":"Walter Gross","popularity":0.1424,"profile_path":"/4mtIPs5ZFxmeIDvjEEhM29pQcSB.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Funker","credit_id":"57220630c3a3685ff1000611","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolf Fischer","original_name":"Adolf Fischer","popularity":0.0991,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Gefreiter Zeissler","credit_id":"5870aae6925141355b005690","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1360878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Horst Birr","original_name":"Horst Birr","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":"/2PStiDI8Zvcnfi9aS29JVlTu4b1.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Monteur Hasinger","credit_id":"5870aaf6c3a3684f23006387","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Martell","original_name":"Karl Martell","popularity":0.0809,"profile_path":"/3uJxoIrIAMYAv5xM8nXOVWipL27.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Lt.
