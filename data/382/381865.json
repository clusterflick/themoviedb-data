But one day it becomes clear that he’s not going to be coming home anymore. From that day their mutual lives begin. While he is actually smarter and stronger than his simian companion, Popi capitulates to every one of Huhuu’s whims in a show of obedience and subservience. Huhuu meanwhile becomes a symbol of licentiousness and tomfoolery. The film is based on the short story \"Popi and Huhuu\" by Estonian author Friedebert Tuglas.","popularity":0.3615,"poster_path":"/u9tzB4eJaqwhqb4rp5Bub8pmDT0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":69851,"logo_path":"/eRkN7XGL7KmMYe8vUmtTuM4oSLP.png","name":"Nukufilm","origin_country":"EE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2015-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Master","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2576596,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrus Raudsalu","original_name":"Andrus Raudsalu","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63447bb9cf62cd007ead90ef","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2246355,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kerdi Oengo","original_name":"Kerdi Oengo","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":"/wDCFkOSIsPOHc3Bt9j2eJ2yxUKi.jpg","credit_id":"63447bc79c97bd00903b314b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1940281,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andres Tenusaar","original_name":"Andres Tenusaar","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63447becf3b49a0079d4f65e","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3223150,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Märt Kivi","original_name":"Märt Kivi","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63447bf7d6c300007f5f15d5","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1456097,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Horret Kuus","original_name":"Horret Kuus","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/f3uCg7h1BwTQM6QLwUvdoS2aCO3.jpg","credit_id":"63447c04cffeed007c7872d2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1273975,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ragnar Neljandi","original_name":"Ragnar Neljandi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/9Mv7BiVLDQNvPszVde9FMjWh3qw.jpg","credit_id":"63447c137a97ab007d5674a4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584884,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Riho Unt","original_name":"Riho Unt","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":"/5k0OHGFeqiZN2hH3aMTJSs0lbYB.jpg","credit_id":"63447c1eb7a1540090c3c950","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584884,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Riho Unt","original_name":"Riho Unt","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":"/5k0OHGFeqiZN2hH3aMTJSs0lbYB.jpg","credit_id":"56b9c4fac3a3681e5d0020d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1206331,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lepo Sumera","original_name":"Lepo Sumera","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/4Z9uaJpIvZET4eVjKSyYvlCaykK.jpg","credit_id":"63ce4385e16e5a02cd5a3caa","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20230,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Arvo Pärt","original_name":"Arvo Pärt","popularity":0.1895,"profile_path":"/bq7OliFL8gf9ERIck9jhPivfv7z.jpg","credit_id":"63ce438d63536a009f8d9ba3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1273975,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ragnar Neljandi","original_name":"Ragnar Neljandi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/9Mv7BiVLDQNvPszVde9FMjWh3qw.jpg","credit_id":"64463b177648410840bf4cb6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584884,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Riho Unt","original_name":"Riho Unt","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":"/5k0OHGFeqiZN2hH3aMTJSs0lbYB.jpg","credit_id":"5f6ee2acfbe36f00385bfddf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2792192,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Friedebert Tuglas","original_name":"Friedebert Tuglas","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/aDIRYvModks6RDqMkWhbFFT9flW.jpg","credit_id":"673adb31f741eb0428b621ce","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6038908","wikidata_id":"Q20202284","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u9tzB4eJaqwhqb4rp5Bub8pmDT0.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":533},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sfcqshMhRogeQV9cCZTCLNnNsQK.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Master by Riho Unt -
