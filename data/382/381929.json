I am.” “The Bad Boy of Bowling,” directed by Bryan Storkel, explores the meaning of that schizophrenic shout, uttered for a national television audience right after he won an unprecedented fifth U.S. Open title. He’s the one-time wunderkind son of Dick Weber, the matinee idol of bowling in its heyday. He’s the mullet-wearing PDW who gave much-needed energy to a dying sport with his “crotch shots.” He’s a wise guy who has wised up—at least a little. In this entertaining but piercing roll down memory lane, viewers will discover just who Pete Weber really is.","popularity":0.081,"poster_path":"/rY9CPwJGLULD5pKnJROZCAGQz13.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":116538,"logo_path":"/n5d2MXzCcyG0FSbfQClp6fVrDJV.png","name":"Sidestilt Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bad Boy of Bowling","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":939400,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bryan Storkel","original_name":"Bryan Storkel","popularity":0.1497,"profile_path":"/1lAOsJAnn47CNZjN0fyh1lYWE8R.jpg","credit_id":"56ba5b03c3a3687ca6000a76","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5535950","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/grlC0yChx342pEpPBHCTRpkNXmn.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tRjWduHvoykDLM9MQrd4DQC71Xp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vtpgL3OOVSZSuKkblW1ueGclgeQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rY9CPwJGLULD5pKnJROZCAGQz13.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":730}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
