They along with other African-Americans, fought for American independence, the abolition of slavery, civil and equal rights. They served their country during wartime and helped rebuild the Souths economy after the Civil War. One even became the first African American to sit on the Supreme Court. Many spoke out for the causes they believed in and many died fighting for these causes. Their place in American history must not be underestimated or forgotten. Their contributions can still be seen and felt today.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just the Facts: Historical Icons: Famous African Americans","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
