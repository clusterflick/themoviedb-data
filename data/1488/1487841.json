Civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks is remembered as a courageous woman whose defiance in the face of segregation helped inspire the architects of the civil rights movement and set an example for generations to follow. She saw the inherent evil in segregation and she had the courage to fight it in its common place, a seat on a bus.
