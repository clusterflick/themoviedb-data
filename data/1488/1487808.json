This documentary, packed with eyewitness accounts and archive footage, looks back at his brief career as an actor, his stormy relationship with the Nouvelle Vague and his uncompromising work as a filmmaker. Above all, it paints the portrait of a man with an irreducible character who claims to have always hated adults and their cynicism, ever since his damaged childhood.","popularity":0.1286,"poster_path":"/88XA5jKpTdXmFTqJyxg7Ppxtkv2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16180,"logo_path":"/tE5t6MnMhvyc34beR4Qf6hM2c5K.png","name":"INA","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gérard Blain : adultes, je vous hais","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gérard Blain","original_name":"Gérard Blain","popularity":1.6556,"profile_path":"/pPYuPqx8NrieLkNpZhUKej5s3tx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self (archives) - director, subject","credit_id":"683465e4dd07645cc0037759","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21678,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier Assayas","original_name":"Olivier Assayas","popularity":1.9592,"profile_path":"/yNhxilJd1QPGf1snqLtesAD7Z6M.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self - director, critique","credit_id":"683466cd49d299fbdd2b7aad","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2254506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Cieutat","original_name":"Michel Cieutat","popularity":0.3895,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self - actor","credit_id":"683466dc0889d3b4b7414519","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Blain","original_name":"Paul Blain","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"683466ef0889d3b4b741451d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":222686,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mia Hansen-Løve","original_name":"Mia Hansen-Løve","popularity":1.2394,"profile_path":"/m3FOY1ofVg2sg0H1lOWOcWKoRPC.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self - director","credit_id":"68346702f3c1664346414579","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2603328,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michel Marmin","original_name":"Michel Marmin","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6834670d94282ee2e4838208","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39191,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Emmanuel Machuel","original_name":"Emmanuel Machuel","popularity":0.2757,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self - director of photography","credit_id":"6834671c59374be94e03771e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Wayne","original_name":"John Wayne","popularity":6.3621,"profile_path":"/ggHZ8WTKaoD9bGRhmC1FlV9sXwL.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self (archive)","credit_id":"683467355ab3679e36b6b6d1","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4419752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier Payage","original_name":"Olivier Payage","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68346605a5f2332a3172ff10","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4419751,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Baptiste Delpias","original_name":"Jean-Baptiste Delpias","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6834660efca5da67032b74be","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4419751,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Baptiste Delpias","original_name":"Jean-Baptiste Delpias","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68346617a4f5e75043b6d164","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5463595,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gabriel Issartel","original_name":"Gabriel Issartel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6834663368a13bc0358380b9","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2953882,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gérald Collas","original_name":"Gérald Collas","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683466472d5d5fbcfb0555de","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15160950","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/88XA5jKpTdXmFTqJyxg7Ppxtkv2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"placeholder","release_date":"2019-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ciné+","release_date":"2025-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
