It's an “ideological and racial war”, says Adolf Hitler. Marshal Zhukov stopped the Germans at the gates of Moscow. But in July 1942, the Führer decided to head for the Caucasus, where there was oil. A modern industrial city, 80% of Stalingrad was raised to the ground in just a few days of bombing. But the Soviet Generalissimo and Chairman of the State Defense Committee, Stalin, decided not to evacuate the city. A single motto: “Not one more step backwards”.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stalingrad: Plus un pas en arrière","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5560530","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
