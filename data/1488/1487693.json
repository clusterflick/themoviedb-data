This film interprets the balance in two ways with the creatures in the ancient Chinese book called ‘The Classic of Mountains and Seas’. One is the dynamic equilibrium of the Five Elements in Taoism, namely Water, Wood, Fire, Earth, and Metal. The other are the three sets of balance between disease and health, war and peace, rationality and emotion (spirit and flesh).","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"People Mountain People Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5463169,"name":"Bolang Shui","original_name":"Bolang Shui","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683427f0eb4d6a8cf30373ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
