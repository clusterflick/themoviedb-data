With the help of a team of Lebanese volunteers, he runs a youth centre and gymnasium in Sydney's west. The Centre, which has no government funding, is struggling in the face of council planning regulations and funding shortfalls. Fadi sets out to solve all their problems with the help of three determined, but often argumentative, cohorts - Aliyah, Amna and Zouhour. First up, to raise funds he flies out former rap star turned born-again Muslim, Napoleon, to preach a message of non-violence to young Lebanese Australians. Next, he and his trusty team organise a youth conference to discuss the problems young Muslims face in Australia. Meanwhile the Council deadline is looming, with the threat of closure imminent.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/x70SvQVLblEJ5CNxxFRYpbcCblp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Temple of Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1348366,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Zubrycki","original_name":"Tom Zubrycki","popularity":0.2245,"profile_path":"/nPPW0pRmG7ryvsTW7Hsu324UiqE.jpg","credit_id":"68344b19a02850b1b6055535","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x70SvQVLblEJ5CNxxFRYpbcCblp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
