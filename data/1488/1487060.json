After a city tour, they set off by bus and then on foot with Sherpas to base camp. Having set out to attempt the Rupal Pillar, the expedition was unable to reach its objective in time (torrential rain, blocked roads, scree, etc.) and lost precious time before choosing to attempt the Mazeno Ridge by default. The team theoretically had the means to do so, since it brought together no fewer than 21 strong climbers, with a large core from Lyon—a concentration of talent rarely seen. But the resulting group dynamic worked contrary to expectations, and they had to settle for the most modest of consolation prizes: the ascent of the First Peak (6,880 meters). Frésafond recounted this in a book-testimony \"The Revenge of the Himalayas - The Human Adventure at Nanga-Parbat\".","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/zy0hNvwYqt2gVOP6QkVXayXksfF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":196912,"logo_path":"/nRtogyDc0ZaW7SHNxlXe0ZJO92l.png","name":"Club Alpin Français (CAF)","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ascension au Nanga-Parbat","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":486,"name":"himalaya mountain range"},{"id":220014,"name":"alpinism"},{"id":292290,"name":"nanga parbat"},{"id":299422,"name":"french climbers"},{"id":315591,"name":"french expedition"},{"id":346918,"name":"french alpinism"},{"id":349939,"name":"mountaineering documentary film"},{"id":352328,"name":"himalayism"},{"id":352544,"name":"pakistan summits"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
