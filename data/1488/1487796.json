Personalities as varied as psychologist Anne Ancelin Schützenberger, systemic therapist Bert Hellinger and artist Alexandro Jodorowsky have, each in their own way, revealed the existence of these unresolved stories that profoundly influence our lives. Today, epigenetic research confirms that trauma can mark our genome, and be passed on beyond those who experienced it. But how do these memories get inscribed in us? How can they be recognized, overcome and healed? Filmmaker Louis Mouchet shares his own journey through this deeply personal film. This process was nourished by : The making of and follow-up to the film La Constellation Jodorowsky, An introspective dive triggered by the death of his mother and the simultaneous birth of his first child, A powerful session with Romanian therapist Cristina Schmidt.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/61K9IZPGpZPq9g6RpUYqdJxqgNl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85567,"logo_path":null,"name":"Neovision","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2023-03-01","revenue":300000,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A journey towards reparation and peaceful transmission.","title":"What the Forest conceals","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55119,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alejandro Jodorowsky","original_name":"Alejandro Jodorowsky","popularity":1.4499,"profile_path":"/rNLy0GHNAdq4TpWOY0yVEnc1lyb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"self","credit_id":"68345a0380f9c90c3d0375fd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118135,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Mouchet","original_name":"Louis Mouchet","popularity":1.4203,"profile_path":"/gkmbEXbnqboNLXc9feNzH0FHpXa.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"self","credit_id":"68345a10a4f5e75043b6d11b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2262623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Delarive","original_name":"Patrick Delarive","popularity":0.3662,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68345a202efd43839f838209","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3843640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cristina Schmidt","original_name":"Cristina Schmidt","popularity":0.1531,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"68345a35604f44035672fe97","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3843641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony T Gaillard","original_name":"Tony T Gaillard","popularity":0.1535,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"68345a42226d8b2e862b7460","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2461084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ariane Giacobino","original_name":"Ariane Giacobino","popularity":0.1557,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"68345a5d61f1fefb8beb350c","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118135,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Mouchet","original_name":"Louis Mouchet","popularity":1.4203,"profile_path":"/gkmbEXbnqboNLXc9feNzH0FHpXa.jpg","credit_id":"68345a84a64da04346b6b955","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1740097,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dorothy Cox","original_name":"Dorothy Cox","popularity":0.1943,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68345a9fea961108ed055473","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37038990","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/61K9IZPGpZPq9g6RpUYqdJxqgNl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2117,"name":"subconsciousness"},{"id":3371,"name":"family history"},{"id":14742,"name":"psychic"},{"id":18054,"name":"self help guru"},{"id":176182,"name":"psycho"},{"id":195730,"name":"self-help"},{"id":216873,"name":"genealogy"},{"id":234868,"name":"subconscious"},{"id":245251,"name":"transmission"},{"id":269808,"name":"introspective"},{"id":305104,"name":"introspection"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"TP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bande annonce du film CE QUE CACHE LA  FORÊT","key":"788977566","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-01-13T19:16:52.000Z","id":"68345cb7881cc2c11e72fdfd"}]}}}
