Film critic and longtime CalArts professor Berenice Reynaud documented those rehearsals and used the footage in this rarely screened essay film, which had long been considered lost. Miraculously, Anthology has recently rediscovered the original 16mm elements and has digitally restored the film for this occasion. A truly exciting find that presents the only known footage of an important, albeit lost, Foreman work.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/AtzLgKEz0VsMFrRT9F4mmYRNm9D.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pavane For A Missing Play","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106587,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Foreman","original_name":"Richard Foreman","popularity":0.4882,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"683274a58f47ed8371b6af82","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3333796,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scotty Snyder","original_name":"Scotty Snyder","popularity":0.3462,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68327505990f489207a86676","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1894621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Manheim","original_name":"Kate Manheim","popularity":0.25,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6832751121a485fb6b036db2","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4019838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Berenice Reynaud","original_name":"Berenice Reynaud","popularity":0.1232,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683274b186aa54c7c0a8668d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1701,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AtzLgKEz0VsMFrRT9F4mmYRNm9D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1134}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
