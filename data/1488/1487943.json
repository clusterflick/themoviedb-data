Combining documentary footage with autofiction and elements of magical realism, this new film by Zeo Fawcett traces the fractured temporality of the medicalised trans body, where rumination, fatasising, and coping bleed together.  Developed through Zeo’s distinctive diaristic style — shaped by the raw, confessional language of online oversharing — the film refuses neat narratives of recovery or revelation. Instead, it sits with the rawness of being seen too much and not enough, within systems that obscure more than they reveal.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soft Exit Wound","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5464083,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zeo Fawcett","original_name":"Zeo Fawcett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6834a2615f647053e7055482","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5464083,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zeo Fawcett","original_name":"Zeo Fawcett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6834a23b2d5d5fbcfb055750","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
