Destitute, the troupe plans to return home when Mac, the stage doorman, offers to allow four of the men, Phil, Dandy, Jack and Ted, to use the theater for a boardinghouse. After accepting Mac's offer, the men improvise bedrooms out of the set pieces and meet amateur actress Lorie Fenton from Cleveland, who is eager to audition for them. When the men learn she recently received a small inheritance, they allow her to audition, hoping she will back the show.","popularity":0.8954,"poster_path":"/1MJ5A1XY8VjYnTklPDRQszvMP3l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1940-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"IT'S A MUSICAL METEOR!","title":"Dancing on a Dime","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Paige","original_name":"Robert Paige","popularity":0.2654,"profile_path":"/3ZwsxO24hm19O73gKIeJbYdbELJ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ted Brooks","credit_id":"52fe4f30c3a36847f82c418b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Lind Hayes","original_name":"Peter Lind Hayes","popularity":0.1459,"profile_path":"/cKqSRLnxga6bsVZzkic7ckhqp1d.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dandy Joslyn","credit_id":"52fe4f30c3a36847f82c418f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Quillan","original_name":"Eddie Quillan","popularity":0.3433,"profile_path":"/p49Q3UZigqHlmrQYWa2RTNh6CGv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jack Norcross","credit_id":"52fe4f30c3a36847f82c4193","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Jenks","original_name":"Frank Jenks","popularity":0.2326,"profile_path":"/8ieh8cQUfXmK6W7vhn84wOPC5AC.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Phil Miller","credit_id":"52fe4f30c3a36847f82c4197","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":135354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace McDonald","original_name":"Grace McDonald","popularity":0.1188,"profile_path":"/t22ekuGBC6BSqSqRq7VYZ1nPBul.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lorie Fenton","credit_id":"52fe4f30c3a36847f82c419b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":131001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Dale","original_name":"Virginia Dale","popularity":0.119,"profile_path":"/h2Py6AD7EEWukFTAVYsax9ljwX7.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dolly Stewart","credit_id":"52fe4f30c3a36847f82c419f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":121236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carol Adams","original_name":"Carol Adams","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/963tesm7br5NXes6wzT3Qc41H1o.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Polly Adams","credit_id":"52fe4f30c3a36847f82c41a3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1092718,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Cornell","original_name":"Lillian Cornell","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/evoRv6FN7Tyh9hx8hrDI7yxMYww.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Doris Marlowe","credit_id":"52fe4f30c3a36847f82c41a7","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Frawley","original_name":"William Frawley","popularity":0.2117,"profile_path":"/mPCnAsN2GbBoLl34nrviZ4aCCe1.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mac","credit_id":"52fe4f30c3a36847f82c41ab","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Lane","original_name":"Charles Lane","popularity":0.5535,"profile_path":"/ghyuQ8HoIY1ozRzbLGJNl2d1dz6.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Freeman Taylor","credit_id":"52fe4f30c3a36847f82c41af","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wanda McKay","original_name":"Wanda McKay","popularity":0.2278,"profile_path":"/ifZpy75FH8o0o1paoVAukStI5xu.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Lulu","credit_id":"52fe4f30c3a36847f82c41b3","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Aylesworth","original_name":"Arthur Aylesworth","popularity":0.1794,"profile_path":"/n2c5xm6DKwvdqhCkcVrEB0yCCn8.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Joe Phillips","credit_id":"52fe4f30c3a36847f82c41b7","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130087,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Santley","original_name":"Joseph Santley","popularity":0.1415,"profile_path":"/xbh7KVy3Fqe6gEDg5WaXtLVxGOX.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4f30c3a36847f82c41bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86405,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Allen Rivkin","original_name":"Allen Rivkin","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4f30c3a36847f82c41c9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":938322,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maurice Rapf","original_name":"Maurice Rapf","popularity":0.2581,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4f30c3a36847f82c41cf","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1038747,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"A.M.
