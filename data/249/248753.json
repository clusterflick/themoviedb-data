Flattered, Catherine moves into Gordi's villa near Cannes, escorted by her entire family. Only Jacques Merval, Gordi's secretary, disagrees. This is understandable, as it is he who writes the plays that Gordi, rather tired, simply signs. Jacques is a one-man band in every sense of the word, allying himself with the Casino manager to bring Catherine back to her music-hall successes. Despite a few clouds, and thanks to Gordi's generous intervention, he succeeds. Wasn't his only thought the happiness of the woman he loves?","popularity":0.2616,"poster_path":"/wWywzpKW2LnoFT8NyeiLjHj7K55.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":643,"logo_path":null,"name":"Société
