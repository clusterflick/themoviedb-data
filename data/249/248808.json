While only 1% of Americans has served in the military, former service members account for 20% of all suicides in the U.S. Based in Canandaigua, NY and open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, the Veterans Crisis Line receives more than 22,000 calls each month from veterans of all conflicts who are struggling or contemplating suicide. This timely documentary spotlights the traumas endured by America’s veterans, as seen through the work of the hotline’s trained responders. CRISIS HOTLINE captures extremely private moments, where the professionals, many of whom are themselves veterans or veterans’ spouses, can often interrupt the thoughts and plans of suicidal callers to steer them out of crisis.","popularity":0.1579,"poster_path":"/6Q0smimpcOXbCZSdRU00pCvDOID.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14914,"logo_path":"/1RZBWz53SpHUTLpRcM8BGv2plIP.png","name":"HBO Documentary Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crisis Hotline: Veterans Press 1","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":20,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":142404,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ellen Goosenberg Kent","original_name":"Ellen Goosenberg Kent","popularity":0.0786,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54b895eb92514148590008f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":116083,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dana Heinz Perry","original_name":"Dana Heinz Perry","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/j3BS27pDhP5JkIoq9Rm3PKIC7zy.jpg","credit_id":"5d75acd42ea6b90012c072bf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3449252","wikidata_id":"Q18787624","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cm2tRTAu1096ur16ZVahGQzqqtR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1763,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6Q0smimpcOXbCZSdRU00pCvDOID.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1175},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fU0oZb63zGIvcKeJjbp9edxh4fK.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1543,"name":"war veteran"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"16","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Fall Documentary Series: Crisis Hotline: Veterans Press (HBO Documentary Films)","key":"Ns5ua_t5Lm8","published_at":"2013-11-07T16:35:16.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"533ec727c3a368544800baaf"}]}}}
