When the Japanese discover the affair, they try to force Tokoramo to end it, but Helene refuses to stop visiting him. One night, during one of her visits, Bernisky comes to Tokoramo's apartment and, while Helene hides, rebukes her to her lover. After Bernisky leaves, Tokoramo orders Helene out, but when he realizes his love for her, he calls her back. Suddenly, she rejects and insults him to the point that he strangles her. Tokoramo wants to confess his crime, but he must complete his work, and so his countrymen sacrifice a boy, Hironari, who pleads guilty to the murder and eventually is guillotined. In the end, Tokoramo also dies and his colleagues burn his valuable papers in order to protect Japan. -From the TCM.com Database, powered by the AFI.","popularity":0.5189,"poster_path":"/at36TcjUMCiupKIu5n76eKiU9hT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50574,"logo_path":null,"name":"New York Motion Picture","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Typhoon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"L'Honneur japonais","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sessue Hayakawa","original_name":"Sessue Hayakawa","popularity":0.3328,"profile_path":"/juDoFtoIEMaKZMRL9Ipexkgqw81.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tokorama","credit_id":"52fe4f3ac3a36847f82c6d23","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gladys Brockwell","original_name":"Gladys Brockwell","popularity":0.1417,"profile_path":"/jpo2C8eHFUrb451hWnfaPGqq5jh.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Helene","credit_id":"52fe4f3ac3a36847f82c6d27","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Borzage","original_name":"Frank Borzage","popularity":0.2085,"profile_path":"/ban01OL4OFBDHsWkq4lEPWEtzbi.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Renard Bernisky","credit_id":"52fe4f3ac3a36847f82c6d2b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1588555,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Henry Kotani","original_name":"Henry Kotani","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/qGT9lttP0cH9ZvUsH4l4BJChFzF.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Hironari","credit_id":"575cc618c3a36810a400291f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1375574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leona Hutton","original_name":"Leona Hutton","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Theresa","credit_id":"575cc61f9251412b0c001000","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1334813,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kisaburō Kurihara","original_name":"Kisaburō Kurihara","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/8U3DLVPmUh6gDNPo8t6AbPeVpny.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Baron Joshikawa (as Thomas Kurihara)","credit_id":"5e61b31b459ad6001853fc8d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1077394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tsuru Aoki","original_name":"Tsuru Aoki","popularity":0.1145,"profile_path":"/zvAnDdUadlyszWc37a9RkazgluL.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"575cc62cc3a368378f000b3d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":132322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles K.
