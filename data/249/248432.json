As with earlier British Transport Films, many of the personnel, scientists, engineers, crew and passengers were featured in the 20 minute film. It won several awards, including the Technical & Industrial Information section of the Festival for Films for Television in 1961. The film is also particularly noted for its score, by Clifton Parker, which, unlike the earlier Elizabethan Express is uninterrupted by any commentary.","popularity":0.1375,"poster_path":"/5TVzKFNKA8o4VFGIOs9LFl1bpyp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52835,"logo_path":null,"name":"British Transport Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1960-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blue Pullman","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145375,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Ritchie","original_name":"James Ritchie","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4f32c3a36847f82c4b61","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145375,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Ritchie","original_name":"James Ritchie","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4f32c3a36847f82c4b67","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52219,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Clifton Parker","original_name":"Clifton Parker","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6330078d663b87007db070b9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086467,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Edgar Anstey","original_name":"Edgar Anstey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/eJdn6dkMbySMdMXfj2dMGAECgRH.jpg","credit_id":"558722509251416b00000ed4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1479943,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hugh Raggett","original_name":"Hugh Raggett","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"558721fa92514137bc006900","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0368609","wikidata_id":"Q4929645","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5TVzKFNKA8o4VFGIOs9LFl1bpyp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1960-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
