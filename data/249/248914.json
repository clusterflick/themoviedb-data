This is not an area of tension; nothing warlike happens here; all that comes from across the border over in the enemy land are radio waves carrying the speeches of its leader, Marehito played by Hideyo Amamoto (Yojimbo, Kamen Rider). The soldier's only duty is to monitor these speeches, and he is sick to the teeth of the dictator's raving.  In his quarters is a female android, a 'comfort woman' issued him by the government. He lives quietly with his green-eyed ILYA Type 6, and is responsible for his desert border area. That is the whole of this soldier's life.  One day a military official pays a call on his quarters. There has been a shuffle of personnel in the high echelons, and a slight change in policy has been made. The ILYA Type 6 is to be upgraded.","popularity":0.2092,"poster_path":"/gX6fGc7J5NiZJm5Uk86hABN3bBo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1995-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marehito","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1284201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tenkwaku Naniwa","original_name":"Tenkwaku Naniwa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Boundary Guard","credit_id":"52fe4f3ac3a36847f82c6d4d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1284202,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yumi Mitani","original_name":"三谷侑未","popularity":0.1105,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"ILYA Type 6","credit_id":"52fe4f3ac3a36847f82c6d51","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1134631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Koichiro Mitsuda","original_name":"Koichiro Mitsuda","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Official from Headquarters","credit_id":"52fe4f3ac3a36847f82c6d55","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227622,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hideyo Amamoto","original_name":"天本英世","popularity":0.6568,"profile_path":"/5hPGmYj0FEaFC8Dij7xpIcG6waT.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Voice of Marehito","credit_id":"52fe4f3ac3a36847f82c6d59","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1134628,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomoya Sato","original_name":"Tomoya Sato","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":"/q5dScvw6FbYOp8LZZUv3jApHMuu.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4f3ac3a36847f82c6d49","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3962964","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/31u9nucJfqYMcTq5ooAslBLopFw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1524,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yoAqBLNbap89TQCBoHklLnheTFp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1074},{"aspect_ratio":0.749,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gX6fGc7J5NiZJm5Uk86hABN3bBo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":562}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Marehito Trailer","key":"n8Nfm61-0KQ","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2007-07-04T03:52:11.000Z","id":"63bbac89aede5900949495ba"}]}}}
