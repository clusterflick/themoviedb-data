They look curious, as if wanting to test the quality of the tea leaves. Everywhere tourists take out their cameras ­ whether in front of large animals in the wild or camel riders, whether in the face of decorated human bodies or daily work routines. Now and again they look into the camera themselves. For later, for when they will proudly show their 'exotic' finds at home. This posing contains a model of western travels and picture making which is over a century old. The fascinated gaze on the foreigners fixes them in pre-formed frames. Lisl Ponger follows the trail of that gaze by taking amateur found footage material and linking it together in new ways.","popularity":0.3242,"poster_path":"/aGJrgMmmwXof0gBVebaUmLKAjjW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19327,"logo_path":null,"name":"Polyfilm Verleih","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Déjà vu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1284161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pemba Doma Sherpa","original_name":"Pemba Doma Sherpa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4f39c3a36847f82c68c5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1284162,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karim Duarte","original_name":"Karim Duarte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4f39c3a36847f82c68c9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1284163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renee Gadsen","original_name":"Renee Gadsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4f39c3a36847f82c68cd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1284164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mahmoud Lamine","original_name":"Mahmoud Lamine","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4f39c3a36847f82c68d1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1284165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anre Mawazo-Mukalay","original_name":"Anre Mawazo-Mukalay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4f39c3a36847f82c68d5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1284166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shaheen Merali","original_name":"Shaheen Merali","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4f39c3a36847f82c68d9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1284167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexia Pichler","original_name":"Alexia Pichler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4f39c3a36847f82c68dd","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1284168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Schey","original_name":"Ana Schey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4f39c3a36847f82c68e1","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1192242,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisl Ponger","original_name":"Lisl Ponger","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4f39c3a36847f82c68b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71593,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dietmar Schipek","original_name":"Dietmar Schipek","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4f39c3a36847f82c68c1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1192242,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisl Ponger","original_name":"Lisl Ponger","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4f39c3a36847f82c68bb","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0167129","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aGJrgMmmwXof0gBVebaUmLKAjjW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2398,"name":"narration"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
