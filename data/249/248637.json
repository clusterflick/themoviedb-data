In the winter of 2012 a community theatre in Birmingham, Alabama mounted an original musical, 'Skanks in a One Horse Town.' 'Skanks' follows the actors and creators from rehearsal through performance and after, at work, at their homes, and with their families.

city.","popularity":0.1377,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":28125,"logo_path":"/rdm3w7YxbkKlYgK8kGVsNRiOMZo.png","name":"Swiss Petite
