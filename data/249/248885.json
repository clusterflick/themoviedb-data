For the first time on television, Mafia turncoats give personal accounts of life inside the Mob. In this shocking documentary, five high-ranking informants tell tales of murder, brutality, greed and vanity--and why they broke the Sicilian code of honor.  The first generation of the American Mafia stood on the foundation of loyalty and a code of silence. The second and third generations traded their Sicilian traditions for government protection and instant personal gain.  MOB STORIES presents five chilling narratives from five members of the underworld, most of whom are overwhelmed with fear and paranoia with the exception of “Fat Jackie”, a loyal lifelong mobster. Father and son team, Alan and Marc Levin, direct and produce an honest and personal portrayal of the demise of the Mafia.","popularity":0.4854,"poster_path":"/995cqpD3XO4wzbPC76CGlu02aHl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mob Stories","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82286,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc Levin","original_name":"Marc Levin","popularity":0.1575,"profile_path":"/mlqZhmWcZ403kyvTgKdLDCMMaj2.jpg","credit_id":"53c02d96c3a3684ce90054da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":33678,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Maryse Alberti","original_name":"Maryse Alberti","popularity":0.1849,"profile_path":"/7pVhst4mBRHDcFytmKZECsVijMR.jpg","credit_id":"53c02f66c3a3684cf900535a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82286,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc Levin","original_name":"Marc Levin","popularity":0.1575,"profile_path":"/mlqZhmWcZ403kyvTgKdLDCMMaj2.jpg","credit_id":"53c02f28c3a3684cf4005243","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1238136,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sheila Nevins","original_name":"Sheila Nevins","popularity":0.0954,"profile_path":"/a9QK5bZlNB0zx2RTROOixTA3o5d.jpg","credit_id":"53c02f52c3a3684cdf005349","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1340598,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Al Levin","original_name":"Al Levin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53c02f1bc3a3684cdf005342","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":84389,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daphne Pinkerson","original_name":"Daphne Pinkerson","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/c4zJ7i3Sfs9LyA0qpWEmmuDS10.jpg","credit_id":"53c02f42c3a3684cec005429","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1340598,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Al Levin","original_name":"Al Levin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53c02f73c3a3684cdb005aad","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116086,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Geof Bartz","original_name":"Geof Bartz","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":"/dPUh9PvI6HKGMOblLl40uhdjech.jpg","credit_id":"53c02f81c3a3684cf9005360","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0259438","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9c4lWRqAHG94XRTFQY3350oRhZ7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/995cqpD3XO4wzbPC76CGlu02aHl.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2151,"name":"drug crime"},{"id":700,"name":"italian american"},{"id":924,"name":"italian"},{"id":3149,"name":"gangster"},{"id":1812,"name":"fbi"},{"id":2340,"name":"paranoia"},{"id":2987,"name":"gang war"},{"id":6220,"name":"mafia boss"},{"id":9826,"name":"murder"},{"id":10291,"name":"organized crime"},{"id":10391,"name":"mafia"},{"id":11734,"name":"police corruption"},{"id":14639,"name":"thug"},{"id":14856,"name":"informant"},{"id":15011,"name":"criminal underworld"},{"id":15405,"name":"godfather"},{"id":18103,"name":"code of honor"},{"id":33421,"name":"crime family"},{"id":163081,"name":"law enforcement"},{"id":165038,"name":"wiretapping"},{"id":166571,"name":"hired killer"},{"id":202093,"name":"retaliation"},{"id":203996,"name":"turncoat"},{"id":254343,"name":"mob enforcer"},{"id":259441,"name":"snitch"},{"id":308168,"name":"capo"},{"id":308169,"name":"self-preservation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
