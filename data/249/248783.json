Deanimated is literally displaced from the theater environment typical of film spectatorship, slightly blurring the boundaries between the spaces of projection and reception.  \"Deanimated: The Invisible Ghost,\" is based on the 1941 horror film \"The Invisible Ghost\" with the lead actors Bela Lugosi, Polly Ann Young, and John McGuire. In \"Deanimated\" the actors are gradually eliminated and thus the narrative loses its coherence. What remains are backgrounds, erratic camera movements that seem to move without focus throughout the room, capturing ghostly changes in light and shadows.  In this project, Arnold asks fundamental philosophical questions about human existence and presence in absence. Although the actors are missing, they leave behind traces (such as smashing bullets together, dust stirring up â€¦) and are experienced precisely in their absence as a ghostly, unreal present.","popularity":0.0289,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deanimated: The Invisible Ghost","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":998590,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Arnold","original_name":"Martin Arnold","popularity":0.0863,"profile_path":"/DerL8FUGOvBUi8h6b4KyM7tPJr.jpg","credit_id":"5a98d059c3a3680beb002c96","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0388875","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
