Now Sgt. Robynn Murray comes home from Iraq, to face a new kind of battle she never anticipated. Her tough-as-nails exterior begins to crack, leaving Robynn struggling with the debilitating effects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Shot and directed by first-time filmmaker Sara Nesson, POSTER GIRL is an emotionally raw documentary that follows Robynn over the course of two years as she embarks on a journey of self-discovery and redemption, using art and poetry to redefine her life.","popularity":0.2897,"poster_path":"/kDBT6GrxNwx2YSNJjyjkvXYIamb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Portayal Films, Inc","origin_country":""},{"id":11719,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sara Nesson Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Documentary short","title":"Poster Girl","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Garota do Pôster","type":"Documentario"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1123047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robynn Murray","original_name":"Robynn Murray","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Robynn Murray","credit_id":"52fe48509251416c91087f3b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1024098,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sara Nesson","original_name":"Sara Nesson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48509251416c91087f1f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935151,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mitchell Block","original_name":"Mitchell Block","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/sBTGqI3I4BRJ6HIb3kdpjUXp57V.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48509251416c91087f25","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1024098,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sara Nesson","original_name":"Sara Nesson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48509251416c91087f37","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1024098,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sara Nesson","original_name":"Sara Nesson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48509251416c91087f19","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116086,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Geof Bartz","original_name":"Geof Bartz","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":"/dPUh9PvI6HKGMOblLl40uhdjech.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48509251416c91087f2b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":934897,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Miriam Cutler","original_name":"Miriam Cutler","popularity":0.0882,"profile_path":"/8wBHwtn6IIU6jwRoZ6lGEBiHGPu.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48509251416c91087f31","department":"Sound","job":"Music Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1505384","wikidata_id":"Q2757652","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/vf7zanWIEz3SNM40o61FCf4O7sz.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hu01QRu6jGFAUCAUqcEGzuVRLB5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l80Fl6lFcNG2LY2Bn1uIG6eCTpN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":1135,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kDBT6GrxNwx2YSNJjyjkvXYIamb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yTobZ6Xo5VT0InHylL8P4vbPISf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kCL3minx1y8f4i2n0XUoqM2QjFN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/jEtNPWo2gxvnz7av6ep1lANn5PE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":8159,"name":"iraq war veteran"},{"id":162735,"name":"disability"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"POSTER GIRL Movie Trailer","key":"VJUhswSgWRw","published_at":"2012-08-13T20:28:38.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6cec3a36854480076a0"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"HBO Documentary Films: Poster Girl Trailer","key":"KJqfp76hOaA","published_at":"2011-11-08T21:44:05.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"533ec6cec3a36854480076a1"}]}}}
