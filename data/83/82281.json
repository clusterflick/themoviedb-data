After six full-length (and sold out!) HMH performances of \"The Do You Still Fucked Tour\" with De Lullo's April last year, is now the turn of Edgar, Jos and Storm to make their appearance in a real Debtors / Creditors Musical. This DVD will report on the seven special performances. The characters can escape from their office life and with other types Jiskefet immerse themselves in a Van den Ende world. What the men do exactly, we can not tell yet, but it's at least as hilarious as Lullo's tour will be sure.
