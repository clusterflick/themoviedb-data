In my opinion a brilliant come-back for Howerd, with a new cast, and funny script. This could have seen a good return as a series on ITV, although Howerds own death in 1992 limited this. The cast in this one-off feature some regulars from other sitcoms from the 1970's including Roy Evans who now stars in Eastenders. The set was more like a theatre than a TV set, no reality at all which, was actually quite a good move. In summing up they successfully bought a true classic back to life with Further Up Pompeii. It's well worth watching at least 2.","popularity":0.3382,"poster_path":"/26nK3MiAFseuessL3SpGMQLJtiT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6197,"logo_path":"/6LFn6YTFLtqNFkWw85csFErB2dv.png","name":"LWT","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Nay, Nay & Thice May!","title":"Further Up Pompeii!","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frankie Howerd","original_name":"Frankie Howerd","popularity":0.2335,"profile_path":"/ktt962fuiW9ZlXexk9V34qNci4q.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5bc7865f92514109f3003976","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":115284,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joanna Dickens","original_name":"Joanna Dickens","popularity":0.2848,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5bc7866a0e0a26362e004ad3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1225511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Anson","original_name":"Elizabeth Anson","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5bc786720e0a26362e004ae8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2153034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russell Gold","original_name":"Russell Gold","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5bc7868e92514109f6003e6c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1214095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Bardon","original_name":"John Bardon","popularity":0.1689,"profile_path":"/tZYUXogLmSjDFJ8BPTrA29NLc9e.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Villainus Brutus","credit_id":"5cd464d80e0a265e09614f90","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":965263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Hamilton","original_name":"Ian Hamilton","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc786cbc3a36829c200467a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0396606","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/26nK3MiAFseuessL3SpGMQLJtiT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
