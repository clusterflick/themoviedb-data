Up against much older students, these youngsters have committed the 600 pages of the Koran to memory, and will put their skills to the test before the elite of the world’s Muslim community in Cairo, Egypt. In the midst of this intense international competition, the three young competitors –two boys from Senegal and Tajikistan, and one girl from the Maldives – face uncertain futures at home, as they are caught between fundamentalist and moderate visions of Islam.  The children discuss their recitation techniques – with accompanying, completely improvised melodies – and talk about their nerves and excitement as they finally compete before a panel of judges.","popularity":0.389,"poster_path":"/n81MMUHdxYy8nNzlJZgCNNXUprH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14914,"logo_path":"/1RZBWz53SpHUTLpRcM8BGv2plIP.png","name":"HBO Documentary Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Koran by Heart","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":557265,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Grabias","original_name":"David Grabias","popularity":0.1117,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe484b9251416c9108726f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1069823,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Timothy Grucza","original_name":"Timothy Grucza","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe484b9251416c91087275","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":185678,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julie Goldman","original_name":"Julie Goldman","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/a0gcL0iZdVr8pOXsJBgGbYzp9Zu.jpg","credit_id":"52fe484b9251416c91087269","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122904,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Greg Barker","original_name":"Greg Barker","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":"/ea6KNaRpdIEtfpYfX32T46DQXtr.jpg","credit_id":"52fe484b9251416c9108725d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122904,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Greg Barker","original_name":"Greg Barker","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":"/ea6KNaRpdIEtfpYfX32T46DQXtr.jpg","credit_id":"52fe484b9251416c91087257","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1069824,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Frank-Peter Lehmann","original_name":"Frank-Peter Lehmann","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe484b9251416c9108727b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":967217,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Langdon Page","original_name":"Langdon Page","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe484b9251416c91087281","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1238136,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sheila Nevins","original_name":"Sheila Nevins","popularity":0.0954,"profile_path":"/a9QK5bZlNB0zx2RTROOixTA3o5d.jpg","credit_id":"52fe484b9251416c9108728d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222276,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Battsek","original_name":"John Battsek","popularity":0.0553,"profile_path":"/b1Y4pusdEfKqNkIDjDKtlADpdaY.jpg","credit_id":"52fe484b9251416c91087263","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1070135,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Steven Utt","original_name":"Steven Utt","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6009a061dd83fa003d8d7b75","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1766189","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/n81MMUHdxYy8nNzlJZgCNNXUprH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/iu94P7VvRs3M0GzkPGAM4RSO55B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1160,"name":"egypt"},{"id":789,"name":"muslim"},{"id":271,"name":"competition"},{"id":2392,"name":"koran"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Koran by Heart - BIFF 2011 Official Selection (Trailer)","key":"kMAxnCEukns","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2011-08-23T16:22:02.000Z","id":"626b84b869d2800b08853165"}]}}}
