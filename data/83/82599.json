Farm Aid was founded in 1985 by Willie Nelson, John Mellencamp, and Neil Young to raise public awareness about the plight of the American family farmer and to provide assistance to those families whose livelihood depends on agriculture. In the past 16 years, Farm Aid has raised over $23 million. This concert captures the spirit of a historic 2001 event. Performed on September 29, 2001, in Noblesville, Indiana, this sold-out Farm Aid concert featured a star-studded lineup including founder Willie Nelson, Neil Young, John Mellencamp, and Farm Aid's newest board member, Dave Matthews. Also performing are Arlo Guthrie, the Doobie Brothers, and Martina McBride, all of whom gave memorable performances to demonstrate their commitment to America's family farmer.","popularity":0.7246,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":116750,"logo_path":null,"name":"FilmWorks Creative Services LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Farm Aid 2001 - A Concert For America","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willie Nelson","original_name":"Willie Nelson","popularity":0.4929,"profile_path":"/e5rXc3fn4v642bIDVFWUr6UlVM3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ca84ec30e0a264c8bf140ce","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Young","original_name":"Neil Young","popularity":0.4751,"profile_path":"/pAEPuSZTK29JAzRkz5W1Vb1dTAe.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ca84ed59251415654fd4d73","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1015204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pegi Young","original_name":"Pegi Young","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":"/l3f3L5sMr5hCumeJE1HmZuoq02V.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5ca84f72c3a3683f5a5ea72a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1384813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Astrid Young","original_name":"Astrid Young","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5ca84f890e0a264c8bf142b3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Mellencamp","original_name":"John Mellencamp","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/benGyYmlsf4wGJ1oPkb1ZDvFV2k.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ca84fa4925141566efd6454","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Matthews","original_name":"Dave Matthews","popularity":0.6508,"profile_path":"/q82TEC7urGrpbclBojWnlvazSDg.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ca84fbd0e0a264c71f16e22","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":158039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martina McBride","original_name":"Martina McBride","popularity":0.1999,"profile_path":"/a1YnStUvMSZH6q0R07odfLh6t0Q.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5ca85026c3a3683f545e90c2","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Simmons","original_name":"Patrick Simmons","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Himself - The Doobie Brothers","credit_id":"5ca8d01ec3a3683f4c5f55f1","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63789,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eric Parkinson","original_name":"Eric Parkinson","popularity":0.0805,"profile_path":"/rG26Xee49xMnC0jCorkTIygYbwj.jpg","credit_id":"5ca86de09251415657fd92a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2282346,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sam Barber","original_name":"Sam Barber","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca86e05c3a3683f545ec14c","department":"Production","job":"Supervising Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2282348,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Leslie Collins","original_name":"Leslie Collins","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca86e1fc3a3683f525ecce1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2282351,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nick Lowery","original_name":"Nick Lowery","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca86e3c0e0a264c88f18152","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2282352,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tania McKeown","original_name":"Tania McKeown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca86e56c3a3683f5a5ee1dd","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0298281","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":727,"name":"country music"},{"id":253363,"name":"farm aid"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
