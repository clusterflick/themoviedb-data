The city was awash with the trappings of America’s cultural revolution-the San Francisco State University campus flooded with cops in riot gear, the Haight filled with drifters and idealists, and, on the third floor of Arlyck’s building, a come-one-come-all crashpad apartment. It was from this top floor commune that the precocious 4-year-old Sean would occasionally wander downstairs to visit and talk-and one day Arlyck turned on his camera.  Sean’s casual commentary on everything from smoking pot to living with speed freaks was delivered in simple sincerity throughout the soon-to-be famous 15-minute film. This First Child of the notorious decade may have shaken the audience with his simple sentence- “Sure, I smoke pot”-but it was his barefoot impishness which would encapsulate the hope that lay in front of the nation: a promise of infinite possibility.","popularity":0.0531,"poster_path":"/eNq95OeRbVhqY9FT5JQECaQDI3w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116489,"logo_path":null,"name":"Timed Exposures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The more things change, the more we're not the same","title":"Following Sean","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ralph Arlyck","original_name":"Ralph Arlyck","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":"/wU5Ued2Dd3fUmdEsiMcdZY8s33B.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"52fe48529251416c910881b7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1276460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Farrell","original_name":"Sean Farrell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe48529251416c910881bb","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ralph Arlyck","original_name":"Ralph Arlyck","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":"/wU5Ued2Dd3fUmdEsiMcdZY8s33B.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48529251416c910881ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ralph Arlyck","original_name":"Ralph Arlyck","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":"/wU5Ued2Dd3fUmdEsiMcdZY8s33B.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48529251416c910881b3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0479916","wikidata_id":"Q1435557","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":1398,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eNq95OeRbVhqY9FT5JQECaQDI3w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":994}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ARTE","release_date":"2008-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
