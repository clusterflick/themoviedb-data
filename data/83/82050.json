In a lavishly decorated nightclub, couples dance the syncopated rhythms of Latin America: Rumba, Cucaracha, Tango, and also the Charleston, Foxtrot and Boston. Among beautiful women, local pimps and Mussolini's spies brush each other on the dance floor, and in the streets. A police inspector is charged with a difficult task, to clean-up the city streets - just when bodies start falling around, as the Mafia and the spies tend each other deadly traps.","popularity":0.3383,"poster_path":"/2tEuNeYIXhWz1CIU8CES6QddOYP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":582,"logo_path":"/bEORFnCh6xQ3oQuY6yX6mRRCLvW.png","name":"Hachette
