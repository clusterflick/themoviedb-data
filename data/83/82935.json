Taking the viewer through a golden SoCal haze of broken homes, abandoned swimming pools and stray glimpses of unusual beauty, Dragonslayer captures the life and times of Josh 'Skreech' Sandoval, a local skate legend and new father, as his endless summer finally collides with the future. Set to the alternately roaring and dreamy soundtrack of bands from the indie labels Mexican Summer and Kemado Records including Best Coast, Bipolar Bear, Children, Dungen, Eddy Current and the Suppression Ring, Golden Triangle, Jacuzzi Boys, Little Girls, Real Estate, The Soft Pack, Saviours, as well as DEATH and Thee Oh Sees. Dragonslayer is a punk-rock manifesto to youth, love and learning to survive after the decline of western civilization.","popularity":0.1763,"poster_path":"/niwJbncGCTuA0TWYDBXab9i0oEM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1422,"logo_path":"/rIB6DuimR1qgLE14cBwpMABC2xx.png","name":"Killer Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dragonslayer","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":928953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh 'Skreech' Sandoval","original_name":"Josh 'Skreech' Sandoval","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe487e9251416c9108e6c1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":928950,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tom Fanning","original_name":"Tom Fanning","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe487e9251416c9108e693","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":865656,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Eric Koretz","original_name":"Eric Koretz","popularity":0.0868,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe487e9251416c9108e6a5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":895202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tristan Patterson","original_name":"Tristan Patterson","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe487e9251416c9108e687","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2862,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christine Vachon","original_name":"Christine Vachon","popularity":0.6925,"profile_path":"/INKu6dXw0DwiUqsK6Gw64Ygefd.jpg","credit_id":"52fe487e9251416c9108e699","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":174187,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Baker","original_name":"John Baker","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe487e9251416c9108e68d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":836378,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"T.
