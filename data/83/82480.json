This film is of this category. It is the story of a jealous and protective mother who allows her son only home-made dolls to satisfy his sick fantasy. But as in all fairy stories, there comes a day when a real, warm girl enters the sheltered life of the son. His natural and innate thirsts for  oddities soon make him repeat on the girl what, until then, he has been doing with the dolls. The story then evolves into a fight of wills between the mother and the girl.","popularity":0.2562,"poster_path":"/xD1QqCv5FBcM7DvBDvU9uV4Rmu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12726,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alcinter","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1969-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Big Ceremonial","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Weird Weirdo","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"I megali teleti","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":102864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ginette Leclerc","original_name":"Ginette Leclerc","popularity":0.1557,"profile_path":"/dzvsT0sEWAe3hoaY1iR2DvDz294.jpg","cast_id":1001,"character":"La mère","credit_id":"52fe48569251416c91088b35","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":919016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Tureau","original_name":"Michel Tureau","popularity":1.533,"profile_path":"/rJ4lsS5oE55tnvyl7IhmlOiP5vs.jpg","cast_id":1002,"character":"Cavanosa","credit_id":"52fe48569251416c91088b39","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":922684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcella Saint-Amant","original_name":"Marcella Saint-Amant","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"Syl","credit_id":"52fe48569251416c91088b3d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":233493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fernando Arrabal","original_name":"Fernando Arrabal","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":"/duchIlZNQJUMT1HLKjqnAiv9X8D.jpg","cast_id":1004,"character":"Le vendeur de lingerie","credit_id":"557878e99251416c7c000188","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1508067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Daniel Ehrmann","original_name":"Jean-Daniel Ehrmann","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1006,"character":"L'amant de Syl","credit_id":"55f1f697c3a3682303002ab1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Lumont","original_name":"Roger Lumont","popularity":0.1058,"profile_path":"/ziJQtP0tYua77eJdLRfoJ2lPPiB.jpg","cast_id":1007,"character":"L'homme du train","credit_id":"55f1f6989251416705002a2e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1508068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-France Le Signe","original_name":"Marie-France Le Signe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1008,"character":"","credit_id":"55f1f6989251414530001446","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1508069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chantal Torres","original_name":"Chantal Torres","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1009,"character":"","credit_id":"55f1f6989251416707002a4e","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928063,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre-Alain Jolivet","original_name":"Pierre-Alain Jolivet","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48569251416c91088b31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":233493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fernando Arrabal","original_name":"Fernando Arrabal","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":"/duchIlZNQJUMT1HLKjqnAiv9X8D.jpg","credit_id":"5578790b9251416c7c00018b","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1182594,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Serge Gance","original_name":"Serge Gance","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661d5d4a6d1bb20149383150","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928063,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre-Alain Jolivet","original_name":"Pierre-Alain Jolivet","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661d5d52db8a0001697e4b19","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0063029","wikidata_id":"Q1804086","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/xD1QqCv5FBcM7DvBDvU9uV4Rmu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
