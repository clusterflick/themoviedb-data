Thompson at work writing, editing, and recounting the creation of classics like Hells Angels and Fear &amp; Loathing in Las Vegas. Animals, whores &amp; dialogue were metaphors and an element Hunter almost always wove into his writing, and the words were emblazoned on his typewriter.","popularity":0.3608,"poster_path":"/lwDCb4TVCqu3jYgwEWffPLaMnBw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Animals, Whores & Dialogue: Breakfast with Hunter Vol. 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hunter S.
