He discusses the Pop Art movement, a bit, mostly how he was one of a number of artists making art that was then called Pop Art. Also interesting is Lichtenstein tells what different art critics have said about different phases of his art and he shares his personal reactions to their statements. Additionally some footage of people criticizing and discussing his artwork is included, almost in a “he said, she said” manner which makes the viewer think about how sometimes what others say about an artist’s work may be a bit off or just wrong. Contrary to what non-artists may think, artists do usually have a reason or an inspiration behind what they create. Lucky for us this documentary allows us into the brilliant mind of Roy Lichtenstein.","popularity":0.1855,"poster_path":"/9RoK4wXiHiVDkokKDOrBSsQSAFW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roy Lichtenstein","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2276312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Lichtenstein","original_name":"Roy Lichtenstein","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":"/kJscdRCdhdOaliQ1sdhze8TNy4d.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d7ec33a3c43440010a2636c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melvyn Bragg","original_name":"Melvyn Bragg","popularity":0.3052,"profile_path":"/fT3m5FRLXX5U2Y2olSeTKO0m9wR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d7ec346f0647c5e0a9c1fbe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":563667,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William Overgard","original_name":"William Overgard","popularity":0.0481,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d7ec3502866fa54b338c717","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Hunt","original_name":"Chris Hunt","popularity":0.0612,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e49c8d99b86160013626f63","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0298132","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nELvrNXLA5A1QgSbsYaBCznwfrk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iMm1BvJnQzUfLetmugFJPAIkvp0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eAwyNsUZbK6kHg46eYWc4zzDOsa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9RoK4wXiHiVDkokKDOrBSsQSAFW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
