Encountering an unknown planet (which turns out to be Earth), the Glegolith leader (Cyrillus) sends two \"manned\" probes to the surface to determine if it is suitable for colonisation.  The scouts in the probes think they have arrived at a great city, but in fact they have arrived at a new amusement park that is not yet open to the public. They proceed to explore four amusement rides.","popularity":0.2433,"poster_path":"/8dYJrU9bt8TOpPu4XsMSTnJi4Tr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-08-20","revenue":8959784,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alien Adventure","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":163896,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Boyle","original_name":"John Boyle","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"52fe484e9251416c91087883","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bouli Lanners","original_name":"Bouli Lanners","popularity":0.8133,"profile_path":"/z8rZxXU57hC66ixj28LO3cUCh2f.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"52fe484e9251416c91087887","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":772208,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pierre Lebecque","original_name":"Pierre Lebecque","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"52fe484e9251416c9108788b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3457015,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stephane Simal","original_name":"Stephane Simal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62269d90c5ada5001be00a5b","department":"Crew","job":"Technical Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76100,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Stassen","original_name":"Ben Stassen","popularity":0.1682,"profile_path":"/ltxLVxXWH0EvjbHpGMvwZ5bXu04.jpg","credit_id":"52fe484e9251416c9108787f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76100,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Stassen","original_name":"Ben Stassen","popularity":0.1682,"profile_path":"/ltxLVxXWH0EvjbHpGMvwZ5bXu04.jpg","credit_id":"52fe484e9251416c91087891","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0238829","wikidata_id":"Q2542515","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wcqF8UL0mxpsJit8iqpGlT83INg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1002,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8dYJrU9bt8TOpPu4XsMSTnJi4Tr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":705}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-08-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
