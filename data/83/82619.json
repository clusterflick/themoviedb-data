Things change drastically, however, when her plane crashes on a business trip. Along with two of her co-workers -the arrogant office crush Mark Taylor, and the office nobody Chris Russell - she finds herself stranded on an island. Now isolated from civilization, Megan embarks on a journey to discover what it really means to be rescued. \r That’s right: Island of Grace (Rescued 2008) has a twin!  All they had to do was change some of the evangelical themes to Mormon themes.  But also for some bizarre reason, they changed all the names of the cast members, even though they are the same people.  Apparently they thought that by changing the names, you would never know this was the same movie.","popularity":0.4543,"poster_path":"/3e4J8MLz7CofVy139KZMMtgqLiF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26589,"logo_path":null,"name":"WisenQuest","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Danger threatens them.
