Leung Sing-por as the wealth-feigning Au and Ma Si-tsang as penny pincher Ma already set the stage for laughter. Ma Si-tsang dons a hilarious moustache and adds panache to the character whenever he complacently twists his moustache, making his greediness almost lovable. The film features a zany plot 'twist' when the two Ma's, as father and son, try to attend a charity gala by having Sun Ma Si-tsang teach Ma Si-tsang to sing ‘Yu Hap-wan Expresses His Inner Feelings', one of the elder Ma's most popular repertoire. Ma Si-tsang gives a commanding seven-minute solo performance that captures the heart of the audience now and forever.","popularity":0.3989,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":144396,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ngai Sing","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1952-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"As You Desire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"When Wishes Come True","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1698793,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ma Sze-Tsang","original_name":"Ma Sze-Tsang","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5fbda76c54508d003ed4936c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1698165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sun-Ma Sze-Tsang","original_name":"Sun-Ma Sze-Tsang","popularity":0.1063,"profile_path":"/aQVTgxYdE0oZ1OVSJJohMRyIvRs.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5fbda779d9f4a600409a2d56","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2405231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leung Sing-por","original_name":"Leung Sing-por","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5fbda7887cffda004017f8e3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1346970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hung Sin-Nui","original_name":"Hung Sin-Nui","popularity":0.0372,"profile_path":"/dGcH8gIJHrhpN1sTL06JjRMulbM.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5fbda7939c97bd003d9f9bd2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1699204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tai Hau-Ho","original_name":"Tai Hau-Ho","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5fbda823323eba003ffc4d59","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1698150,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lam Kar-Yee","original_name":"Lam Kar-Yee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/fpz1OHWZimXRBDuhMrGhiFW3IFf.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5fbda82d9c97bd003e9f2885","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Pang-Fei","original_name":"Lee Pang-Fei","popularity":0.1556,"profile_path":"/anQskwwtirj1wUgYSIGn45GV76J.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5fbda83e7cffda004017f9f6","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1575169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Ngan","original_name":"Lee Ngan","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5fbda84b263462003c101c54","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1654995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ko Lo-Chuen","original_name":"Ko Lo-Chuen","popularity":0.1778,"profile_path":"/wzkaGQ9BFH3YILSeR9k7ygSR4Xe.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5fbda8564c1d9a003e81f946","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1699202,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chao Fei-Fei","original_name":"Chao Fei-Fei","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5fbda86257530e00423ab378","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1330219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yee Chau-Sui","original_name":"Yee Chau-Sui","popularity":0.1333,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"5fbda87054508d003ed495c7","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1698175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fung Ying-Seung","original_name":"Fung Ying-Seung","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"5fbda87ef9475b003fc46184","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1498671,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chu Kei","original_name":"Chu Kei","popularity":0.072,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbda7c47cffda004017f96e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2869207,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chan Cheuk-sang","original_name":"Chan Cheuk-sang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbda7e5323eba003efb8a87","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Cantonese\", \"english_name\"=>\"Cantonese\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"cn\", \"native_name\"=>\"Cantonese\"}","note":"","release_date":"1952-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
