It is a chronicle of the life of a nomadic artist, constrained to immobility. It is an attempt to leave traces on ports, enclaves, deltas, borders, transformed into places of desolation and detention. A refugee is a person who resists disappearance. Alpha explores the world through his art. It is a journey between two journeys, between two worlds. It is a journey to overcome. It's a journey to end the flight.","popularity":0.0694,"poster_path":"/gxXnAce6EcNDy4U4sYJJCpbNool.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2020-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Blue House","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2871432,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hamedine Kane","original_name":"Hamedine Kane","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc033dc54508d003fd82811","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13600510","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6vgqyT8ycvGWXiFus5IXBtXCYUd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1414,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/gxXnAce6EcNDy4U4sYJJCpbNool.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"IDFA","release_date":"2020-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
