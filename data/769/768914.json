The Marshall Plan enabled German volunteers to migrate to the Ruhr, find jobs, and receive training in mining. The new jobs improved the German economy and European industry as a whole, which also benefited from the new energy sources. The film describes advances in Great Britain and France that resulted from the Marshall Plan, and contrasts the Soviets' refusal to participate in similar programs.","popularity":0.0518,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1949-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Me and Mr. Marshall","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1029811,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stuart Schulberg","original_name":"Stuart Schulberg","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc01e9c489d000040ccee7a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32907818","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1949-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
