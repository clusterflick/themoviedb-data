The law restricts the citizens rights to share, save and use the information about people without their permission. Ukraine is on the road to European integration and adopting its laws and regulations. This street incident demonstrates the insecurity of Ukrainian citizens due to the lack of such rules. At the same time it provides an opportunity to comprehend filming/recording a person in public space. The film refers to Isaac Asimov's thoughts about whether humanoid robots will be friendly to others.","popularity":0.0781,"poster_path":"/nidMPdkYwRjwio7DVIXicnsmlgi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2019-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I, Robot","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2779118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roman Bordun","original_name":"Roman Bordun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbf6b289c97bd003ca14e90","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2779118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roman Bordun","original_name":"Roman Bordun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbf6cc09f51af003fe7307e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2779118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roman Bordun","original_name":"Roman Bordun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbf6cc654508d0040d6eea7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12882180","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.716,"height":1212,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nidMPdkYwRjwio7DVIXicnsmlgi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":868}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Ukrainian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Ukrainian\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"uk\", \"native_name\"=>\"Ukrainian\"}","note":"Kinooglyad CUK Festival","release_date":"2019-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
