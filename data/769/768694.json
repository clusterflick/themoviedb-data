Devon, a 22-year-old art school student, and Rachel, a 41-year-old architect, have created an escape from their everyday life where they can share unhurried flirtations about love, life and the shades in between. While their relationship only exists between docks on a boat ride - on this day we come to discover that their time together also has a number of predefined stops. When Devon wants to move their relationship to the next level, we quickly understand the different worlds they come from. Through a unique partnership, this film examines whether some types of love can only exist in finite spaces and time.","popularity":0.5858,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Knots","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandon Jay McLaren","original_name":"Brandon Jay McLaren","popularity":0.7223,"profile_path":"/jZKb3ziBI3r8I6Yd8m1zUWl2G4O.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Devon","credit_id":"5fbf5b8954508d003dd78691","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":21214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jill Teed","original_name":"Jill Teed","popularity":0.4825,"profile_path":"/pRu4qqDcb8ze3RKgoKxPwzW9SRP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Rachel","credit_id":"5fbf5b980c2710003e303e2d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2870514,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mieka Tennant","original_name":"Mieka Tennant","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbf5c91175051004112dce1","department":"Production","job":"Casting"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1100754,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeremy Power Regimbal","original_name":"Jeremy Power Regimbal","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/3tHTVAqHljHlpxATtMknwLASixI.jpg","credit_id":"5fbf5c7ff9475b0041c8190e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1100754,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeremy Power Regimbal","original_name":"Jeremy Power Regimbal","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/3tHTVAqHljHlpxATtMknwLASixI.jpg","credit_id":"5fbf5c056bdec3003c247b05","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandon Jay McLaren","original_name":"Brandon Jay McLaren","popularity":0.7223,"profile_path":"/jZKb3ziBI3r8I6Yd8m1zUWl2G4O.jpg","credit_id":"5fbf5be635c30a003f57d8e4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2870514,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mieka Tennant","original_name":"Mieka Tennant","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbf5c2e6bdec3003d25822c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2870515,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Miles Jay","original_name":"Miles Jay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbf5c684c1d9a003f84b573","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4416758,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Natalie Rae","original_name":"Natalie Rae","popularity":0.1616,"profile_path":"/5R1m60gLQJWw9V39s5JRa386MB.jpg","credit_id":"6715317ac6e304096196576e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4416758,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Natalie Rae","original_name":"Natalie Rae","popularity":0.1616,"profile_path":"/5R1m60gLQJWw9V39s5JRa386MB.jpg","credit_id":"6715317fc6e3040961965782","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4416758,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Natalie Rae","original_name":"Natalie Rae","popularity":0.1616,"profile_path":"/5R1m60gLQJWw9V39s5JRa386MB.jpg","credit_id":"6715318999f22f326aad99f4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2049582","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
