One of the companies accused of sparking the opioid epidemic was Purdue Pharma – wholly owned by the philanthropic Sackler family – who have made billions from the sale of the drugs. But where were the medical regulators and government agencies that should have prevented this crisis?  This is a compelling insight into the growth of America’s devastating relationship with opioids that has destroyed millions of lives.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Addicted: America's Opioid Crisis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":864,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eFxdFrNRKKssQe8V83w3QkaBadR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1536}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"BBC goes undercover inside America's heroin epidemic - BBC News","key":"SsYhC_OPwVU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2014-03-21T14:37:04.000Z","id":"61f9c3495f2db1001d6909bf"}]}}}
