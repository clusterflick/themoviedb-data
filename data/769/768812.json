Looking for a new habitat, the birds chose the flat pebbled roof of a concrete island – a printing house – in the middle of the city. The first generation of birds to grow up on this roof and fly to Southern Africa every winter have covered the distance from the Earth to the Moon.  During the film various human attitudes towards the terns will emerge. The attitude of the birds is clear – they view things form above.","popularity":0.2605,"poster_path":"/caCpSMv0rUmWDEdCdq6mzXXmMks.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":63249,"logo_path":null,"name":"VFS Films","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2001-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roof on the Moonway","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2856965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andis Mizišs","original_name":"Andis Mizišs","popularity":0.0764,"profile_path":"/cHuZN2avHrqZREouiy2cVPw4aGX.jpg","credit_id":"5fbfdd1335c30a004057cc21","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1297714,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Māris Maskalāns","original_name":"Māris Maskalāns","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/f6Rf1cWHHk7ZdeNs3KxRAXBIDXe.jpg","credit_id":"5fbfdd32323eba003efee9e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1297714,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Māris Maskalāns","original_name":"Māris Maskalāns","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/f6Rf1cWHHk7ZdeNs3KxRAXBIDXe.jpg","credit_id":"5fbfdd3f57530e00423e2fd0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1297714,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Māris Maskalāns","original_name":"Māris Maskalāns","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/f6Rf1cWHHk7ZdeNs3KxRAXBIDXe.jpg","credit_id":"5fbfdd4a6bdec3003b25a099","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2871101,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Arnis Mednis","original_name":"Arnis Mednis","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbfdd62ac8e6b003f33ae92","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297711,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anrijs Krenbergs","original_name":"Anrijs Krenbergs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbfdd79f9475b003fc78f84","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2851000,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Arvīds Ceļmalis","original_name":"Arvīds Ceļmalis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbfdd916bdec3003e2566cd","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2871102,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Raimonds Špakovskis","original_name":"Raimonds Špakovskis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbfdda554508d003fd7adfa","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1007606,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Uldis Cekulis","original_name":"Uldis Cekulis","popularity":0.0831,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbfddb96bdec3003d26292a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14064078","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"lv","file_path":"/caCpSMv0rUmWDEdCdq6mzXXmMks.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":698},{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":919,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xZM9Tp3REL02fcLYyLsZBzbwUSS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":614}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":240242,"name":"birds"},{"id":242436,"name":"urban nature"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
