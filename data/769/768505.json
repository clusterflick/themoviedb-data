MacArthur was a soldier's soldier: the son of an officer, the star of West Point, and the Army's youngest-ever full general. He was already a retired hero when he was recalled in 1941 to face his biggest challenge--defending an unprepared Pacific force against a seemingly unstoppably Japanese war machine. But everything about MacArthurâ€™s life was extraordinary; his army brat childhood to his rogue war in Korea, and his magnificent stand in the Philippines to his head-to-head confrontation with an angry Harry Truman. With rare footage and interviews with MacArthur's comrades, family, and friends, this compelling BIOGRAPHY program reveals the man who remains a hero to millions.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/99Nw5lHeFMmJJzyihLqT7x9j2cd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"General Douglas MacArthur Return of A Legend","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/99Nw5lHeFMmJJzyihLqT7x9j2cd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":529}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2006-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
