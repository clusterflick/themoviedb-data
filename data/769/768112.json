At the Polytechnic University, a group of students also takes a stand for freedom and democracy. Negotiations with the police are chaotic and aggressive, conducted via megaphones and politically charged music played over loudspeakers. The colorful umbrellas which the young people use to protect themselves against the brutal police actions emphasize the group’s bravado, which borders on recklessness.\r What begins as an energetic battle against the establishment turns into a lopsided game of cat and mouse when the police decide to surround the building. Within its red brick walls, the university building becomes a prison. Over the nearly two weeks that follow, as fear and exhaustion grow among the hundreds of students, so does the uncertainty. Should they hang on inside, or leave the building to face the armed police?","popularity":0.3866,"poster_path":"/4Ig5DRNR1IIgY2GjLdTEf4N7iRb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2020-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inside the Red Brick Wall","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"理大囲城","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3480369,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hong Kong Documentary Filmmakers","original_name":"Hong Kong Documentary Filmmakers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623ebf44d100b6005ca0b8ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14266320","wikidata_id":"Q105982358","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fZyyJ4NjyhWgad9a311YiD7JW45.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mPQ1g8CKjhPYGCFhkBMhSsH0n8N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aqvnBQQxG3MiQ0MHtIBl56FOW8z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/74KkwKbTQhHgxhS3QN6T1sxVKM9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.67,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4Ig5DRNR1IIgY2GjLdTEf4N7iRb.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":1372},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k9WIft0Pb34meJg8ikxxg2qR1Zf.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2047,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/mr6HJQVb8ClcmeT1ZchzlSVrVko.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1365}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":161316,"name":"social documentary"},{"id":270719,"name":"hong kong protests"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"IDFA","release_date":"2020-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"IDFA 2020 | Trailer | Inside The Red Brick Wall","key":"pf0RwklusUc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-10-28T15:26:57.000Z","id":"6006cabc706b9f003f271162"}]}}}
