In this, his brand new show, he seamlessly combines the very best of showbiz entertainment you'll currently find, in the world, possibly, as he wrestles with some of the big questions that all round entertainers shy away from.  Are we alone in the universe?  Is there life on Mars bars?  2lbs of potatoes.  Packet of ginger nuts.
