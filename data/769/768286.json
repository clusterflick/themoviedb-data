Nina, and Jimmie, a crippled newsboy who sells papers on the same corner, are sweethearts. Nina's grandmother dies, and she turns to Jimmie. One day Jimmie has a fight with another newsboy, whom he thinks is hanging about Nina's stand too much, and the other boy is soon begging for mercy. Miss Fifi Chandler, an artist, happens to be passing, and becoming interested, she accompanies Nina and Jimmie to their rooms, and is surprised to find that Jimmie is an artist, having made a beautiful plaster cast of Nina. Fifi brings Jimmie and his protégé to the notice of her fellow artist, Fred Townsend, who falls in love with Nina.","popularity":0.2537,"poster_path":"/xtCjjg71rTYSiA7sbIbpOscdRQV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36191,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fine Arts Film Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nina, the Flower Girl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bessie Love","original_name":"Bessie Love","popularity":0.3316,"profile_path":"/aOt4c5AoO1Zp8W93JTBnl1eEcFk.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Nina","credit_id":"5fbd7abc35c30a003e552f1e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8838,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elmer Clifton","original_name":"Elmer Clifton","popularity":0.1715,"profile_path":"/mvXMvJTfeZkj3rqU0ANVW5xUN92.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jimmie","credit_id":"5fbd7acb0c2710003e2cba78","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1573173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bert Hadley","original_name":"Bert Hadley","popularity":0.0597,"profile_path":"/v5KR0rddkZDSPi9DwJpZj4o8vOn.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Fred Townsend","credit_id":"5fbd7add54508d003dd43bdb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1106626,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Loyola O'Connor","original_name":"Loyola O'Connor","popularity":0.0798,"profile_path":"/nM2Weg44QUZULky2z379r7rr1k5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mrs. Townsend","credit_id":"5fbd7aee1750510042108491","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred Paget","original_name":"Alfred Paget","popularity":0.2494,"profile_path":"/rGXy9gRwMRb6GhU8bQeReH56hsJ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Archie Dean","credit_id":"5fbd7afcd9f4a6004099e8b9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1378032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rhea Haines","original_name":"Rhea Haines","popularity":0.1195,"profile_path":"/mO3CudWmum00r2cJ3tiXJVcNVe2.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Lotta","credit_id":"5fbd7b416bdec3003c21cc23","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennie Lee","original_name":"Jennie Lee","popularity":0.0782,"profile_path":"/8034W64tp7po3W3wijIXoOp0Fxg.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Nina's grandmother","credit_id":"5fbd7b509c97bd003f9f2221","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Warren","original_name":"Fred Warren","popularity":0.063,"profile_path":"/cFUgzKFwMEU696IeLDvRCNuYpuh.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dr. Fletcher","credit_id":"5fbd7b1f8b959e003d4858c6","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1795609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adele Clifton","original_name":"Adele Clifton","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Fifi Chandler","credit_id":"5fbd7b306bdec3003b21dd7f","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1572039,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mary H.
