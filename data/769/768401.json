The ship was carrying almost 1,800 Jewish refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe whom the British authorities were deporting from Mandatory Palestine to Mauritius because they lacked entry permits. Opposed to the deportation, the Haganah planted a bomb intended to disable the ship to prevent it from leaving Haifa. However, they miscalculated the effects of the explosion and the bomb sank the ship in less than 16 minutes (Dir. Pavel Štingl, 2006, 45 min.).  Pavel Stingl an award winning documentary filmmaker studied at the Film and Television Academy of the Performing Arts in Prague (FAMU). The screening is part of the ongoing “Docs in Salute” film series presented by the Library of Congress in collaboration with the Embassy of the Czech Republic.","popularity":0.1561,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":120016,"logo_path":null,"name":"Argo Films","origin_country":""},{"id":123279,"logo_path":null,"name":"K2","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"1997-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Story of the Shipwrecked from the Patria","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Story of Patria Survivors","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"הסיפור של ניצולי הפאטריה","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomáš Töpfer","original_name":"Tomáš Töpfer","popularity":0.2663,"profile_path":"/k4Wei4zDOAg7H8IZ6bhS5djZhMH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5fbe7a3c57530e00413c0f79","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2273414,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pavel Štingl","original_name":"Pavel Štingl","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/pVAwSgf1E8M7U1yQbyKYPYjrvF3.jpg","credit_id":"5fbe0b62f9475b0040c54ecd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2343701,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Milan Justin","original_name":"Milan Justin","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbe7a7d6bdec3003e233b1f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2389087,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dagmar Stehlíková","original_name":"Dagmar Stehlíková","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbe7aa69c97bd003fa09ad0","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2641236,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alona Abt","original_name":"Alona Abt","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbe7a8f323eba003ffda468","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1192745,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Václav Fiala","original_name":"Václav Fiala","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbe7a730c2710003e2e68c5","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2515647,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Markéta Štinglová","original_name":"Markéta Štinglová","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbe7a9b6bdec3003b234d72","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1628541,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Martin Kubala","original_name":"Martin Kubala","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbe7ab154508d003dd5c179","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1175609,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Vladimír Holomek","original_name":"Vladimír Holomek","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbe7a5b0c2710003e2e687a","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2273414,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pavel Štingl","original_name":"Pavel Štingl","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/pVAwSgf1E8M7U1yQbyKYPYjrvF3.jpg","credit_id":"5fbe7acd271ca5004053a39f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2374484,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jan Zikmund","original_name":"Jan Zikmund","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbe7a6617505100421234a2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2283433,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Hana Jemelíková","original_name":"Hana Jemelíková","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbe7a48323eba003efca9f7","department":"Crew","job":"Dramaturgy"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2273414,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pavel Štingl","original_name":"Pavel Štingl","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/pVAwSgf1E8M7U1yQbyKYPYjrvF3.jpg","credit_id":"5fbe7ac44c1d9a004082360d","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0145959","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ČT2","release_date":"1997-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
