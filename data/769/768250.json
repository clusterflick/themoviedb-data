The wolf convinces Red he is a police dog and he hastily beats a path to Grandma's house with intentions of making a meal of her. But Grandma's boyfriend shows up and takes her dancing. He then plans on eating Red, but the postman arrives with his draft induction notice.","popularity":0.1787,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1941-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Riding Hood Rides Again","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":121038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Berner","original_name":"Sara Berner","popularity":0.1748,"profile_path":"/cUvyj2PuoHU5FAtep9oOxLYaQEp.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Red Riding Hood (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"5fbd6aee7cffda003f17b4ad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Bletcher","original_name":"Billy Bletcher","popularity":0.4537,"profile_path":"/ncapDtCeDsMJxEKFXocJTFfnpau.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Wolf (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"5fbd6b026bdec3003d21cde7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1054825,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sid Marcus","original_name":"Sid Marcus","popularity":0.1236,"profile_path":"/bMPvXnD5uehHE4QH7CUOrQlxl76.jpg","credit_id":"5fbd6ac9263462003c0fb310","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0148665","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1941-12-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
