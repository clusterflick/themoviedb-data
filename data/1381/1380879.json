Rather than the rendezvous of his dreams, Jim experiences mostly excruciating bouts with personally invasive, costumed attendees. The evening unfolds with an escalating series of altercations between Jim and enemies real, fake, and inanimate, including two-faced Owen. Jim's personal nightmare culminates in bloody conflict with a relentless antagonist, a trip to the ER, and the long overdue unmasking of a bully.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"House of Masks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5034288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Atticus Jackson","original_name":"Atticus Jackson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Jim","credit_id":"67244805c1212313ac7eb5da","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5034289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Atticus Baldwin","original_name":"Atticus Baldwin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Kyle","credit_id":"6724480fcb548b716a823cca","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5034290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline Corry","original_name":"Caroline Corry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jennifer","credit_id":"67244819f08ab5d3f2037a37","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5034291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Domonique Brown","original_name":"Domonique Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Owen","credit_id":"67244829c1212313ac7eb5f7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5034292,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Rose","original_name":"Josh Rose","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Deckard","credit_id":"67244835cb548b716a823cf3","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5034288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Atticus Jackson","original_name":"Atticus Jackson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6724485501c4dbfa94f67d21","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2634846,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jason Weissbrod","original_name":"Jason Weissbrod","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6724486bcb548b716a823d18","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2634846,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jason Weissbrod","original_name":"Jason Weissbrod","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67244871cb548b716a823d20","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5034293,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Garth Herberg","original_name":"Garth Herberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6724487bcb548b716a823d31","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5034294,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jon Rothstein","original_name":"Jon Rothstein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672448860df4e66d4d92458c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5034293,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Garth Herberg","original_name":"Garth Herberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67244895c1212313ac7eb650","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4836915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Crager Cougar","original_name":"Crager Cougar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672448a4c1212313ac7eb671","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
