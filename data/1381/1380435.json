The work was commissioned for television by the NBC Opera Theatre and uses an English language libretto by the composer. Unlike Menotti's previous television operas, such as Amahl and the Night Visitors, this opera was written with no intention of being moved to live stage performance later. Menotti intended for this work to utilize the special effects unique to television which could not be recreated in live theatre. As a result, NBC's television production of the opera was the only performance the work had received until Ventura College mounted a production in June of 2020, directed by Brent Wilson. After its March 3, 1963 broadcast the opera was mainly criticized by the press for its trite use of allegory and music which rejected the avant-garde in favour of romanticism.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/rUdAetm6hOl2xpKl2lG3csTTNfp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1963-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Labyrinth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5032587,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Reardon","original_name":"John Reardon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Bridegroom","credit_id":"67230124991edb035c5f8d6c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5032588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judith Raskin","original_name":"Judith Raskin","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"The Bride","credit_id":"67230138fe2a8a011ed7376f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5032589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elaine Bonazzi","original_name":"Elaine Bonazzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The Spy","credit_id":"6723014c18827a9329f19896","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5032591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert White","original_name":"Robert White","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"The Old Chess Player","credit_id":"672301c218827a9329f198d8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5032592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beverly Wolff","original_name":"Beverly Wolff","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"The Executive Director","credit_id":"672301d582658aeeac9250cb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5032594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Rickner","original_name":"Bob Rickner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"The Executive Director's Secretary","credit_id":"672301ea18827a9329f198ea","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1200462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Porretta","original_name":"Frank Porretta","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"The Astronaut","credit_id":"6723020282658aeeac9250e6","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1725914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leon Lishner","original_name":"Leon Lishner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Death","credit_id":"6723022082658aeeac9250f6","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5032597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John West","original_name":"John West","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Death's Assistant","credit_id":"6723028c18827a9329f19925","order":8}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rUdAetm6hOl2xpKl2lG3csTTNfp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1963-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
