In using the “obsolete” medium of analog film \"Arder en deseo\" creates a temporal anachronism, a technological ellipsis, in which memory, oblivion and disappearance enter into poetical dialogue fifty years after the Chilean coup d'état.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arder en Deseo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3088990,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eszter Katalin","original_name":"Eszter Katalin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6722949d180b0a5ab90c34dc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Light Matter Film Festival","release_date":"2024-12-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
