Director Karin Junger investigates this with Anne-Fay Kops, Ted van Lieshout, Angel-Rose Oedit Doeb√©, Raymi Sambo, Boris van Berkum, Marian Markelo, Stephan Sanders and Thomas Chatterton Williams.","popularity":0.33,"poster_path":"/cGEC2ArxActsmQHKToq01FYksye.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22294,"logo_path":"/xD7TJlNqBQM6KmdWyr22TUK1rCt.png","name":"NTR","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2024-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Free Space","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285559,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karin Junger","original_name":"Karin Junger","popularity":0.0721,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672361b00cd8a2a503ad0da6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/838PGDJ3XMPb3sCCCbCrrjx3FxX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cGEC2ArxActsmQHKToq01FYksye.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2679,"name":"artist"},{"id":4411,"name":"sexism"},{"id":12425,"name":"racism"},{"id":213971,"name":"activism"},{"id":254518,"name":"artistic risk"},{"id":305613,"name":"cancel culture"},{"id":316968,"name":"cancelled"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
