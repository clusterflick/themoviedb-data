Though twins, they couldn’t be more different. Racine, whose scars are only on her torso and hands, is the defender, hitting back at their many bullies since childhood. Anaia, whose scars have marked her face, is the quiet one, content to live in her sister’s protective shadow. Their world is upended when the mother they’d believed long dead summons them to her bedside and reveals that their father is responsible for her bedridden state as well as the twins’ scars. They listen in disbelief as she orders them to kill their father for what he has done. Will they take up arms and spill blood? Or find mercy on the road to confront the man who destroyed everything?","popularity":1.4026,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":74251,"logo_path":null,"name":"Linden Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":41,"logo_path":"/xAot4SSOIHiWQ2WEnVXYGR1lce9.png","name":"Orion Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":210099,"logo_path":"/d6HwljzlOzxJ4tXlrpRkNZaZMWL.png","name":"Amazon MGM Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Is God Is","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1964315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kara Young","original_name":"Kara Young","popularity":0.1542,"profile_path":"/x6a4q3V21TEWg8xsl5W4zM7H442.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6722b8a018827a9329f18acb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3308114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mallori Johnson","original_name":"Mallori Johnson","popularity":0.1598,"profile_path":"/9wl5iQm3vrgdWv6UCiDjrlmqpLm.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6722b8a8c3f65a93a44ffe0a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1225953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sterling K.
