She is like a ghost, as she returns to the places where she grew up; places that no longer exist and probably will never exist again. In some places, the narrator meets different people. The thought \"The absence of the future has already begun\" is revived in their conversations, as well as the consequences of the war. Also, they question the coexistence of humanity with itself. She dares to dream about the future while immersing us in the present, which has changed our future forever.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Future of the Past","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5034416,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicole Medvecka","original_name":"Nicole Medvecka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67246735a616bbe715e1dd38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
