The AI narrator takes us through the most incomprehensible moments of our history. It uses its generalized knowledge to resolve our grasp of these moments into data-visualized images. It does so with confidence and a little bit of attitude, however, it tends to hallucinate. These hallucinations shine a light on what is needed to create a more ethical and accurate AI. Lake George was also chosen as a site of deep time and for its art historical significance. Its implications allow for long-term thinking today. Another component to help guide the future of AI.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deep Time of Latent Space","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2760563,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Souther","original_name":"Eric Souther","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672291df180b0a5ab90c3419","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Chroma Festival","release_date":"2024-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
