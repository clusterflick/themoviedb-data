Joy left Nigeria in order to help her family after the death of her father. She knew that she was going to sell sex before leaving, but was unaware of the hard working and life condition she would have had to face in France. Travel explores Joyâ€™s experiences of self-realisation and exploitation in the sex industry by representing the way she gradually reinterprets her experience of migration and freedom as also characterised by exploitation and trafficking.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":"/32JVnKaYe9ofdmEzrs55G92Lk1J.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":245173,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anamorphose productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Travel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2339939,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicola Mai","original_name":"Nicola Mai","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6723f41d90004810fecb0fcc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2339939,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicola Mai","original_name":"Nicola Mai","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673cb18908e8fd8518c95846","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2925088,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hadrien Bayard","original_name":"Hadrien Bayard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673cb196506dee7c1a056582","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2591448,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jean-Michel Perez","original_name":"Jean-Michel Perez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673cb1ae19ac32ceb1bd312f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.678,"height":1475,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/32JVnKaYe9ofdmEzrs55G92Lk1J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2016-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
