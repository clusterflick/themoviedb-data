This short film captures the perspective of eleven LGBT seniors in Los Angeles who came of age during a time in which imprisonment, daily discrimination, physical violence and abuse were commonplace. Exemplifying elegant survival, the individuals you will meet in An Oral History, made the community we have today possible. From the \"Daughters of Bilitis\" and \"Mattachine Society\" to the marches led by Frank Kameny and Barbara Gittings, the history of the LGBT movement has often been forgotten, overlooked or ignored. This is an attempt to give voice to and shine the light on the stories and lives of these individuals.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":243393,"logo_path":null,"name":"LA LGBT Center","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"LGBT Seniors Tell Their Stories","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5032271,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vance Malone","original_name":"Vance Malone","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6722c802eeb0c5ef3b9bc971","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5032272,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sarah Mcmurray","original_name":"Sarah Mcmurray","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6722c829eeb0c5ef3b9bc985","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5032273,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joe Biancaniello","original_name":"Joe Biancaniello","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6722c85882658aeeac924999","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
