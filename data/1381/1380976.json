Over 7,000 Jews escaped from Denmark to Sweden when the occupying Germans tried to round up Danish Jews in October 1943. Yet regrettably, 470 Jewish men, women and children were captured and put into cattle cars bound for the Theresienstadt concentration camp. Seventy years after they were miraculously rescued from Theresienstadt, six Danish Jews who were children at the time return to the concentration camp where they suffered for a year and a half, consumed by hunger, anxiety and fear of what tomorrow might bring. The six individual stories are intertwined, as the survivors tell of their failed escape to Sweden, the horrible journey to Theresienstadt, the appalling conditions in the concentration camp, and finally of their rescue from Theresienstadt in the final weeks of the war.","popularity":0.1096,"poster_path":"/jKzNJBgoflMropte5EFjtgce2jL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119,"logo_path":"/1di2gITGUZr730AMuMKiCrP90Vl.png","name":"DR","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":96859,"logo_path":"/yJAr9yuVtHOIDXklEHhwIrXKy8G.png","name":"STV Production","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2015-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Goodbye Theresienstadt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Theresienstadt - Danske Jøder i Hitlers Fangenskab","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5034628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellen Oppenhejm","original_name":"Ellen Oppenhejm","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6724b0b38d19261406615ded","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofie Gråbøl","original_name":"Sofie Gråbøl","popularity":0.4984,"profile_path":"/cG3s3Lknb0KjIJgKdroTkMTCi4N.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narration (da)","credit_id":"6724b0eea499cc2ef704fff9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5034635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julian Isherwood","original_name":"Julian Isherwood","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Narration (en)","credit_id":"6724b1938d19261406615e6c","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5034624,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonatan Jerichow","original_name":"Jonatan Jerichow","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6724b027c4aa98945ef34958","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5034625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carl Otto Dethlefsen","original_name":"Carl Otto Dethlefsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6724b037e7b37c73c69d201b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5034638,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Preben Hjorth","original_name":"Preben Hjorth","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6724b1e7e7b37c73c69d209d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1202354,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Itay Gross","original_name":"Itay Gross","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6724b1febb1ff9551a6d532f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5034640,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Armada Films","original_name":"Armada Films","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6724b227c4aa98945ef349cd","department":"Crew","job":"Drone Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":560181,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Niels Ostenfeld","original_name":"Niels Ostenfeld","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/tH034AFGj9DysFqlYb602xrHvYy.jpg","credit_id":"675aa840ff0272934b0acf4c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4717412","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":2818,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jKzNJBgoflMropte5EFjtgce2jL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"da","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
