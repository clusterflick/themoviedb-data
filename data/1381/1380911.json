Kilimanjaro, one of the seven summits and the highest peak in Africa. They have been brought together by the charity INARA to shed light on the impact of war on children. The mountain always has a lesson, and often not what we think or expect it to be. Not all will make it to the summit, some will be forced to face dormant personal demons. This is a story of physical and emotional adventure, the rollercoaster of life, and the possibilities that emerge when we stand together.","popularity":0.4583,"poster_path":"/lLTntdLv9J81sjg9n5pID201RSt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TZ","name":"Tanzania"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"},{"english_name":"Swahili","iso_639_1":"sw","name":"Kiswahili"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seize the Summit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5034432,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arwa Damon","original_name":"Arwa Damon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67246c45c1c7433ebbc41f72","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lLTntdLv9J81sjg9n5pID201RSt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":409,"name":"africa"},{"id":159212,"name":"mountain climbing"},{"id":255805,"name":"war refugees"},{"id":341845,"name":"mount kilimanjaro"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
