The state in pre-retirement sends 425 Namibian children, whom it had rescued from Angolan camps eleven years earlier, “home.” Hastily. But why? When Grote, Kunert and the children arrive, a Namibian minister explains that the East German supporters of these colonial war victims are now out of power. The new powers had no interest … In the Leipzig festival selection in 1990, and again in 1991, this film about German-Namibian foreignness and alienation cannot be found. The Retrospective 2024 makes up for this strange omission.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Staßfurt – Windhoek","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1701211,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lilly Grote","original_name":"Lilly Grote","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/r6iTb0YdSQXR55toDI6etCE6gwi.jpg","credit_id":"6722aa3447fe097c193fae1a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2407381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julia Kunert","original_name":"Julia Kunert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6722aa3beeb0c5ef3b9bc5f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
