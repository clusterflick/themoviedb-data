On this particular day the envoy of God is twelve -year-old Fatima. She is left in a village market, wearing an explosive belt with ten minutes until she kills the enemies of God. But this is the market where Fatima’s mother works and where she rediscovers life. For ten minutes we accompany her on the nail-biting journey of a martyr from the present to the past. With one minute left on the clock, she faces her mother. Confronted by her own helplessness, will time stop?","popularity":0.2245,"poster_path":"/h62ookGFViEgWvy0XD6Wa40rn4a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51744,"logo_path":"/x3tV3BEYxaGTAXWuQ3uW4LI5q6F.png","name":"Diam Production","origin_country":"BF"},{"id":186763,"logo_path":"/7Z3QlTRfGIyMur2hY6ppv0C6gCz.png","name":"Karekezi Film Production","origin_country":"RW"},{"id":177157,"logo_path":"/ocm6TD8wZUUZJ2dpxnUBze2oUqs.png","name":"Tabou Production","origin_country":"NE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BF","name":"Burkina Faso"},{"iso_3166_1":"NE","name":"Niger"},{"iso_3166_1":"RW","name":"Rwanda"}],"release_date":"2023-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Messenger of God","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Envoy of God","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"A Enviada de Deus","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":226554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Youssouf Djaoro","original_name":"Youssouf Djaoro","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/cJMr9eeii1XTs5HpV66JfcBBj0X.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64dc92b659e8a900ac07e2f9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4218301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salimata Hassane","original_name":"Salimata Hassane","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64dc92d0a3b5e60139ffff2c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3053338,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Moumouni Jupiter Sodre","original_name":"Moumouni Jupiter Sodre","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dc932f59e8a900e2282a97","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1600953,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oriane Brun-Moschetti","original_name":"Oriane Brun-Moschetti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dc9324d100b614b15965e9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1665892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amina Abdoulaye Mamani","original_name":"Amina Abdoulaye Mamani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dc92a7001bbd044133cf47","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2913992,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Amath Niane","original_name":"Amath Niane","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dc931737109700e227f0b0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1665892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amina Abdoulaye Mamani","original_name":"Amina Abdoulaye Mamani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dc92f337109700ac437b7f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3053339,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sylvain Dando Pare","original_name":"Sylvain Dando Pare","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dc934037109700c51d3080","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26769425","wikidata_id":"Q126016526","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":786,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h62ookGFViEgWvy0XD6Wa40rn4a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":556}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BF","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Fespaco 2023","release_date":"2023-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"FCAT 2023 |  L’Envoyée de Dieu, de Amina A.
