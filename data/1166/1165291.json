As a woman, she realised quite soon that she had to be physically strong too. That is why, at the age of 40, she embarked on a career of a power triathlete and soon became a multiple world champion and the strongest woman in the world. Using the power of social media, she ran a campaign for animal rights, opened animal shelters and looked for new families for dozens of stray dogs and cats. When Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Anna went on to help wounded and abandoned animals.","popularity":0.2942,"poster_path":"/dqKNC10OYz0my1OVMdLzh52sd4r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":250,"logo_path":"/evWKasiElVQywuKv2dI72P9twz8.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":89501,"logo_path":"/4Q4X75oTsSF1VMOLldeIBINoPDt.png","name":"Aura
