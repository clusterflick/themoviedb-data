She was a truly stunning success and was in almost every Soviet family. The first number on it was the work \"Canzone\" by the composer Francesco da Milano (1497-1543). To the tune of the \"Canzone\", the poet Henri Volokhonsky composed the poem \"Over the Blue Sky\", using biblical images from the Old Testament Book of the prophet Ezekiel. The song \"Under the Blue Sky\" became the most famous ballad, and the aria \"Ave Maria\" became a worldwide opera hit. And suddenly, twenty years after the release of the record, it turned out that the withered Italian composers on the cover do not have such works, and their author is the Hero of our film – self-taught Vladimir Vavilov. In the film, Andrey \"Ryusha\" Reshetin, a violinist, researcher of Russian music and language of the Baroque era, discusses the secrets of music.","popularity":0.0538,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2023-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Golden City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1118001,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergey Debizhev","original_name":"Сергей Дебижев","popularity":0.0731,"profile_path":"/8rqyfbCy0kIY9NChXm4KaPhnNhs.jpg","credit_id":"64dad75af495ee028f65b222","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-08-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
