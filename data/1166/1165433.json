Bulleid brings his professional life and passionate pastime together in a tragic tale of young love hindered by an incurable disability and the cruelty of society.  Ted works as a fireman on a steam locomotive and is deeply in love with Emily, a beautiful young lady. But Emily has a disability, the result of a childhood accident which left her with a terrible limp. Constant pity from friends and the prying eyes of strangers drives a wedge between the pair, and Ted's confrontation with colleagues outside Emily's house leads to harsh words, and tragic consequences.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/5jwf21jWXcGZdxAGkZFu96b7sqI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1935-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A young couple's struggle to deal with disability leads to a tragic end.","title":"Danger Signal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4217072,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"H.A.V.
