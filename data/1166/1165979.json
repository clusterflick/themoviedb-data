Le Guin’s novel ‘The Left Hand of Darkness’ (1969), scored by Chu-Li Shewring’s remix of the House track ‘Brighter Days’ (1992) by Cajmere featuring Dajae. ‘Aureole’ is a transition between a lost chapter from ‘Diviner’ and ‘Wendy’ (2022, forthcoming), a film fan-letter to composer Wendy Carlos, whose many interests include solar eclipse photography. Accelerating to a euphoric end, the film is the duration of the longest total solar eclipse, when the moon completely covers the sun.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/kcNyH8Lz1chS33MYNLyI8EA350q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aureole","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2389944,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frances Scott","original_name":"Frances Scott","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dd341637109700ffb8975c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kcNyH8Lz1chS33MYNLyI8EA350q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
