They care about their domestic animals and are sons of the soil. The outside World is of little interest to the villagers. Thirteen-year-old \"Devil\" Pascha and his gang are always to blame for anything that adds to the chaos in the village. With enthusiasm and cheekiness, he plays pranks on the others, be it the Mullah of the Village, his mother or his sister. His wild temperament and tricks only lead to more disorder between the children and the adults in the village. One day a fat German soprano singer visits the village. She wants to live there for a while to write her doctoral thesis on Kurdish folk dancing and singing. The feudal lord Ali Aga, the Mullah, and in fact all the men, dream of marrying the yellow-haired woman. She does not understand what is going on in the village, but \"Devil\" Pascha does and uses this get up to new mischief.","popularity":0.1101,"poster_path":"/dohI6RuRQ9WGbEoX8spHMG9bsYN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gelbe Tage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","title":"Sarı Günler","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":142781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nur Sürer","original_name":"Nur Sürer","popularity":0.508,"profile_path":"/dHTgCwwmGyvJK5LyCpFtzYpap2d.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64db24c97719d7013dd6b415","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1283562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Haugg","original_name":"Alexander Haugg","popularity":0.0991,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64db24fdf495ee02943190a3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3510858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bekir Ma'rof","original_name":"Bekir Ma'rof","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"64db2510001bbd00c6c8e585","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":239777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandra Steffl","original_name":"Sandra Steffl","popularity":0.0916,"profile_path":"/6XmNIuHd0tegHvNkjI4DD1RwFlx.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"64db2558371097011c517239","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2995600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hama Ali Khan","original_name":"Hama Ali Khan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"64db2580bf31f201ce6a6da8","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1196887,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kadir Sözen","original_name":"Kadir Sözen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64db2494d100b6011c83a4ec","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1879893,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Erdal Kahraman","original_name":"Erdal Kahraman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64db24a6001bbd00e35d1f46","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4216089,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ravin Asaf","original_name":"Ravin Asaf","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64db2451f495ee028f65d9fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4216089,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ravin Asaf","original_name":"Ravin Asaf","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64db248159e8a900ac073042","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2411470,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Serter Alkaya","original_name":"Serter Alkaya","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65804002df86a808dae81222","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4414987,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Maarten van de Voort","original_name":"Maarten van de Voort","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65804009875d1a07aaae9434","department":"Sound","job":"Production Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4436587,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mevlüt Kovac","original_name":"Mevlüt Kovac","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6580401adf86a808f9e80102","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2257554,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Selda Ulkenciler","original_name":"Selda Ulkenciler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658040142f8d09099ea77738","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0349482","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1922,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dohI6RuRQ9WGbEoX8spHMG9bsYN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
