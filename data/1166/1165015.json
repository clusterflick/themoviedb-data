These days, terms such as \"white privilege\", \"intersectionality\", \"cancel culture\", and the adjective \"racialised\" are defining a new relationship between minorities, differences, and society, especially among the younger generation.\r What is the origin of this vocabulary? What does 'wokism' mean? What is the origin of its adoption in France? Is it an opportunity? Or a threat? Is this an unfortunate implementation of a model not our own? This documentary delves into the origins and consequences of a phenomenon that is no longer trivial through archive footage and insights from prestigious contributors, analysts, and witnesses.","popularity":0.4239,"poster_path":"/7B6MbjFGP9nGB3UnysiTtziVZFD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":206246,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Fact Doc","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":122245,"logo_path":null,"name":"TV Presse Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":127436,"logo_path":"/85hn0WZVj2wpm7scTkrQz76lKJ7.png","name":"LCP -
