It was created in 2020 by Dagestani journalist Svetlana Anokhina. After their shelter was raided by a joined team of Chechen and Dagestani cops, they had to leave Russia. But Svetlana continues to evacuate girls. The documentary traces these runaways on different phases of evacuation – from their republics to the long process of rehabilitation in other countries. But abusers threaten not only girls. Members of the Marem Group are not safe even outside Russia. They can also become runaways at any moment.","popularity":0.1662,"poster_path":"/wxb19Ucl6s96KOSlhwSUlTmbmZs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2024-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Runaways","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3255669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir Sevrinovsky","original_name":"Vladimir Sevrinovsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dc69d659e8a90139d6367b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3255669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir Sevrinovsky","original_name":"Vladimir Sevrinovsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dc69e7b77d4b113e057d0e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3255669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir Sevrinovsky","original_name":"Vladimir Sevrinovsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dc69effe077a00c7313907","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3255670,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Svetlana Anokhina","original_name":"Svetlana Anokhina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dc69fdd100b6011c84408d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wxb19Ucl6s96KOSlhwSUlTmbmZs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
