For this purpose I first looked for a suitable motif; it should be devoid of emotional or physical meaning and should not represent any function or idea. But it should very well already have a process-like dynamic, which I then wanted to take up with my design and, so to speak, 'transform'. I made a wooden light box with a glass surface; I mounted a red light underneath and a graph paper template on the glass with precise graphic instructions for the positions of the filmstrip on the photostrip. I had calculated that I could move the 16mm film 12 times across the width of the 35mm format, each time shifting the optical soundtrack by 3mm.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/otIfBjvkcPNoAyN5QkAkCh0i2Yp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Felder 9.6","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2163356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Mank","original_name":"Thomas Mank","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64db62d4f495ee029431abdd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/otIfBjvkcPNoAyN5QkAkCh0i2Yp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"IFF Oberhausen","release_date":"1989-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
