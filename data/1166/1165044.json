Her films, however, showcase a bold vision that goes way beyond the merely “weird,” offering a provocative perspective on family, sexuality, power dynamics, and the inherent strangeness of human interaction. In this original documentary, David Thompson travels to the Greek island of Hydra to meet up with Tsangari and discuss her directorial philosophy and what it means to “live cinema.”","popularity":0.1721,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10932,"logo_path":"/AscjWwkpQC23EZgRxbeOqs4KhRI.png","name":"The Criterion Channel","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Athina Rachel Tsangari: Cinema on the Edges","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":236884,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Athina Rachel Tsangari","original_name":"Athina Rachel Tsangari","popularity":0.2555,"profile_path":"/9rb6dWdCJzP6uptGTdq2NmkXx5N.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64da9002b77d4b1143464cf3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4215362,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Thompson","original_name":"David Thompson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64da9020b77d4b114017ef4b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1394220,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Christina Moumouri","original_name":"Χριστίνα Μουμούρη","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64da9138f495ee0290e53d26","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1128435,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leandros Ntounis","original_name":"Λέανδρος Ντούνης","popularity":0.0665,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64da915ab77d4b113e0489f7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2181839,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Colin Minchin","original_name":"Colin Minchin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64da916cf495ee0290e53d3a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2102592,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Giles Sherwood","original_name":"Giles Sherwood","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64da91997719d700e5c7ef05","department":"Crew","job":"Post Production Supervisor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Premiered on the Criterion Channel","release_date":"2016-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
