From an economic point of view, however, it belongs to the fastest developing regions of our continent. There is a constant hustle and bustle here. The city is becoming denser and developers are dividing up the last green areas. Buildings, often insensitively located, push out our inconspicuous neighbors from Bratislava. We start to miss them - so we look for replacements. We subconsciously feel that we are part of nature. But at the same time we also need a city. We live here, work here, go to school, shop in countless supermarkets. We enjoy walking through the old streets and along the Danube embankment. We live, or perhaps rather survive, in a city environment. On the fortified banks of the Danube, in the middle of concrete and asphalt. But fortunately, we are not alone here, as evidenced by the attentiveness of filmmaker Branislav Molnár.","popularity":0.1784,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":24023,"logo_path":"/yz6m1ty4qGvlkfReuqPZxdmD8V2.png","name":"RTVS","origin_country":"SK"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bratislava, mesto uprostred prírody","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2701452,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kamil Mikulčík","original_name":"Kamil Mikulčík","popularity":0.1104,"profile_path":"/jupVPkRcfwGaXZqUI45hxFS4vGA.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"64db88cdd100b600ada310c0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3779310,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Branislav Molnár","original_name":"Branislav Molnár","popularity":0.1099,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64db876337109700c51cb322","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3059486,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Braňo Molnár","original_name":"Braňo Molnár","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64db886cf495ee029431bb67","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4216720,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dušan Senko","original_name":"Dušan Senko","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64db8881b77d4b113fc4b537","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3643114,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tomáš Pašteka","original_name":"Tomáš Pašteka","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64db885559e8a900c59f8997","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3059486,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Braňo Molnár","original_name":"Braňo Molnár","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64db8887b77d4b113e0512e1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3005008,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stanislav Kollár","original_name":"Stanislav Kollár","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64db88c1b77d4b114346d2f4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1380933,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Martin Hasák","original_name":"Martin Hasák","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64db88b859e8a900c59f89e7","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3634672,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Lipovský","original_name":"Peter Lipovský","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64db886259e8a900c59f899e","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6937028","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sk","note":"Festival Hory a mesto","release_date":"2017-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
