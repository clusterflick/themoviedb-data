Neither have biked more than 5 miles or spent much time in the outdoors.  Riding Han is an adventure cycling film, with its foundational essence based on the Korean word “han” (한).  Han is an inherent, undefinable and complex part of being Korean. It is internalized/unresolved collective grief, resentment and rage created by deep intergenerational trauma and oppression. Han manifests itself in the human experience of adversity through emotion, expression, and creation.  Riding Han captures our journey as three Korean Americans, while exploring our identities through Han as Asian Americans, in a divisive time during the COVID-19 pandemic with anti-Asian hate on the rise. Han brought clarity that this is my time to create.","popularity":0.0685,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Riding Han (Riding 한)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4215947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pak Eugene","original_name":"Pak Eugene","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64daf83a59e8a900ac071958","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2569691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Young Mazino","original_name":"Young Mazino","popularity":0.9018,"profile_path":"/bseVfwPNhDlToTIGs7FuKzd0uxi.jpg","credit_id":"64daf84c7719d700e5c8270d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4215947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pak Eugene","original_name":"Pak Eugene","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64daf85b7719d700c8602c95","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
