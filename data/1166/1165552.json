However, for Theo the weekend is extra special… he’s planning on proposing to Simone! After arriving at the holiday home they are staying in for the weekend, Theo makes arrangements for the proposal. He enlists his best friend – and best man – Robert to help him (and to keep their other friends from finding out). But Theo's best friends continue to thwart his plans, and nearly destroy his relationship with Simone.","popularity":0.2887,"poster_path":"/eHK45lgaX6AvpkqmdViDNgUHEa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84624,"logo_path":"/mY4SMEplDeqrLF2kBLShp4qJSvK.png","name":"Proportion Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-01-08","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just Say Yes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2843106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cleopatra Wood","original_name":"Cleopatra Wood","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Simone","credit_id":"64dbf37a7719d700afbfda28","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3860220,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Stallone Thomas","original_name":"Stephen Stallone Thomas","popularity":0.1433,"profile_path":"/6XBzumE0OSJ8S9K0kyH09OjoYwL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Robert","credit_id":"64dbf384001bbd041bf3f1ba","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2989856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Faith Kiggundu","original_name":"Faith Kiggundu","popularity":0.2163,"profile_path":"/yaDBpb1bq3vUyYraxRUxLFWjuOE.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Christina","credit_id":"64dbf38e001bbd041af35bd7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3060972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akil Largie","original_name":"Akil Largie","popularity":0.0719,"profile_path":"/rAFF2NYg5scEF1I4pc5EKiPTvNF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Theo","credit_id":"64dbf39cf495ee028f662761","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3860228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Patrick Brooks","original_name":"Sean Patrick Brooks","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Jim","credit_id":"64dbf3a5001bbd041bf3f1d0","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1480608,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stuart Alson","original_name":"Stuart Alson","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":"/oqeOAcZkqiVl1BWWiDhdJ4Tx5hH.jpg","credit_id":"64dbf3b6d100b600ff0d04cd","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1480607,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicole Holland","original_name":"Nicole Holland","popularity":0.1539,"profile_path":"/xXqEm0OiSGMJGnCs78YeYeAyTkR.jpg","credit_id":"64dbf3c4fe077a00e43639c0","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1644164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Becca Hirani","original_name":"Becca Hirani","popularity":0.8513,"profile_path":"/hb3Gch6qk239AI4AgHcoBWgzZwv.jpg","credit_id":"64dbf3ced100b600e26bad9d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2735291,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tyler-James","original_name":"Tyler-James","popularity":0.122,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dbf3da371097013946a1a0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3781415,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chase Martins","original_name":"Chase Martins","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659c5faac50ad2243f5ae0db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27746191","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eHK45lgaX6AvpkqmdViDNgUHEa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":13027,"name":"wedding"},{"id":237463,"name":"imminent wedding"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Just Say Yes - Trailer 2023","key":"wqg8DBJvqdo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2023-09-22T21:14:22.000Z","id":"65198576ea84c700eb99bcf4"}]}}}
