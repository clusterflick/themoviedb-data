Miloš Majda is a ranger in the Malá Fatra National Park. For more than thirty years, the forest has been his second home. A few years ago, Miloš tried a very interesting experiment. He took a lynx cub from the zoo, undertook to raise it and return it to the wild. He managed to overcome the initial problems, when the cub, separated from its mother, refused to take food and fell ill. However, the little lynx soon turned out to be a real lively devil.
