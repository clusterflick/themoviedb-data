His films feature scenes of border life, Mexican-American parades, and, of course, excited children on Christmas morning.  The films named to the registry were shot on 9.5mm film, a unique amateur film format popular primarily in Europe. The films were preserved by TAMI in 2015. A selection of the films are available to view on the TAMI website.  TAMI's Executive Director, Caroline Frick, says: \"We are thrilled to learn of the inclusion of the Fuentes Family Collection to the National Film Registry. The Fuentes' films beautifully document life on both sides of the Texas-Mexico border, and illustrate the rich confluence of cultures that has made, and continues to make, Texas' story vital to understanding the United States.\"","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/utwCMaDQiS3XkCFnUiqQPj0256K.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1938-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fuentes Family Home Movies Collection","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1954441,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antonio Rodríguez Fuentes","original_name":"Antonio Rodríguez Fuentes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677d7c75ec51791dfe66c9b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1954442,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josefina Barrera Fuentes","original_name":"Josefina Barrera Fuentes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677d7c89cf4d59c84f728c1d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1120,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/utwCMaDQiS3XkCFnUiqQPj0256K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":747}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1938-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
