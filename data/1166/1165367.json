This time, he turns the spotlight on the regime of terror and violence forged by transnational companies, in collaboration with the Mexican government and organized crime allowing them to appropriate land and exploit resources. With respect and careful attention to detail, the film uncovers the courage and dignity of resistance to this new kind of colonialism that is both destructive and murderous in nature and reigns with utter impunity. The camera hones in on the faces of those who have dared to speak out, and on their daily lives, which have been turned upside down. It magnifies a land of great beauty and richness marked by physical and psychological scars.","popularity":0.0882,"poster_path":"/4PhpQGNif36exOad0dCkXCz5AeQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13839,"logo_path":"/125UdB9wgDkY2RNpjgCiKyk3Dll.png","name":"Metafilms","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":116053,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinéma Belmopán","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2023-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The White Guard","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"La Guardia Blanca","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2764885,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Audrey-Ann Dupuis-Pierre","original_name":"Audrey-Ann Dupuis-Pierre","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64db8fe9b77d4b11425defdf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1015839,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sylvain Corbeil","original_name":"Sylvain Corbeil","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/qPcqRomdQSb1FiDOvqUkymn9WHP.jpg","credit_id":"64db9043f495ee0291a1006a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":873486,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicolás Celis","original_name":"Nicolás Celis","popularity":0.1072,"profile_path":"/ql4Ev93GkFoneI3UygLB5wMsL78.jpg","credit_id":"64db906df495ee0290e5bb57","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116943,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julien Elie","original_name":"Julien Elie","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64db907e37109700ffb7d4aa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2468396,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Xi Feng","original_name":"Xi Feng","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64db90b9001bbd0418c38d3a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1482880,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mimi Allard","original_name":"Mimi Allard","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64db90d8f495ee029356b20f","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2145826,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Capeille","original_name":"Daniel Capeille","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64db90f4001bbd041bf3d050","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1294674,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sylvain Bellemare","original_name":"Sylvain Bellemare","popularity":0.2918,"profile_path":"/kGsqhWsy3TP92U5widUlBgUkLV4.jpg","credit_id":"64db9114a3b5e600e29b63b9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1392961,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hans Laitres","original_name":"Hans Laitres","popularity":0.0927,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64db9139a3b5e60139ff811c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116943,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julien Elie","original_name":"Julien Elie","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64db9374f495ee0291a1019f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1453113,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"François Messier-Rheault","original_name":"François Messier-Rheault","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6553c0eaad50f00108a2d76f","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170645,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ernesto Pardo","original_name":"Ernesto Pardo","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6553c10b9653f613f629c155","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt19864208","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1564,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/4PhpQGNif36exOad0dCkXCz5AeQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1042}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"RIDM","release_date":"2023-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Filmfest Hamburg","release_date":"2023-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"12A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Central Scotland Documentary Festival","release_date":"2024-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
