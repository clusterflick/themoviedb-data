Researching Amrani's documents, Raveh found several short screenplays, and sought out three directors of Amrani's generation to bring them to life. The short films are interwoven throughout the documentary - \"The Boat\", directed by Nir Bergman, \"Albert and Ronit\", directed by Dover Kosashvili, and \"Sabbath Eve\", directed by Joseph Cedar. The warmth, intensity and drama of family life; issues of Persian ethnicity; tradition and the desire to break away from tradition; the competition and camaraderie of boys and men; the search for love; a persistent spiritual search and a love of the sea - all these are reflected in the brief yet intriguing vignettes, imbuing the film with a sense of Amrani's vision as a filmmaker and how his presence might have influenced the Israeli film scene.","popularity":0.2088,"poster_path":"/y3LvesiFNWxDVU6ZXHqGsZTpINJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sharon
