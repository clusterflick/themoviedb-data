After traveling in Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad - interviewing musicians and scholars, attending music concerts, and observing the teaching of music in various institutions, Yousuf not only documented some of the surviving practitioners and patrons of classical music, but also raised many vital questions, about cultural identity, nationalism, legitimacy of music in Islam, Pakistan's popular culture and its affairs with India, and the survival of classical music itself in South Asia. This quest has resulted in a musical documentary film, Khayal Darpan, featuring some well-known as well as many lesser known but talented musicians of Pakistan.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/hS6nzWObG1TVvY1Xb7Ne89LiZ3N.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"},{"iso_3166_1":"PK","name":"Pakistan"}],"release_date":"2006-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"},{"english_name":"Punjabi","iso_639_1":"pa","name":"ਪੰਜਾਬੀ"},{"english_name":"Urdu","iso_639_1":"ur","name":"اردو"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Mirror of Imagination","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4217215,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yousuf Saeed","original_name":"Yousuf Saeed","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dbcc5ed100b6011c83edbc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1232,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hS6nzWObG1TVvY1Xb7Ne89LiZ3N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":821}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ur","note":"","release_date":"2006-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Khayal Darpan - excerpt from documentary film on classical music in Pakistan","key":"Xh-NZmSFqQo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2016-08-14T12:58:16.000Z","id":"64dbce65f495ee029356c50e"}]}}}
