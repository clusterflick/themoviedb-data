As COVID-19 puts Casablanca and the Haro familyâ€™s very way of life in jeopardy, our film examines the unique relationship between this special restaurant and the Venice, California community it serves. Through social and economic upheaval, family strife, and a literal pandemic, Casablanca and the family who run it continue to thrive thanks to hard work, creative inspiration, and an ever shifting but always colorful cast of customers, friends, and family.","popularity":0.0436,"poster_path":"/9wlQ76icJaekntFLi0zfpOck2Gp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Of all the Gin Joints","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1992874,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Kornfield","original_name":"David Kornfield","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dd26595ab81a00e25a3885","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4219215,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Adam Coleman","original_name":"Adam Coleman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dd266b59e8a900ac081b8f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3674142,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Garrett P.
