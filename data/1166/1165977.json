When she arrived in London in 1966, Lijn lived in a bedsit and was unable to do much more than draw her ideas for sculptures. Then, she found that there were many small industrial companies in London and she began to use them. The factories themselves fascinated Lijn but, although she spent a considerable amount of time in them in the first years she lived in London, Lijn only managed to film a very small part of the amazing places and strange visions she saw.","popularity":0.0388,"poster_path":"/jmnn9qkjquYfTpjzXmEuz7c43jU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Factory Snaps","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4219298,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liliane Lijn","original_name":"Liliane Lijn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dd315cb77d4b11425e9aea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jmnn9qkjquYfTpjzXmEuz7c43jU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
