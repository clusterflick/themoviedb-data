The film is typically an experimental film and has no intention of reporting from Dissing's tour. It makes use of e.g. double exposures (multiple images copied on top of each other) and fragmentary sound clips to capture the moods of the traveling musicians.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fiddler's Rearview Mirror","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2956521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benny Andersen","original_name":"Benny Andersen","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"60feb921db72c0002fd50fc5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1356775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Povl Dissing","original_name":"Povl Dissing","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"60feb93da58902002f9b948c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1459129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Povl Dissing","original_name":"Povl Dissing","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60feb8a81684f7005f09b113","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3173024,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Benny Andersen","original_name":"Benny Andersen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60feb8ffa589020045994cdd","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3173023,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Søren Hansen","original_name":"Søren Hansen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60feb86ef8595800613a1b34","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
