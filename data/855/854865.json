Australia’s fauna have evolved to coexist with bushfire, but these Black Summer fires are unprecedented in their scale, speed and intensity. Many native animals are unable to escape, or endure, without human help.  We follow iconic species like koalas, kangaroos, wombats, and an endangered parrot through their rescue, rehabilitation and eventual release. Remarkable tales of compassion and dedication are revealed along the way – from an orphan wombat growing too attached to her carer, to audacious helicopter airdrops to feed remote rock wallabies.  When the fires finally burn out, Australia looks to the science, innovation and Indigenous knowledge that will be needed to safeguard fragile wildlife in an even hotter future.","popularity":0.1322,"poster_path":"/yFVgnS8wboglmoWO1TzOFvs115o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75207,"logo_path":"/5HMd3ADYzBGuvLFuRycSIWDpJFf.png","name":"WildBear Entertainment","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2020-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bushfire Animal Rescue","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2983667,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Max Bourke","original_name":"Max Bourke","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641c7fbdd75bd62436f01a1b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2215188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anja Taylor","original_name":"Anja Taylor","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641c7fddd75bd624d53586b7","department":"Directing","job":"Field Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2983667,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Max Bourke","original_name":"Max Bourke","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641c7fb2142ef100f8bf819b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2215188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anja Taylor","original_name":"Anja Taylor","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641c80aab9a0bd00b8fd02ec","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1602244,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bettina Dalton","original_name":"Bettina Dalton","popularity":0.1536,"profile_path":"/jnziFVBdLMXdIAi3ue1faJaBW4r.jpg","credit_id":"641c807d142ef100d9bbdb41","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2736493,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Holly Trueman","original_name":"Holly Trueman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641c8092b9a0bd009954a715","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13351936","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xpa5KJ2yiwqKgaeB4EodDiYg2rQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4BjCMoM0rODIWTyOuA9bVh20hrI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/yFVgnS8wboglmoWO1TzOFvs115o.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":666},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eCxOhLjfCne9VqQG6v8kvjgrJa4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18330,"name":"nature"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"SBS","release_date":"2020-08-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
