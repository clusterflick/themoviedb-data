Fábio Silva uses the cinematic apparatus to take us on a trip to the past, to his past, towards the reasons behind his current estrangement from his father, calling on home videos as evidence of his account. A mysterious film in which the young filmmaker risks exposing his family privacy, full of betrayal and forgiveness. It is a privilege to watch a story told with such boldness, in which the boundaries between author, audience, and family trauma are barely distinguishable.","popularity":0.047,"poster_path":"/eWLWZEJJcpCOAGgoTmu0VPNWaW8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2021-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fruit of Thy Womb","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2800850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fábio Silva","original_name":"Fábio Silva","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"619e7856ea7b0e00635441a9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2800850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fábio Silva","original_name":"Fábio Silva","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60fd94142fdec60029f8ca9b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2800850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fábio Silva","original_name":"Fábio Silva","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619e77ffb4a543008ebcf21f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2800850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fábio Silva","original_name":"Fábio Silva","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619e7816663627002d39501b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3318452,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"André de Almeida","original_name":"André de Almeida","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619e782e1283e9002c20a0d4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2800850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fábio Silva","original_name":"Fábio Silva","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619e783e663627002d395046","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3318451,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"João Pedro Soares","original_name":"João Pedro Soares","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619e78934f9a990024564036","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27882905","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1728,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2GzlK05tQk3LxgqbRiObIMO89zV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3072}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":1799,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eWLWZEJJcpCOAGgoTmu0VPNWaW8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1221}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
