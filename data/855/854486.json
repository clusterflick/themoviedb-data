He is 63 years old. He lives alone with his two cats and decides to move in the house where he will live the last chapter of the book of his life. While packing, he starts to have to choose what to take with him. Bernard is my master and I am his slave. His last lover. I help him put away his whip in a box, between the remains of his memory, tokens of lovers stripped from his arms by AIDS, traces of a foster family that pushed him away, of a rigid education that marked him, of a mother and a father that he never met. Our sexual games are the possibility for two generations to meet: between a whip and a leather harness we discuss love, death, the AIDS epidemic of the 80s, his new life project, us. The wounds and the grave goods of a survivor, a cry of life under the lights of sexual pulsions.","popularity":0.0697,"poster_path":"/rlvy5q5u3p3hBCrd1QMUjweSiXf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":153701,"logo_path":null,"name":"Altara Films","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":48686,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bocalupo Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Chapter","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1653029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gianluca Matarrese","original_name":"Gianluca Matarrese","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ff05a354a8ac005e09f036","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1653029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gianluca Matarrese","original_name":"Gianluca Matarrese","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ff05ae54a8ac002d666c4d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1653029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gianluca Matarrese","original_name":"Gianluca Matarrese","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ff05bbf10a1a002435f059","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1653029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gianluca Matarrese","original_name":"Gianluca Matarrese","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ff05c333ec26002f6e8523","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giovanni Donfrancesco","original_name":"Giovanni Donfrancesco","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ff05d2a5890200744c0b20","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1600908,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Giorgia Villa","original_name":"Giorgia Villa","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ff05dfcee481005e32cba8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giovanni Donfrancesco","original_name":"Giovanni Donfrancesco","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ff05ed568463005e2488a4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3243195,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nico Morabito","original_name":"Nico Morabito","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/ndLnDyUqGfjqQ6eE5wVAB1X6Aef.jpg","credit_id":"614ada41609750005f8eeec2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15099928","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cijDaJXP797QUKWwPcKPcgjYXh5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.682,"height":1467,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rlvy5q5u3p3hBCrd1QMUjweSiXf.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.681,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pE5f6LiDc3oKgmjaIHylDVdAxi4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1363}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Venice International Film Critics' Week","release_date":"2021-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
