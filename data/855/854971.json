A neon line grows into various symbols while a poetic text about \"borders\" glides in and out of the frame. A border is a line. It creates an incision between a past and a present, a \"here\" and \"there.\" It separates entities, a \"you\" and an \"I\". The line can also incise, the act of the cut compositing personal histories of relationship, migration, and language. The line becomes a way to trace one's trajectory and symbiosis throughout their existence.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/bGeIRVeKDIsXRIfpR8DgEFtRIO9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Neo-Neon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2322131,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiba Ali","original_name":"Hiba Ali","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6100f46e43999b005c095914","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2322131,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiba Ali","original_name":"Hiba Ali","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6100f4760d5d8500474017dc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bGeIRVeKDIsXRIfpR8DgEFtRIO9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
