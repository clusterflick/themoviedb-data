His only difference is his wheelchair. He grew up with his mother, Nina. The arrival of Vincent, a new kid in school, will change a lot of things for Sam. He will make Sam realize the injustice surrounding him and his group of friends: Lila (with Asperger syndrome) and Tom (death). Together, they 'll create a gang to denounce the lack of consideration they endure every day. Far from feeling like victims, they hope to raise awareness by striking hard.","popularity":0.3839,"poster_path":"/zfXso1T88eBtKOnB14ZchSLVoyv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Handigang","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Handi-Gang","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2698048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Théo Curin","original_name":"Théo Curin","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/4Jb8ZgYhH4CD73HrioDjCU3BFez.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sam Belek","credit_id":"60ffd7654e52ed0048b8ef70","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2695966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alessandra Sublet","original_name":"Alessandra Sublet","popularity":0.3101,"profile_path":"/rbKgkebYjFo8NPveWo2eZ6Io5MP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Nina","credit_id":"60ffd77e33ec2600467dae7e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruno Wolkowitch","original_name":"Bruno Wolkowitch","popularity":0.2423,"profile_path":"/aUAf498UK24tQRTzHpwaiFlb4O9.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Monsieur Giraudier","credit_id":"60ffd9a733ec26005ded7108","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":562158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samira Lachhab","original_name":"Samira Lachhab","popularity":0.3357,"profile_path":"/wzlDQ5c98NrscrjH0GJvBLm92b1.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Betty","credit_id":"6255af546082eb0e2592e310","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1968570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esther Valding","original_name":"Esther Valding","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":"/u4AgyhMzx6TQRv7kMHYVPshmx2Z.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Manon","credit_id":"6255af93aaec710e677e2602","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3618858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angèle Rohé","original_name":"Angèle Rohé","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Lila","credit_id":"62cb053d9566580f7b50d72e","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2220424,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Marine Gacem","original_name":"Marine Gacem","popularity":0.0402,"profile_path":"/xQB5FZTmYcYGbRL1PhIZmRlwqqe.jpg","credit_id":"6255aef70dea6e004f73c231","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1417355,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stéphanie Pillonca","original_name":"Stéphanie Pillonca","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":"/ydgmR7JSgqLW1y3Qvc8B3kfdQOk.jpg","credit_id":"60ffd74433ec26007440a1e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2124271,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Fabien Bouillaud","original_name":"Fabien Bouillaud","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/xXpB0ZD6ZOoSTjhX1W0e5QsRvDd.jpg","credit_id":"65f1ab31fa404601851126f4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":71931,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hugues Poulain","original_name":"Hugues Poulain","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f1ab38fa404601851126ff","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt19830652","wikidata_id":"Q111722141","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v4QSGndrBYlcxHof2A2PjaDZbZj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.662,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/zfXso1T88eBtKOnB14ZchSLVoyv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":715},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7kYXToE2Tcp1WDoB46l0BaghC6n.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/r4eHA2d2bh5fjFluitMtOH8CnXK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"TF1","release_date":"2022-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
