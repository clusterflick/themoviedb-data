At the centre of this swirl is world renowned dub poet Mutabaruka, possessed of one of the most trenchant tongues in Jamaica. In this fast-paced portrait co-directed by Canadian poet Lillian Allen, he brings his wit and sharp intelligence to some of his favourite subjects-tourism, Marcus Garvey, true Rastafari, and fast food as chemical warfare. Both in performance and interview, his liberation lessons, comic asides and dubwise Rastafarian philosophy cut hard to the bone.\" - Cameron Bailey","popularity":0.1126,"poster_path":"/d0iP0F7CFIC5HBLV6MSr1GfgCNu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"JM","name":"Jamaica"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blakk wi Blak...k...k","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1052213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mutabaruka","original_name":"Mutabaruka","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6100fbf41b7294005dd74c98","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3175584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lillian Allen","original_name":"Lillian Allen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6100fc071b7294005dd74c9f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3175585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giovanni Samprogna","original_name":"Giovanni Samprogna","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6100fc151b7294002f6bfc82","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0143142","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d0iP0F7CFIC5HBLV6MSr1GfgCNu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
