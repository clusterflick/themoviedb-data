In this unique fusion of dance and video, Streb performed on a raked platform between two large screens showing different sets of video images. Streb portrays a mythological creature in the process of evolution, moving from water to earth to sky â€” an amphibious entity in a struggle to defy gravity. Lucier's intuitive landscapes integrate with Streb's athletic choreography to create an abstract yet visceral performance space.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/bQGuJ2cedypCMUVwPQWLR1u2oIx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amphibian","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288715,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Streb","original_name":"Elizabeth Streb","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"60fec268f8595800271cb72f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2611259,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mary Lucier","original_name":"Mary Lucier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60fec49938e5100045cdbdf6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bQGuJ2cedypCMUVwPQWLR1u2oIx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
