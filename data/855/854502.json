While crossing Bolivia, on their way to Cuzco, they discovered the city of Potosi. 29 years later, they return to the same places, this time with their three daughters and a Super 16 camera. A road movie, which is both a depiction in real time of Potosi and the Andes and a journey of introspection for the filmmaker and his family. Potosi, at an altitude of 4,100 metres, was once one of the largest and richest cities in the world. But for the millions of indigenous people who were forced to work in the depths of the mountain, Potosi was the gateway to Hell. After its silver mines were exhausted, Potosi was abandoned, poor and forgotten. As in his previous film, Fragments - Jerusalem, Ron Havilio also uses personal material to draw a portrait of an Israeli family on the road, the generation gap, and a meditation on the passage of time.","popularity":0.0922,"poster_path":"/sGh3BCpGUuHfB6PEo1VVsSqd5HE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":207,"logo_path":"/uskenzq65wJe0cT0D8StQI3hJnO.png","name":"Agat Films & Cie / Ex Nihilo","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2006-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":426,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Potosi: The Journey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1448359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ron Havilio","original_name":"Ron Havilio","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"60ff26d7f10a1a0080e7fed5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3173723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacqueline Havilio","original_name":"Jacqueline Havilio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"60ff26e1f8595800613ae38d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1448359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ron Havilio","original_name":"Ron Havilio","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ff2441a5890200744c4215","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1448359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ron Havilio","original_name":"Ron Havilio","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ff2451ffc9de002f1135d9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1448359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ron Havilio","original_name":"Ron Havilio","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ff245a7304b5002db76e83","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1448359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ron Havilio","original_name":"Ron Havilio","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ff2466f85958008315d5b6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1448359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ron Havilio","original_name":"Ron Havilio","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ff24747304b5007e2b5da8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":991466,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Patrick Sobelman","original_name":"Patrick Sobelman","popularity":0.0664,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ff2485568463007f1be8e4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3173707,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mela Márquez","original_name":"Mela Márquez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ff24922fdec6005de1a648","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3173710,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Naomi Havilio","original_name":"Naomi Havilio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ff24a04142910046b180b2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0969319","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1856,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gHOyckyOLkRtsdoGKumE3PBQEH0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3301}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sGh3BCpGUuHfB6PEo1VVsSqd5HE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1198}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
