We follow Jorge through a journey full of omens, where reality and magical thinking blend together, as he discovers that the myth of wealth is built on sacrifices that become ever more tangible – while the boundaries between victims and oppressors get progressively vague and blurred. Mother Lode is a fable about the banality of the descent to hell in times of neoliberalism; it is a paradigm of a relentless world in which everything can be sacrificed in the name of profit.","popularity":0.1168,"poster_path":"/lgT8MyLblqZSDvGDV9MD4Qg13C4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137482,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wendigo Films","origin_country":""},{"id":150784,"logo_path":null,"name":"Malfè film","origin_country":""},{"id":110043,"logo_path":null,"name":"C-Side Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2023-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mother Lode","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"La Mine du diable - En camino a la Rinconada","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1340610,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Enrico Giovannone","original_name":"Enrico Giovannone","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60fdd1d7a5046e00239335f9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3172035,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matteo Tortone","original_name":"Matteo Tortone","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60fdd1961684f7002e0f7659","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3172035,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matteo Tortone","original_name":"Matteo Tortone","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60fdd1a43103250046d7a349","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171401,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Patrick Tresch","original_name":"Patrick Tresch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60fdd1af0fb398005d8e4c14","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288216,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexis Taillant","original_name":"Alexis Taillant","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60fdd1fed7fbda00451ebc4c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2215315,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Benjamin Poumey","original_name":"Benjamin Poumey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60fdd27c8e8d300045bd7f1a","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1863509,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mathieu Granier","original_name":"Mathieu Granier","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60fdd1bb85c0a2002024124b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2737313,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Baptiste Madry","original_name":"Jean-Baptiste Madry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60fdd1e92fdec60045ef9480","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15099978","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e9hvF0UOPkrn1K7WhfzdpiKY114.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/lgT8MyLblqZSDvGDV9MD4Qg13C4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Venice International Film Critics' Week","release_date":"2021-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"MOTHER LODE (2021) - Documentary - HD Trailer - English Subtitles","key":"BhN_SYkCWbE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-08-31T13:00:05.000Z","id":"612e7858c490480062596be3"}]}}}
