She conveys these with a storytelling style and a frankness that is distinctly West Indian. A tape about memory, oral history, and autobiography, My Mother's Place interweaves interviews, personal narrative, home movies, and verité footage of the Caribbean to explore the formation of race, class, and gender under colonialism.","popularity":0.0423,"poster_path":"/euoSpXglCv9kJShQ44p5XvrPaxB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Mother’s Place","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3526127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rita Fung","original_name":"Rita Fung","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"62696e1b614c6d0050652ff7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1302855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Fung","original_name":"Richard Fung","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/6sVJR9nb4rE9tISZH32USSprk9i.jpg","credit_id":"5896213b9251415a5b00908e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/euoSpXglCv9kJShQ44p5XvrPaxB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
