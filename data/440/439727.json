Director Karen Shopsowitz weaves the history of home movies together with footage shot by her father--amateur filmmaker Israel Shopsowitz. Equipped with her dad's old Super 8 camera, Karen traces the history of home movies from the 1920s through to the amateur explosion of the '30s and '40s and beyond. She interviews a lively line-up of scholars and collectors, such as early members of the Toronto Film Club, a Japanese-American archivist who sees home movies as an expression of cultural diversity and a collector who hosts popular Webcasts that highlight new acquisitions.","popularity":0.2747,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Father's Camera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1733632,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Antonin Lhotsky","original_name":"Antonin Lhotsky","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b5d18ed144430041387fa8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1261493,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Silva Basmajian","original_name":"Silva Basmajian","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5897666ec3a36808a501a5f3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1751264,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Karen Shopsowitz","original_name":"Karen Shopsowitz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58976660c3a36808a501a5ee","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1751264,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Karen Shopsowitz","original_name":"Karen Shopsowitz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"589766589251412e1901abca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0284333","wikidata_id":"Q123287384","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10887,"name":"home movie footage"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
