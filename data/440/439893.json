Rather than just a report on poverty, this is a universal story of people experiencing everyday events with a mixture of humor, irritation, weariness, and courage. Cora and Celso make a living selling cigarettes at night outside a downtown hotel in defiance of City regulations. The film follows their lives over a three-month period, beginning with Cora's attempt to find a new room for the family after they have been evicted from their previous home. Later, Celso and Cora face a crisis in their own relationship aggravated by the stresses of their daily life.","popularity":0.0505,"poster_path":"/uVaSwYtU4ERge4SSFVSwuDNJMvn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16577,"logo_path":"/qildaLRTmB6fCBM3H7L02nQCreO.png","name":"Ronin Films","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":417,"logo_path":"/w7d3hoHQaC0XwjrxEG1yPeuUhu5.png","name":"Australian Film Commission","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":86193,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canadian Filmmakers' Distribution Centre","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":4095,"logo_path":"/zR0M1hMBNRKyYnRHMidK9WjUsUX.png","name":"First Run Features","origin_country":"US"},{"id":76975,"logo_path":null,"name":"Icarus Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1983-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Celso and Cora","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"Celso and Cora: A Manila Story","type":"Video"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary Kildea","original_name":"Gary Kildea","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5897a99cc3a368771d0004e8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary Kildea","original_name":"Gary Kildea","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5897a985c3a368771d0004d8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary Kildea","original_name":"Gary Kildea","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5897a991c3a3687715000540","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary Kildea","original_name":"Gary Kildea","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5897a97c9251417a7c000579","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1161407","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uVaSwYtU4ERge4SSFVSwuDNJMvn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tl","note":"Sydney Film Festival","release_date":"1983-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tl","note":"Edinburgh International Film Festival","release_date":"1983-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tl","note":"London Film Festival","release_date":"1983-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tl","note":"Festival dei Popoli, Florence","release_date":"1983-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tl","note":"Chicago International Film Festival","release_date":"1983-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
