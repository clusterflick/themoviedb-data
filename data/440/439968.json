The event was headlined by two of the world's top Welterweights. Bellator champion Andrey Koreshkov met former champion Bellator Douglas Lima in a rematch in the main event. Koreshkov won the welterweight title with a unanimous decision victory over Lima at Bellator 140. He defended the belt earlier this year with a dominant win over former UFC lightweight champion Benson Henderson at Bellator 153. Lima won the vacant welterweight title with a second-round TKO of Rick Hawn at Bellator 117. After a lengthy layoff, he fought Koreshkov and lost via unanimous decision. After his loss to Koreshkov, he was out for a full year, but came back in July to defeat Paul Daley at Bellator 158.","popularity":0.0503,"poster_path":"/megQIKXSt9eFn8InzSz8fAvE72T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bellator 164: Koreshkov vs. Lima 2","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Bellator 164","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1044193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Douglas Lima","original_name":"Douglas Lima","popularity":0.08,"profile_path":"/3VhYgNqMi87vm1f2wbo3g0Z5j9l.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5897faba9251417a8e00435d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1347601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrey Koreshkov","original_name":"Andrey Koreshkov","popularity":0.0967,"profile_path":"/u5wP2uFA3AFVQaeEMTumM5HvDIi.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5897fac0c3a3687712003e4e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1751914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noad Lahat","original_name":"Noad Lahat","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5897fac59251417a7c00421f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1207679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgi Karakhanyan","original_name":"Georgi Karakhanyan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/kCf9WQ7MeRKHycsX9nK8BkLAOkP.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5897fad49251417a85004001","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1751916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kirill Medvedovsky","original_name":"Kirill Medvedovsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5897fada9251417a880040fb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1751917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lena Ovchynnikova","original_name":"Lena Ovchynnikova","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5897fadf9251417a8500400d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1751918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karla Benitez","original_name":"Karla Benitez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5897fae59251417a8e004376","order":6}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/megQIKXSt9eFn8InzSz8fAvE72T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
