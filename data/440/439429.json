His last major undertaking was hosting the NATO summit in 2002 and Němec was granted extraordinary access to film it. Set to make a “special poetic film”, it took Němec years to process what he had witnessed – George W. Bush creating an alliance to invade Iraq. It may then be the director’s revenge to point his camera lens democratically at everyone involved with the summit, giving the same screen time to kitchen and waiting staff, musicians, security detail and NATO protesters, as to the heads of states and attending dignitaries. Havel however, became as much of a subject as the president on screen, and the film’s narrator, providing commentary in his own voice from the distance of a few years after he left the office.","popularity":0.0821,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":114926,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jan Němec - Film","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2008-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heart Above the Castle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1024901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Němec","original_name":"Jan Němec","popularity":0.0606,"profile_path":"/90h9qsnwPUqN89BeGcRJfcINk0w.jpg","credit_id":"58966cb4925141294a00ced8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1024901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Němec","original_name":"Jan Němec","popularity":0.0606,"profile_path":"/90h9qsnwPUqN89BeGcRJfcINk0w.jpg","credit_id":"5d0b7f330e0a263793ca6539","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1041321,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michal Pavlíček","original_name":"Michal Pavlíček","popularity":0.1343,"profile_path":"/njRykN4g2NAcsu6LIqwhIC8jbm3.jpg","credit_id":"5d0b80a09251413e9fb8d711","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1082423,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ivo Špalj","original_name":"Ivo Špalj","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":"/dGLn61ee2Xn8705PX5NiVi4uNvU.jpg","credit_id":"5d0b81530e0a263296ca5e38","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1024901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Němec","original_name":"Jan Němec","popularity":0.0606,"profile_path":"/90h9qsnwPUqN89BeGcRJfcINk0w.jpg","credit_id":"5d0b81a10e0a263296ca5e7f","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2342900,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Karel Cudlín","original_name":"Karel Cudlín","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d0b80e5c3a368063a1e833d","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2244177,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Iva Ruszeláková","original_name":"Iva Ruszeláková","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d0b817e0e0a2649bdca5e66","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1024901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Němec","original_name":"Jan Němec","popularity":0.0606,"profile_path":"/90h9qsnwPUqN89BeGcRJfcINk0w.jpg","credit_id":"5d0b8126c3a3687e911ec61f","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1648215,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jiří Maxa","original_name":"Jiří Maxa","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d0b80ef0e0a2614f1ca6750","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1026854,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Petr Marek","original_name":"Petr Marek","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":"/xTgg4tbba5UPJayoLqRBLpnBFWu.jpg","credit_id":"5d0b8115c3a36865b01e8e05","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1362615,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Karel Slach","original_name":"Karel Slach","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d0b81330e0a26333bca57d5","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2315908,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Šimon Špidla","original_name":"Šimon Špidla","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d0b81439251413945b90181","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ČT2","release_date":"2008-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
