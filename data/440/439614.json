The horrors of rural life in Colombia with all its morality have done nothing but increase the power of this solitary soul. Shunned from birth, from the womb, she has found in the secrets she holds, in her love of animals, in the labyrinth of her faith, a way of dealing with a world that has done nothing but despite her for reasons beyond her control, reasons that have victimized her from the start. But our Miss is as mighty as a stalk of wheat, impervious even to earthquakes, and although she has known much sorrow, there is none powerful enough to exhaust her tears or wipe away her smile.","popularity":0.0605,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"2017-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miss María, Skirting the Mountain","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","title":"Señorita María Luisa: la falda de la montaña","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CO","title":"Señorita María Luysa: la falda de la montaña","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1751058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"María Luisa Fuentes Burgos","original_name":"María Luisa Fuentes Burgos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"58973c879251412e14018577","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1181027,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rubén Mendoza","original_name":"Rubén Mendoza","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/n7xGHDVfPSrpldbwswvT57ZrZlS.jpg","credit_id":"58973b06c3a368627c015102","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1181027,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rubén Mendoza","original_name":"Rubén Mendoza","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/n7xGHDVfPSrpldbwswvT57ZrZlS.jpg","credit_id":"58973b94c3a36808980197b7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1779404,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Amanda Sarmiento","original_name":"Amanda Sarmiento","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58cdd3aac3a36850c0010d1d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1181027,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rubén Mendoza","original_name":"Rubén Mendoza","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/n7xGHDVfPSrpldbwswvT57ZrZlS.jpg","credit_id":"58cdd3b89251415a8b01317f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1181027,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rubén Mendoza","original_name":"Rubén Mendoza","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/n7xGHDVfPSrpldbwswvT57ZrZlS.jpg","credit_id":"58cdd3c99251415a61013d0f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7197576","wikidata_id":"Q61937847","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/okeExgpjpocfDdTHaqm7Yn7kgiK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival Internacional de Cine de Cartagena de Indias","release_date":"2017-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
