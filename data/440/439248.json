There is a row with the new engineer Michel the evening after the first trip. He leaves - out of jealousy. Instead of him, Marianne takes three funny musicians with her who are looking for work. The trip to Hamburg on the Elbe initially ends on a sandbank, from which another barge, the \"Petrel\", frees them. Michel has now been hired there. After a few complications and pointless fights, because Marianne has long been in love with Michel, there is the well-deserved happy ending.","popularity":0.1609,"poster_path":"/3Ix0HX5QfFcxcjBmnn8gUTL3eB6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":602,"logo_path":"/pVsXRFbYVDe5BhsATCAh1rt5F0k.png","name":"DEFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East
