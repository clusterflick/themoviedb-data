Mexican activist Gustavo Castro, a witness to the crime, survived the horror of that night and was trapped in Honduras. The defense of the river Gualcarque, sacred to the Lenca people, against the installation of a hydroelectric plant, is the preamble of a story in which we follow Garifuna leader Miriam Miranda, friend and companion of Berta. Their struggle for decolonization is the same, in a country that is sold to transnational capital and takes lives in many ways.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":67156,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oxfam","origin_country":""},{"id":83562,"logo_path":null,"name":"Terco Producciones","origin_country":""},{"id":86124,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tercer Piso","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Berta Vive","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1711221,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katia Lara","original_name":"Katia Lara","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58951b4dc3a36808a5003311","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
