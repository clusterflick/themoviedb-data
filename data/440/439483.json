Nearly breaking up the two sweethearts, Coppélia is not what she seems and Swanhilda decides to teach Franz a lesson…  The Bolshoi’s unique version of Coppélia exhibits a fascinating reconstruction of the original 19th century choreography of this ebullient comedy involving a feisty heroine, a boyish fiancee with a wandering eye, and an old dollmaker. The company’s stunning corps de ballet shines in the divertissements and famous “dance of the hours,” and its principals abound in youthful energy and irresistible humor in this effervescent production.","popularity":0.5858,"poster_path":"/yWB1ewdCHb9grpI5fJHnpc0hEdp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":165061,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bolshoi Opera and Ballet
