Ravett reflects upon his relationships with his family, from his now-deceased father (who survived both the Lodz Ghetto and Auschwitz) to his own young children. He utilizes family photographs and film footage, archival film footage from the Ghetto Fighters' House in Israel, cell animation by Emily Hubley, and computer graphics to create a film about memory, death, and what critic Bruce Jenkins calls \"the power of the photographic image and sound to resurrect the past.\"","popularity":0.2174,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Yiddish","iso_639_1":"yi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everything's for You","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486532,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abraham Ravett","original_name":"Abraham Ravett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"589633aac3a368089f00e413","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0097304","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":154866,"name":"archive footage"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
