Because that’s where the world has ended up – humans thirsting for endless lives and shadowy businessmen and dealmakers taking advantage of this hunger. Set to original music by Němec’s student and fellow filmmaker Petr Marek and his band Midi Lidi, the rich soundscape of the film creates a distinct counterpart to the freewheeling visuals shot digitally in 3D. The former Czech president Václav Havel makes an appearance in the film recalling a script he wrote in the 1960s with Němec, his distant cousin, which the present film utilises as a reflecting surface.","popularity":0.2289,"poster_path":"/q8Htk2IUMmJOqH7G7V9aZmvaErJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114926,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jan Němec - Film","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2010-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heart Beat 3D","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":136811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan Budař","original_name":"Jan Budař","popularity":0.1992,"profile_path":"/2oQBS4isjpRFaxoz0YsbhYQxQAU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5c695f590e0a262fa1a01699","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karel Roden","original_name":"Karel Roden","popularity":0.4837,"profile_path":"/zfxaI9n2kjlDyJUpSFvawQGV1Hg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c695f610e0a261777969f3c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1024901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Němec","original_name":"Jan Němec","popularity":0.0606,"profile_path":"/90h9qsnwPUqN89BeGcRJfcINk0w.jpg","credit_id":"58966a4fc3a36822e000c369","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":579477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Václav Havel","original_name":"Václav Havel","popularity":0.2566,"profile_path":"/AjP5JnL8f8st6jtmrHJapg0QINK.jpg","credit_id":"5c695f70c3a3684fabe2eb7b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1024901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Němec","original_name":"Jan Němec","popularity":0.0606,"profile_path":"/90h9qsnwPUqN89BeGcRJfcINk0w.jpg","credit_id":"5c695f769251412fc40777a0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6474440","wikidata_id":"Q12019333","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"cs","file_path":"/q8Htk2IUMmJOqH7G7V9aZmvaErJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cs","note":"","release_date":"2010-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
