While borrowing library books for research on another project, Kalin discovered, glued to the endpapers, ordinary \"due date\" ledgers stamped with dates spanning three decades. Inspired by these tiny ledgers—like skin or palimpsests that recorded an analogue history, an accumulation of many gestures—Kalin combines quotidian pictures snatched from his daily life with an evocative musical track by ongoing collaborator Doveman (Thomas Bartlett). The film layers dates and moments from Kalin's personal world with the public and global history of AIDS.  Commissioned by Visual AIDS in 2014 as part of ALTERNATE ENDINGS, a program of seven videos that bring together charged moments and personal memories amidst the public history of HIV/AIDS.","popularity":0.085,"poster_path":"/sNpS08FMZvmoNmnAJEqpbfh1R2P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ashes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Kalin","original_name":"Tom Kalin","popularity":0.0997,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5895f9f6c3a36808ae00a3af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5080451,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Visual AIDS","original_name":"Visual AIDS","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674a1b8d68a603b06a392020","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sNpS08FMZvmoNmnAJEqpbfh1R2P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
