Set in a beautifully black-and-white filmed Newfoundland, it is the story of a rivalry between two seal hunters that plays out on the ice floes during a hunt. Unsatisfied with the first cut, Frissell arranged for the crew to accompany an actual Newfoundland seal hunt on The SS Viking, on which an explosion of dynamite (carried regularly at the time on Arctic ships to combat ice jams) killed many members of the crew, including Frissell. The film was renamed in honor of the dead.","popularity":0.6361,"poster_path":"/1O3rA7TaK4FR7iMhYnd5HNVjF6K.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1931-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Actually produced during the Great Newfoundland Seal Hunt and You see the REAL thing","title":"The Viking","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"White Thunder","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Starrett","original_name":"Charles Starrett","popularity":0.2938,"profile_path":"/7DhidPyO8Z3regVeobzhRcbqlZT.jpg","cast_id":1004,"character":"Luke Oarum","credit_id":"52fe4a269251416c750df633","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1037770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Huntington","original_name":"Louise Huntington","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/703y6tR8Zjw53GQjeYeUub9grT4.jpg","cast_id":1005,"character":"Mary Joe","credit_id":"52fe4a269251416c750df637","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Vinton","original_name":"Arthur Vinton","popularity":0.1047,"profile_path":"/c1grd7bdC09yAGLIMnZR1KY00ra.jpg","cast_id":1006,"character":"Jed Nelson","credit_id":"52fe4a269251416c750df63b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1037771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Bartlett","original_name":"Bob Bartlett","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1007,"character":"Captain Barker (as Captain Bob Bartlett)","credit_id":"52fe4a269251416c750df63f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1416156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilfred Grenfell","original_name":"Wilfred Grenfell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1008,"character":"Prologue Speaker","credit_id":"54be7ddc92514148b000a9ad","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1037769,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Varick Frissell","original_name":"Varick Frissell","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a269251416c750df61d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931194,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Melford","original_name":"George Melford","popularity":0.2426,"profile_path":"/aV70vLKnT7p3mVk1CehvMIXq7T1.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4a269251416c750df623","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1018951,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Garnett Weston","original_name":"Garnett Weston","popularity":0.0573,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a269251416c750df629","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1018951,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Garnett Weston","original_name":"Garnett Weston","popularity":0.0573,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a269251416c750df62f","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1037769,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Varick Frissell","original_name":"Varick Frissell","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec17f468e2e00001f1588e3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2642458,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roy P.
