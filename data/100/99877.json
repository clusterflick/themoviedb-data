The film - using a blend of cinema verit√© and characters' voice over - offers a raw, intimate, and even uplifting look at how patients, executive staff and caregivers each cope with disease, bureaucracy and hard choices. It is a film about fighting for survival when the odds are stacked against you.","popularity":0.2118,"poster_path":"/sgkewSYT4hM4mMY3HzhLk4m0IME.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"One Hospital, Hundreds of stories","title":"The Waiting Room","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":17,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1088686,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Nicks","original_name":"Peter Nicks","popularity":0.1045,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a459251416c750e36eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1618399","wikidata_id":"Q7773234","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sgkewSYT4hM4mMY3HzhLk4m0IME.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
