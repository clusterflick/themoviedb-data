Following heart failure in 1997, his life took a dramatic turn. He was pronounced clinically dead and brought back to life with jolts of electricity. He was in a coma for several weeks and, when he woke up, he turned out to be physically and mentally handicapped. In this way, at the age of 39, Tobias found himself in a wheelchair and was no longer able to talk as a result of his brain damage. From that moment on, playing the cello was a thing of the past.","popularity":0.0588,"poster_path":"/5YIQVGzzt5DfhuvTM6ue2WVgb6N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30425,"logo_path":null,"name":"Selfmade Films","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2006-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ik wil nooit beroemd worden","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2318843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tobias Prenen","original_name":"Tobias Prenen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1001,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ce576f30e0a26381ccfa536","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2318844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolf Nottrot","original_name":"Rudolf Nottrot","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1002,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ce5771cc3a3684511254910","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2318845,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Prenen","original_name":"Paul Prenen","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/phY1MvUA9Eh1VmDEbNMfssUwieY.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ce577320e0a26426acae4c1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2318846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cilia Prenen","original_name":"Cilia Prenen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1004,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5ce577440e0a265779cd39f2","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1021530,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mercedes Stalenhoef","original_name":"Mercedes Stalenhoef","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a3a9251416c750e1f0d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":557648,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Peter Brugman","original_name":"Peter Brugman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce577800e0a265779cd3b21","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1553152,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Erik van Empel","original_name":"Erik van Empel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce57791c3a3686494214823","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168194,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gys Zevenbergen","original_name":"Gys Zevenbergen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce577a0c3a368649421482b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1712173,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marc Lizier","original_name":"Marc Lizier","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce577ca0e0a26381ccfa7c0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":54261,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michel Schöpping","original_name":"Michel Schöpping","popularity":0.0723,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce577dec3a3686a1c214a51","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2318847,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bouwe Moulder","original_name":"Bouwe Moulder","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce577f40e0a26522acd2f37","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0819899","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1132,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/5YIQVGzzt5DfhuvTM6ue2WVgb6N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"IDFA (International Documentary Film Festival)","release_date":"2005-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
