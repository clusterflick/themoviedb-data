He and his Church of Satan are shown performing a black mass, in which a nude woman serves as an altar and a boa constrictor wraps itself around a naked witch. Newsreel footage is included in which LaVey's neighbors are interviewed about the lion which he kept in his house until complaints resulted in the animal's removal to a zoo. The ideology of the Church of Satan is discussed--guilt rejection, sexual freedom, and self-indulgence.","popularity":0.4387,"poster_path":"/4Zi9oh13UVd0mZdJv7LzaHDqAmA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1970-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Satanis: The Devil's Mass","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Succubus","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1684352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isaac Bonewits","original_name":"Isaac Bonewits","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/xZGAEsfliGAAlvsIq6fuyamrfJg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"57e688f7925141298700821e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anton LaVey","original_name":"Anton LaVey","popularity":0.2452,"profile_path":"/4ViP5lpbBOaHY1WPqbuAK8r8Beh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"57e68900c3a368220e007410","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1684353,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diane LaVey","original_name":"Diane LaVey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"57e6890cc3a3683525007390","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3868460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Togare","original_name":"Togare","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"63bf2e7823be4600b2f0595e","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1183228,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ray Laurent","original_name":"Ray Laurent","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a379251416c750e1925","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1183228,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ray Laurent","original_name":"Ray Laurent","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a253ac092514103360d9e46","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1934782,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sean Erik","original_name":"Sean Erik","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a253af192514103360d9e88","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1171817,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Richard Eisman","original_name":"Richard Eisman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a253b03c3a3680b880db584","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1934783,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Carlon Tanner","original_name":"Carlon Tanner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a253b0ec3a3680b960d842c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0063550","wikidata_id":"Q7425926","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4Zi9oh13UVd0mZdJv7LzaHDqAmA.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nte1sPwit49STy5TdJMopML4gwo.jpg","vote_average":8.034,"vote_count":5,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yLC3grgiiisRVk4RYN9m8oEjsxA.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":582,"name":"san francisco, california"},{"id":3099,"name":"satanism"},{"id":5545,"name":"satanist"},{"id":161214,"name":"black mass"},{"id":229528,"name":"church of satan"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"SATANIS: THE DEVIL'S MASS [Official Theatrical Trailer - AGFA]","key":"fIW7fI6lUCw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2019-05-31T16:36:46.000Z","id":"5e0838929bcd0f001713073b"}]}}}
