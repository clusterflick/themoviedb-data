Most of the inmates cultivate the pre-existing relationships with the concubines or partners who live outside the prison walls. Though, there is a special category, of those who find a life partner during their time in prison.  VISITING ROOM follows the stories of some prisoners found in different penitentiaries across the country, who have found their life partner during their sentence time. The one is either a person from outside, or as them, a person who is serving time in prison. Our intention was to talk to the people found in the special situation of being deprived of freedom, to whom love becomes a substitute for freedom and represents maybe their only hope for a better future.","popularity":0.1357,"poster_path":"/8nKQqEiHmK0Ciujfl773QhRkJ3E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2011-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Visiting Room","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1011109,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexandru Baciu","original_name":"Alexandru Baciu","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a379251416c750e1863","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129564,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Radu Muntean","original_name":"Radu Muntean","popularity":0.0585,"profile_path":"/8w488NkXm2jbdbeLoRpdU9ZREpo.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4a379251416c750e1869","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1488671,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrei Cretulescu","original_name":"Andrei Cretulescu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/iJUCMabeTGL7b93kYLaWyo3cDzc.jpg","credit_id":"63639a4b2b2108007900f885","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2852460,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carmen Harabagiu","original_name":"Carmen Harabagiu","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63639a750c3ec800790836ce","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":965600,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tudor Lucaciu","original_name":"Tudor Lucaciu","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63639abad75bd6007e722c28","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2072961,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diana Vidrascu","original_name":"Diana Vidrascu","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/7TYuV1wQbrOHBIq2IxbBHS63t0Z.jpg","credit_id":"63639ad907e281007a9d8b06","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1545739,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andu Radu","original_name":"Andu Radu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63639ae85ca704007ac1ae19","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1545744,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gelu Costache","original_name":"Gelu Costache","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63639b04091e62008795eb65","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2471359,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Soare","original_name":"Daniel Soare","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63639b19d207f3007cdd0831","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1346938,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stanomir Dragoş","original_name":"Stanomir Dragoş","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63639b3b0c3ec8007e50297d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2505204,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Florin Sora","original_name":"Florin Sora","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63639b5becbde9007aa5359f","department":"Sound","job":"Boom Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1011109,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexandru Baciu","original_name":"Alexandru Baciu","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c465e8e0e0a26494dc84dba","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129564,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Radu Muntean","original_name":"Radu Muntean","popularity":0.0585,"profile_path":"/8w488NkXm2jbdbeLoRpdU9ZREpo.jpg","credit_id":"5c465e940e0a26495ac865a1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2140645","wikidata_id":"Q23828236","facebook_id":"Vorbitor","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":"ro","file_path":"/8nKQqEiHmK0Ciujfl773QhRkJ3E.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
