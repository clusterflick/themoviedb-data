Believing that \"a man is measured by his enemies\", Harry Maloney (Colm Meany) sets out to ruin George O'Flaherty – the most powerful man in town, who not only owns the local pub and most of the businesses in the area, but is also the local matchmaker.

During this time, Harry quietly mobilizes his dastardly plans.","popularity":1.1482,"poster_path":"/8eELHgTY2j1jodHApO23jOTSV0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":393,"logo_path":"/5lf9uTroyzjNDOyu86qWV0eqIPc.png","name":"MACT Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":850,"logo_path":"/aF7qajGJGtMpdrtvssM9g90YanX.png","name":"Eurimages","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1898,"logo_path":"/8ix6SGlJiyuUDxLBtY8E0PY2G7w.png","name":"Fís Éireann/Screen Ireland","origin_country":"IE"},{"id":10102,"logo_path":"/hdJq0LbqmBx6FJqnfTtfqvAsAkV.png","name":"Cattleya","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":10379,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film and General Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":114831,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paradox Pictures","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2001-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How Harry Became a Tree","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":16,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"How Harry Became a Tree","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Il sogno di Harry","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colm Meaney","original_name":"Colm Meaney","popularity":1.4568,"profile_path":"/guL6RJdlRMtOJN3LoaY3G8hG4Rd.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Harry","credit_id":"52fe4a499251416c750e4081","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adrian Dunbar","original_name":"Adrian Dunbar","popularity":0.6309,"profile_path":"/AwiptVRftEIwXSM8C4izNVQtQL7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"George","credit_id":"52fe4a499251416c750e4085","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cillian Murphy","original_name":"Cillian Murphy","popularity":7.457,"profile_path":"/llkbyWKwpfowZ6C8peBjIV9jj99.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Gus","credit_id":"52fe4a499251416c750e4089","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":62105,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kerry Condon","original_name":"Kerry Condon","popularity":1.425,"profile_path":"/8RO25vJxQSoNdhsVbiAHOsiGfvl.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Eileen","credit_id":"52fe4a499251416c750e408d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":188468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pat Laffan","original_name":"Pat Laffan","popularity":0.2085,"profile_path":"/eBXRV2pCg0WThbyGUqAU0tpx2ob.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Father O'Connor","credit_id":"597f838b9251415d5d036b55","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1412876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gail Fitzpatrick","original_name":"Gail Fitzpatrick","popularity":0.2096,"profile_path":"/aiXb2EABZDJURuy9TUs0ofdnlAG.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Margaret","credit_id":"597f8396c3a368539703a8ef","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1861584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maighréad Ní Chonghaile","original_name":"Maighréad Ní Chonghaile","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Maeve","credit_id":"597f83a2c3a368539703a90b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":946148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Des Braiden","original_name":"Des Braiden","popularity":0.2201,"profile_path":"/mIBvhUeXlSxQuLPXhrNKQYrcV33.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"George's father","credit_id":"597f83adc3a368542e0389bf","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1549245,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Denis Clohessy","original_name":"Denis Clohessy","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Tim","credit_id":"597f83b8c3a368541703367b","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1861585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Clohessy","original_name":"Sean Clohessy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Sean","credit_id":"597f83c3c3a36854080390c7","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1597387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurie Morton","original_name":"Laurie Morton","popularity":0.0664,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Daisy","credit_id":"597f83cd9251415d610395fb","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1748940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gladys Sheehan","original_name":"Gladys Sheehan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Maisie","credit_id":"597f83dac3a36853dd031ee1","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1861586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph M.
