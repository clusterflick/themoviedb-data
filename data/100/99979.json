A cooperation with Greenpeace was already existent at this point and when the band returned to South America the next year, they happily intensified it. Kaus Meine, lead singer of the Scorpions, recollects, “Due to the unbelievable success we returned to Manaus in 2008, but we also played Rio, Sao Paulo and Recife again. During the show in Belem we accepted Greenpeace’s invitation to participate in a three-hour flight across the rainforest in order to get a picture of the proceeding destruction (an area twice the size of Germany has been destroyed by fire so far).","popularity":0.0822,"poster_path":"/y78cUFfSl2EXDkH7E4SmglDsaqq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2009-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Scorpions - Amazonia Live in the Jungle","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":213462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klaus Meine","original_name":"Klaus Meine","popularity":0.3032,"profile_path":"/xrohiYpNtvyMTQsUwVXr5g9uObj.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5d1704f15b4fed002146a870","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5260752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"greenpace","original_name":"greenpace","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b82dd15503292756225e27","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y78cUFfSl2EXDkH7E4SmglDsaqq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
