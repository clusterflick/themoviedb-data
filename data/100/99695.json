In little carts, men descend into the subterranean corridors. Beside an arrow on a wall is written ‘Zur Hölle’ (to hell). Deeper and deeper, the camera penetrates the interior of the earth, where darkness reigns and strange sounds of people and machines are distorted into a frightening cacophony. At the end of the day, the miners come back up, towards the daylight. There, they change and rinse the dust from their pores.","popularity":0.0864,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Untertage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":15461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jiska Rickels","original_name":"Jiska Rickels","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4578bb41465c0018d3c07c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0419235","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
