Calling for a delivery of noodles for lunch, but the delivery service is closed. Starting to cook udon noodles. A telephone dialling, a car ride. The noodles are cooked and people talk about Germany.

A pure focus on the conversations.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/yuP4qejDxXgeC7DzBPXyLPL9fGS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SCHWARZFILM MIT LICHTTON","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3760590,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Goh Harada","original_name":"Goh Harada","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635aecb335c30a007eaa8aab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yuP4qejDxXgeC7DzBPXyLPL9fGS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
