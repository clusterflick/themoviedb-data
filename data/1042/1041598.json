By explaining the cause of infectious diseases, the scientist also understood what the antidote to them should be: vaccination. Such was its success that this technique for stimulating the immune system has since become the standard-bearer of scientific medicine, to the point of drawing a dividing line between light and obscurantism, science and superstition. Nevertheless, vaccination cannot be exempt from all questioning. Does it act on the organism beyond protection against a disease? Do we know that the order in which vaccines are administered influences their effectiveness and their possible harmfulness? Should everyone be vaccinated? Do laboratories exploit fear?","popularity":0.045,"poster_path":"/px3nyxWty9V5zIg0YGneg4RV9te.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Of Vaccines and Men","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3777746,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne Georget","original_name":"Anne Georget","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a4986a5e14e500a78f11dc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22873980","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/px3nyxWty9V5zIg0YGneg4RV9te.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
