In its ambiguous mix of tenderness and aggression, A Prayer For Nettie extends the traditions of the grotesque and the absurd. The fervent prayers of the actors are undermined by indifference, forgetfulness, and the presence of the camera. In the end, comedy turns the tables on piety and remembrance as Nettie looks up from the grave.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/iaa8mfB0pcdVRJfpI1YrRxjQT6z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Prayer for Nettie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1927664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donigan Cumming","original_name":"Donigan Cumming","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/c8Qqi9ZLDga8DARrBx1AIh7RMo3.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Donigan","credit_id":"67b87cf97434200c282290c5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5261189,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geoffrey Bates","original_name":"Geoffrey Bates","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Geoff","credit_id":"67b87d0c444dd7fcefba76d1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5261188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerald Harvey","original_name":"Gerald Harvey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Gerry","credit_id":"67b87d1b550329275622779b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5261197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nelson Coombs","original_name":"Nelson Coombs","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Nelson","credit_id":"67b87d2b7434200c282290df","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5261199,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joyce Donnison","original_name":"Joyce Donnison","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Joyce","credit_id":"67b87d397434200c282290fc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2767628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nettie Harris","original_name":"Nettie Harris","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Nettie","credit_id":"67b87d4a7434200c2822910d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5261202,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Beaudoin","original_name":"Raymond Beaudoin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Raymond","credit_id":"67b87d5ca2284666f1eb61d6","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5261203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Ross Smith","original_name":"Albert Ross Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Albert","credit_id":"67b87d6da2284666f1eb61e7","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1927664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donigan Cumming","original_name":"Donigan Cumming","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/c8Qqi9ZLDga8DARrBx1AIh7RMo3.jpg","credit_id":"635b579b95c0af0098f67518","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1927664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donigan Cumming","original_name":"Donigan Cumming","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/c8Qqi9ZLDga8DARrBx1AIh7RMo3.jpg","credit_id":"67b63d4264def0053f145bde","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1927664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donigan Cumming","original_name":"Donigan Cumming","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/c8Qqi9ZLDga8DARrBx1AIh7RMo3.jpg","credit_id":"67b63d5164def0053f145be8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1927664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donigan Cumming","original_name":"Donigan Cumming","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/c8Qqi9ZLDga8DARrBx1AIh7RMo3.jpg","credit_id":"67b63d5b0dd22ec79c3add0b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1927664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donigan Cumming","original_name":"Donigan Cumming","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/c8Qqi9ZLDga8DARrBx1AIh7RMo3.jpg","credit_id":"67b63d682b0abc8c4d523cff","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":875,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iaa8mfB0pcdVRJfpI1YrRxjQT6z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
