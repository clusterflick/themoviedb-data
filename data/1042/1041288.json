DeDecker created a monument dedicated to the women who fought tirelessly to make it possible for women to vote and, at the time of filming, was working tirelessly to get the statue placed permanently in Washington DC. To help the cause, Merrell Footwear sent Trail Sisters founder Gina Lucrezi, and Merrell ambassadors Anna Frost and Mirna Valerio to Janeâ€™s studio in Loveland, Colorado.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ripple Effect","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
