Uwe Walter, a shakuhachi player from Germany, lives there with his wife Mitsuyo for 30 years. Together with the villagers he prepares the annual Gion Festival. On the eve of the festival, the village representatives tell him that his self-built studio is to be demolished. This brings back memories for him of earlier times and his first steps as a Nō actor.  In the manner of a fresco, the film interweaves rural depictions of everyday life with the story of its German protagonist. In the village community with its togetherness of generations, Uwe shares life with his neighbours, with farmers, hunters, woodsmen, poultry farmers and anglers, tills his kitchen garden, and like other tradition-conscious villagers, he also grows his rice. The film shows them in a harsh mountain landscape between the rainy season and the first snow.","popularity":0.5684,"poster_path":"/70hdifdnT0z58E8ivFtaAJ60StC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2023-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miyama, Kyōto Prefecture","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rainer Komers","original_name":"Rainer Komers","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/4Ewheviq176Qvj5b92PUafM51tM.jpg","credit_id":"635bef448289a0007e87612c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22493716","wikidata_id":"Q117600689","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7YyTgIRblw5tqn1SFwPEGeUYMta.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/70hdifdnT0z58E8ivFtaAJ60StC.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":548,"name":"countryside"},{"id":1842,"name":"village life"},{"id":18447,"name":"japanese woman"},{"id":161316,"name":"social documentary"},{"id":210455,"name":"small community"},{"id":213040,"name":"self reflection"},{"id":240847,"name":"social & cultural documentary"},{"id":255834,"name":"rural life"},{"id":279519,"name":"mountain life"},{"id":303334,"name":"community life"},{"id":313059,"name":"simple life"},{"id":314576,"name":"living in japan"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"International Leipzig Festival for Documentary and Animated Film","release_date":"2022-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Arte","release_date":"2024-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Arte","release_date":"2024-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Miyama, Kyoto Prefecture I Trailer english","key":"754293377","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-09-27T13:40:49.000Z","id":"635befade18e3f0090922bfd"}]}}}
