Seen in close-up fragments, television and video images from cinematic sources — Poltergeist, Videodrome, Network, The Candidate — and video art tapes are rendered as illegible, abstracted fields. Against this ground of scanlines and shadowy images, a series of isolated words — \"manipulation,\" \"context,\" \"audience,\" \"fragment\" — comprise an index of the tactics of the television apparatus, as well as Muntadas' (video's) reflexive strategies of critiquing the media. As Glenn Branca's tense musical score accelerates to a climax, the final video image, which depicts television sets in a consumer display, fragments and disintegrates.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Video is Television?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Videotape is Television","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2622507,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antoni Muntadas","original_name":"Antoni Muntadas","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635ad836d400f3007a56871c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
