When he opens his eyes, he notices the vibration of the chandelier and the furniture. In his mind, he tries different ways of escaping. A white moth is dying next to the insecticide; while the man is trying to save himself from the earthquake, the moth struggles to save himself too. The man, in his last thought, no longer decides to run away. He gets up slowly, goes to the kitchen, and drinks water. Then he returns to his bed and looks at the moth, who flutters his last wing and dies. He lies down, and the blood-colored sun shines on him.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2021-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ain't Our Fault","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3233721,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sahar Tarzi","original_name":"Sahar Tarzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635b7d3ffd63000079a83512","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12938116","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
