The regime has forgotten about such important concepts as freedom of opinion and human rights, the dictatorial regime sweeps away everything in its path. But freedom, first of all, is inside of us. This animation is a gesture of solidarity with all political prisoners in Belarus who were not afraid to tell the truth and are in prison now. The musician and animator of the film, in turn, also went to prison, after which this project was born.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tomorrow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3761182,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rita Tikhanovich","original_name":"Rita Tikhanovich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635b65e7e263bb007c23d2d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
