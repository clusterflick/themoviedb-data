Instead, they discover the truth behind what made these areas close their doors for good and illustrates what skiing used to be like before mega resorts and climate change wreaked havoc on independently owned ski areas.  Through heart-wrenching interviews with former owners, ski patrol, and historians, The Road West Traveled uncovers what it’s like to be a skier in Colorado's backcountry and what it means to go from lost to found.","popularity":0.1621,"poster_path":"/6CXOQd15tVUbjH7XxCpDlpVUEb4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":185117,"logo_path":"/65JRd40bcRMlBhVSXClNvK3hdkJ.png","name":"The Road West Traveled","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abandoned","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3761827,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sara Beam Robbins","original_name":"Sara Beam Robbins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635c0c4095c0af007a0fec94","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3761827,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sara Beam Robbins","original_name":"Sara Beam Robbins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635c0cfe0c3ec8007e4d12e4","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3761850,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Annette Bargas","original_name":"Annette Bargas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635c0d5a88c6590082377429","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3761834,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lio DelPiccolo","original_name":"Lio DelPiccolo","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635c0c810c3ec80090b41d8e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3761847,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grant Robbins","original_name":"Grant Robbins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635c0d3735c30a007eaafaf9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3761847,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grant Robbins","original_name":"Grant Robbins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635c0d26e263bb0090f4201c","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3761834,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lio DelPiccolo","original_name":"Lio DelPiccolo","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635c0c8ce263bb00799e3f61","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3761827,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sara Beam Robbins","original_name":"Sara Beam Robbins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635c0d0b1b7294008312706e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3761851,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jae McKeown","original_name":"Jae McKeown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635c0d7a35c30a0079ea9b50","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1msgc6r3OqwqHQE83NGScNk5Vl1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6CXOQd15tVUbjH7XxCpDlpVUEb4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1442,"name":"winter"},{"id":1981,"name":"colorado"},{"id":195732,"name":"ski"},{"id":248915,"name":"skiing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"World Premier, Oriental Theater, Denver, CO","release_date":"2018-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
