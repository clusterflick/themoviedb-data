Graffiti is not only scribbles or painted walls, for us it is an inseparable element of urban space, a lifestyle and, above all, the voice of our generation.  The aim of this documentary is not only to portray hundreds of actions on trains and walls, but also to show what influenced us while creating graffiti.  We want to talk about our passion through the prism of the city and dispel doubts - whether it is vandalism or art.  The material is a journey through the streets of Polish and European cities to the sounds of cans and hip hop.  The soundtrack to the film was created in cooperation  with Polish hip hop artists.","popularity":0.0905,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Szarancza (Locust) is a documentary film project about graffiti in \"Saint City\", eastern Europe.","title":"Szarańcza","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
