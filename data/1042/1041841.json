Set mostly in a university library, this political debate between a medical student, his 1770s ancestor, and a history professor is a sequel to the 1972 National Education Program film, Brink of Disaster! Two additional characters appear in this drama: a 19th-century steamboat captain, and the studentâ€™s grandfather - an early 20th-century automobile worker. The National Education Program at Harding College in Searcy, Arkansas created a variety of widely-distributed anti-communism films from the mid-1940s to the early 1970s.","popularity":0.2962,"poster_path":"/DFnZBm2AHZKeTn3GEl0Gn3VyFp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37652,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jerry Fairbanks Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Educating 1960s campus protesters as to \"what's right with America.\"","title":"Tragedy or Hope","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/DFnZBm2AHZKeTn3GEl0Gn3VyFp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":458,"name":"hippie"},{"id":2903,"name":"propaganda"},{"id":2106,"name":"cold war"},{"id":7059,"name":"anti-communism"},{"id":168483,"name":"student protest"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Tragedy or Hope (1972)","key":"UNCRBqnhE6o","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2011-08-08T13:41:54.000Z","id":"635d4ced63d937007f149417"}]}}}
