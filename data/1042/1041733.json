Muskotti, her mother, has such a bad memory that she doesn't know how old Mimosa is. Mimosa's birthday is a warm and fairytale-like film, but at the same time a sneaky story about a girl's growth into adulthood. It takes place entirely in a wizarding world awash with a night blue glow.","popularity":0.3227,"poster_path":"/8sNhUWyuTpHGElNumDhDprflvHX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1987-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mimosa's Birthnight","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Mimosas födelsenatt","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"L'anniversaire de Mimosa","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1244701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rabbe Smedlund","original_name":"Rabbe Smedlund","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator / Witches / The Crow / The Cats (voice)","credit_id":"635ceb0e95c0af0098f70d90","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3435326,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Camilla Mickwitz","original_name":"Camilla Mickwitz","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635ceb1f63d937007aac5474","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3435326,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Camilla Mickwitz","original_name":"Camilla Mickwitz","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635ceb25e263bb007c246e17","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3435326,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Camilla Mickwitz","original_name":"Camilla Mickwitz","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635ceb2d88c659008237c3bf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3435326,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Camilla Mickwitz","original_name":"Camilla Mickwitz","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635ceb348289a0007957aa6e","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1666618,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antti Hytti","original_name":"Antti Hytti","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635ceb41c9dbf9007d69e059","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3762705,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lauri Pitkänen","original_name":"Lauri Pitkänen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635ceb4aba4802007ed5c77d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3762705,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lauri Pitkänen","original_name":"Lauri Pitkänen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635ceb5bba480200975d49f9","department":"Art","job":"Storyboard Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1666618,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antti Hytti","original_name":"Antti Hytti","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635ceb669ba86a007d77cd28","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1666631,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Jyrälä","original_name":"Paul Jyrälä","popularity":0.0971,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635ceb7088c659008237c3d4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3762682,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Liisa Romu","original_name":"Liisa Romu","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635ceb87e263bb0090f46c09","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1674071,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tuomo Kattilakoski","original_name":"Tuomo Kattilakoski","popularity":0.1077,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64340314e92d830077f91447","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7758474","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1933,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8sNhUWyuTpHGElNumDhDprflvHX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1290}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":616,"name":"witch"},{"id":1421,"name":"birthday"},{"id":9921,"name":"easter"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
