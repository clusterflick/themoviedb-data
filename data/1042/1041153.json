The documentary follows Benedikt in his working and living environment, exploring the relationship between tools, the body, and the material world, in a sensual, haptic exchange, influenced by Hartmut Rosa’s concept of resonance: what might a resonant relationship to the world look like? The notion of listening gives an important clue: listening to the world as a whole, hearing voices other than human ones. Benedikt is a quiet, documentary portrait that gives the viewers time to reflect on themes such as life plan, loneliness, connections, and romance.","popularity":0.0962,"poster_path":"/3rBes8lkJfXcJSLB5Oudc9RAJ0E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Benedikt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3760862,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katrin Memmer","original_name":"Katrin Memmer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635b2358b3316b007cac0cac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1075,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3rBes8lkJfXcJSLB5Oudc9RAJ0E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"Internationales Frauen Film Fest Dortmund+Köln","release_date":"2022-04-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
