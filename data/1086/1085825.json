When a truckload of soldiers, having gang-raped a discarded naked woman, spots them in a house, the girls are forced up into the attic, but there appears to be no escape. Then the older girl tears their clothing, smears red muck over them, and orders the 4-year-old to lie still. This has the desired effect of convincing the men the girls had been raped and murdered, and they leave.","popularity":0.127,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Little Girls And A War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3917969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Borghildur Indriðadóttir","original_name":"Borghildur Indriðadóttir","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"63e93dd1bf09d1007f8e1ad3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3917970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liina Magnea Matila","original_name":"Liina Magnea Matila","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"63e93dd7a2e60200932a68cf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3917971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-Luise Gutteck","original_name":"Marie-Luise Gutteck","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"63e93ddebf09d1007f8e1ae2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3917972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johannes Hupka","original_name":"Johannes Hupka","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"63e93de5bf09d10079139569","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238472,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ilkka Matila","original_name":"Ilkka Matila","popularity":0.1003,"profile_path":"/oFsHMLQLno4xQQWt0vJbzq6e89h.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"63e93dec12777847de81c37d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1416099,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Solrun","original_name":"Maria Solrun","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e93dfbbf09d1008f43a6f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1416099,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Solrun","original_name":"Maria Solrun","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e93e0463aad2007a64c489","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3917973,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michael Doering","original_name":"Michael Doering","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e93e0f9512e10084627ee1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":50643,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Christine Boock","original_name":"Christine Boock","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e93e196c849200851b4f93","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3917974,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Guðni Franzson","original_name":"Guðni Franzson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e93e2412777800ab952422","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238472,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ilkka Matila","original_name":"Ilkka Matila","popularity":0.1003,"profile_path":"/oFsHMLQLno4xQQWt0vJbzq6e89h.jpg","credit_id":"63e93e346c8492007d2697ed","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0122295","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"is","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
