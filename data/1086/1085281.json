She later discovers that the old lady is dying and a personal awareness of having done an unloving act weighs heavily upon her. Her motherâ€™s loving response to her torment and instinctive gestures of consolation even as she lets Missy know the seriousness of her action, frees Missy and she finds her own special way to express her sorrow. The dramatic tension traces the dynamics of the sacrament of Penance, as Missy experiences sorrow, guilt and the peace that comes with forgiveness.","popularity":0.1612,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Names of Sin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1412669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nancy Ann Nelson","original_name":"Nancy Ann Nelson","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/yTOcLOmQSoxBPXj8vvHwhRkCoKt.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Mother","credit_id":"63e7cb5bd388ae00d2b24630","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":151848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte Knight","original_name":"Charlotte Knight","popularity":0.1928,"profile_path":"/53c2IzFwecqIVYM7tCYB9L8miD0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The old lady","credit_id":"63e7cb74a2e6020081fa96f4","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1131146,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rolf Forsberg","original_name":"Rolf Forsberg","popularity":0.0665,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e7cb21d388ae00b639775e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1131146,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rolf Forsberg","original_name":"Rolf Forsberg","popularity":0.0665,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e7cb1a12777800ab945ff4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9965,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Allen Daviau","original_name":"Allen Daviau","popularity":0.1238,"profile_path":"/iz7TiZQ2YaPn47j7Gj8mMDGUT3W.jpg","credit_id":"63e7cb4bd388ae0086982a45","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0330677","wikidata_id":"Q123288280","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
