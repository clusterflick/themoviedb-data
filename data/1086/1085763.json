From opening a shiny new bike on Christmas morning to the grind of a daily commute, bicycles hold a multitude of meanings and opportunities for women across the world. Using archival footage from across the UK’s film archives, The Freedom Machine shows the ways women have used the bicycle to find freedom and independence on the road, the race track and beyond.  With a soundtrack by sound artist Cat Hawthorn, the film by emerging curator Jo Reid uses archival footage to entwine her personal experiences as a cyclist with the wider struggles and joys women across the world have discovered from travelling on two wheels.","popularity":0.1089,"poster_path":"/lqAQ1FvOTbAokd1H04VoQPeLzIX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Freedom Machine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3801965,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jo Reid","original_name":"Jo Reid","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e9216d12777800895fc069","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lqAQ1FvOTbAokd1H04VoQPeLzIX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1414}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":154866,"name":"archive footage"},{"id":180491,"name":"cycling"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Glasgow Film Festival","release_date":"2023-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
