A young man sits on a bench by the Reykjavik Lake, keeping a promise to his childhood love, a promise made fifteen years earlier. As the day grows old he still waits the long wait, in small hope of being reunited with his lost love. A young woman bearing remarkable resemblance to his young love seduces him to abandon the long wait, and his principles. By doing so, the young man pays the ultimate price.","popularity":0.1218,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":193195,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ivan Hoe Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"2001-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Dark Spring","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Björn Hlynur Haraldsson","original_name":"Björn Hlynur Haraldsson","popularity":0.3258,"profile_path":"/o3Th2T9TewVBg87jFqtnyHBKSd6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"63e84fd012777800ab94b39f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1113794,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brynja Valdís Gísladóttir","original_name":"Brynja Valdís Gísladóttir","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/9f6gFa80zjYaeUAH16AIfW2YP12.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"63e84fd863aad200858797d3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":545132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Víkingur Kristjánsson","original_name":"Víkingur Kristjánsson","popularity":0.1101,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"63e84fdf1277780081a3b73d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Björgvin Franz Gíslason","original_name":"Björgvin Franz Gíslason","popularity":0.1188,"profile_path":"/8qummhhFgqtY9BnH1F9JSx1thnU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"63e84fe59512e100a97d8019","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3916761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hafsteinn Tómas Sverrisson","original_name":"Hafsteinn Tómas Sverrisson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"63e84fef63aad200e05d1ff3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3916762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dagný Hrönn Ásgeirsdóttir","original_name":"Dagný Hrönn Ásgeirsdóttir","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"63e84ff9a2e60200b5ee0715","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3916766,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Guðjón Þór Erlendsson","original_name":"Guðjón Þór Erlendsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e8504412777800ab94b3ec","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3914713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hinrik Hoe Haraldsson","original_name":"Hinrik Hoe Haraldsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e8500aa2e60200b5ee0728","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3916763,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ivan Nio","original_name":"Ivan Nio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e850259512e100cd71f445","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3914713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hinrik Hoe Haraldsson","original_name":"Hinrik Hoe Haraldsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e8502c9512e1008462022e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3916765,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hermann Valur Hoe Haraldsson","original_name":"Hermann Valur Hoe Haraldsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e85039a2e602007bb7644d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3050580,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ísak Jónsson","original_name":"Ísak Jónsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e8501c6c849200cfb233e7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":59991,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Herbert Sveinbjörnsson","original_name":"Herbert Sveinbjörnsson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e85014a2e6020081faf13a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3914713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hinrik Hoe Haraldsson","original_name":"Hinrik Hoe Haraldsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e850056c849200c772c863","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"is","note":"","release_date":"2001-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
