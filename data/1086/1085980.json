The title is in Latin and means names are not necessary even pointless. Maybe that was a statement from the director for future films to come. Scenes from a school graduation party mix with shots of soft-drink bottles a conveyor belt. Both the bottles and the students are alike, universal, unoriginal and, above all, nameless. The film was screened at a school anniversary in March 1975 and broadcast on the only television station a few months later.","popularity":0.0948,"poster_path":"/xaRFCxw7yvZHpLHFof26Oe8HrKj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":193286,"logo_path":null,"name":"Menntaskólinn við Tjörnina","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"1975-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nomina Sunt Odiosa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3918370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Einar Einarsson","original_name":"Einar Einarsson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"63e9854ed388ae0094c4ff99","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6759,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fridrik Thor Fridriksson","original_name":"Fridrik Thor Fridriksson","popularity":0.1263,"profile_path":"/iBTUqqjVDSio6ROLBPfkucOpEkD.jpg","credit_id":"63e9855dd388ae0080625e73","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6759,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fridrik Thor Fridriksson","original_name":"Fridrik Thor Fridriksson","popularity":0.1263,"profile_path":"/iBTUqqjVDSio6ROLBPfkucOpEkD.jpg","credit_id":"63e985589512e100a97e0a4e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6759,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fridrik Thor Fridriksson","original_name":"Fridrik Thor Fridriksson","popularity":0.1263,"profile_path":"/iBTUqqjVDSio6ROLBPfkucOpEkD.jpg","credit_id":"63e9856e6c849200c7735ca6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1945471,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Þorsteinn Úlfar Björnsson","original_name":"Þorsteinn Úlfar Björnsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e98568d388ae00b63a56eb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1019942","wikidata_id":"Q7048560","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xaRFCxw7yvZHpLHFof26Oe8HrKj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"is","note":"","release_date":"1975-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
