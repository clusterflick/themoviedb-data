The narrative thread is built from the experiences of the first indigenous workers: medical personnel, specialists in engineering or agronomy and indigenous promoters. The film accounts for two key moments of the time: the foundation and start of operations of the first Indigenous Coordination Center created by the National Indigenous Institute (INI), in San Cristobal de Las Casas, Chiapas, and the relocation process of the chinanteca and mazateca communities affected by the construction of the Miguel Aleman dam.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/6kQSKeNtWVrekjbg8jVsaXZOVKA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":158491,"logo_path":null,"name":"Instituto Nacional Indigenista","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"1956-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Testimony of the Mexican integrationist policy of the 1950s with the first actions towards the indigenous population by the newly created National Indigenous Institute.","title":"Nuevos horizontes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1130047,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Silvestre Revueltas","original_name":"Silvestre Revueltas","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e840ff12777800ab94a8bb","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3916666,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José Arenas","original_name":"José Arenas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e83eb763aad200e05d123d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3916673,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nacho López","original_name":"Nacho López","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e840e4a2e60200d4aed146","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3916676,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sergio Martínez Austria","original_name":"Sergio Martínez Austria","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e8412fa2e602009329f129","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/6kQSKeNtWVrekjbg8jVsaXZOVKA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":853}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"1956-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
