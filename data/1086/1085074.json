It is a story of rave, resistance, and resilience that champions the scene's pioneers with interviews from Jumpinâ€™ Jack Frost, Ray Keith, Dillinja, Ragga Twins, Micky Finn, Paul Ibiza, and G.Q. and many more of its revolutionary mavericks. An exhilarating and intimate look into the creation of this beloved multicultural underground art form and its continued legacy today.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/t3XfMnMb3mnpDLeE5RC5VEn7AS7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rest Is History: The Early Days of Drum & Bass","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t3XfMnMb3mnpDLeE5RC5VEn7AS7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
