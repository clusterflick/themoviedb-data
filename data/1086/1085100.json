It is a \"propaganda battle\" internally and externally. Russia spreads targeted disinformation in order to systematically devalue news. At the same time, their own population should be convinced that they want to liberate Ukraine from Nazis. Ukraine's narrative wants to emotionally mobilize its own population and strengthen resistance to the aggressor. Spindoctors are of particular importance in the propaganda battle over Ukraine. On the Ukrainian side, it's often influencers like Oleksiy Arestovych. On the Russian side, Vladimir Solovyov, Putin's snout, is supposed to sell the war to his own people with his daily TV talks. The documentary shows the new front lines of virtual warfare and provides insights into the populists' bag of tricks on social networks.","popularity":0.199,"poster_path":"/ir3srDQJGO31sbn6vRWtMOHaLbb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106922,"logo_path":"/ve3Btm9GUqlPNvboCHQgPZveFBp.png","name":"Berlin
