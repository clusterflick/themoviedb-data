Piu Piu, as the actor, set designer and costume designer Elpídio Lima was known, is considered the oldest transformist in Recife. In the 1950s and 1960s, he performed at the Barreto Junior Company, on the stages of the Almare and Morroco theaters. He was one of the creators of the Companhia Tra-la-lá, a swish theater and liked to imitate the singers and actresses Sarita Montiel and Carmem Miranda.","popularity":0.0658,"poster_path":"/b2CpN721xpCwFhsqrfyWQ7XyFSF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Piu Piu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2184165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandre Figueirôa","original_name":"Alexandre Figueirôa","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/qIb9s4OiMca1oW2HXXriiH31ouh.jpg","credit_id":"611cd08885c0a2005ddbeea2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1394365,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chico Lacerda","original_name":"Chico Lacerda","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/qrFWPUS1xtX47DVnfcy3rDMjCzm.jpg","credit_id":"66630c5b32248508d008a1c5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2184165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandre Figueirôa","original_name":"Alexandre Figueirôa","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/qIb9s4OiMca1oW2HXXriiH31ouh.jpg","credit_id":"66630c6d17cc9c6d283ca84f","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2184165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandre Figueirôa","original_name":"Alexandre Figueirôa","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/qIb9s4OiMca1oW2HXXriiH31ouh.jpg","credit_id":"66630c6495c4813b6214fcb9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4761021,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Túlio Vasconcelos","original_name":"Túlio Vasconcelos","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66630c525181160b2e09d282","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b2CpN721xpCwFhsqrfyWQ7XyFSF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
