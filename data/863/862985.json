However, only 10 Chongryon Korean high schools are excluded from this policy. The reason is that there are suspicions that the grant for free education will be misused by Chochongryon and others. Five of these schools protested about this measure and filed a claim for damages against the government in 2013. After four years of hearings, the first trial decision was made on July 19, 2017, starting with the case of Hiroshima Chongryon Korean high school.","popularity":0.3152,"poster_path":"/7w96JIAXCUSTBNgZhwR4WZUI7JQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2023-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Discrimination","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"Chabyeol","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2009997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shinzo Abe","original_name":"Shinzo Abe","popularity":0.2511,"profile_path":"/zcYcULiTCNiA3juxwb08ALrpyOr.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"641ef972253fab00d432f275","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3677652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bae Jin-man","original_name":"Bae Jin-man","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Self - Narrator","credit_id":"657884bebbe1dd0138d08ad3","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3203330,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lee Sa-young","original_name":"Lee Sa-young","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611d8aa46c19ea007fb82144","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3203327,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Ji-woon","original_name":"Kim Ji-woon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611d8a62151c5c00461a9c64","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3203331,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lee Youngchul","original_name":"Lee Youngchul","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611d8aaeac4161005cdc2f01","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3203327,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Ji-woon","original_name":"Kim Ji-woon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611d8a8a5437f50074c402a2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3203328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Do-hee","original_name":"Kim Do-hee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611d8a96d1a893005c292090","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3203328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Do-hee","original_name":"Kim Do-hee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61466e8c5e120000423788e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4426260,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lim Kyung-rok","original_name":"Lim Kyung-rok","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657884074bfa545d010a4468","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3203327,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Ji-woon","original_name":"Kim Ji-woon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657883c22dc9dc00ad1876d5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3203327,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Ji-woon","original_name":"Kim Ji-woon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657883d0f04d0100c691e5f9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3203328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Do-hee","original_name":"Kim Do-hee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657883ac7a3c52012d0108e7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3203328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Do-hee","original_name":"Kim Do-hee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657883b789d97f00e3759483","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15300252","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1429,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/7w96JIAXCUSTBNgZhwR4WZUI7JQ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1429,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/p1nejrZSXdBaIxRu0XXyHHwLd7H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":270709,"name":"zainichi"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"DMZ Docs","release_date":"2021-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"All","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
