When Amara hears about the school’s annual potluck, she takes it as an opportunity to finally join Sama’s world outside of their home. The duo connect while preparing some party potatoes but when Amara suggests to bring a traditional Indian dish, any chance of connection is severed and on top of that the dish for the potluck is burned. After speaking to her daughter, Amara realizes that their troubles aren’t so different and that as a mother it’s her duty to help Sama fit into this world which Amara does not quite understand, thus remaking the American potatoes but adding a slight Indian twist.","popularity":0.0564,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aloo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3200539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Priya Kiran","original_name":"Priya Kiran","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611b088a66540800473fbf29","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12738698","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
