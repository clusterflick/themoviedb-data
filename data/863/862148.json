A poetic narration accompanied by meditative sounds gradually sinks the images into the viewer. An intriguing subjective montage of dream sequences and sounds, fragments of cultural contexts, bound together by the characters inner monologue. A series of circular, rhyming narrative repetitions, laying out desire and anxiety, with the chance that a particular dream might transcend away from the disappointment of reality into a sought of spiritual transcendence. The geography of the unconscious world and cinematic desires juxtapose over the topography of separating lovers as an aching journey: we must betray the memories of the ones we loved to love again. This film strives to follow a narrative trajectory, but itself becomes a poetic elegy.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elegy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3200529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Parish Sharma","original_name":"Parish Sharma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611b06442dc44e005c615c26","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14625350","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
