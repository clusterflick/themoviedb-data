During this night at the museum, she wanders from room to room and films the enigmatic creatures she encounters - animals, works, but also the artists and accomplices she has invited. These successive apparitions compose the scenes of a surrealist film that spectators can discover in a giant projection on the façade of the museum during an exceptional evening.","popularity":0.0708,"poster_path":"/5rTHd2dOnuz6s5z0uskWx8eranN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159183,"logo_path":null,"name":"Musée de la Chasse et de la Nature","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taxidermize Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"François Chaignaud","original_name":"François Chaignaud","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"627f5b666d000c0067ecf353","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2681557,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Simon Fravega","original_name":"Simon Fravega","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"627f5b716d1bb237da965c09","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2040645,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Théophile Gay-Mazas","original_name":"Théophile Gay-Mazas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"627f5b786d1bb237dbcbd2b3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3548864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florencia Grisanti","original_name":"Florencia Grisanti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"627f5b806d1bb237dc5f7d6d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3510776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Gresard","original_name":"Victor Gresard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"627f5b86006eee524f3b393e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3548865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manon Haize","original_name":"Manon Haize","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"627f5b8c20e6a555ac43c9a5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3548866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"François Leloup-Collet","original_name":"François Leloup-Collet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"627f5ba06d1bb237dc5f7d80","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3502376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Pierre Petit","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Petit","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"627f5baa2dc9dc0066cab390","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1038015,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie Losier","original_name":"Marie Losier","popularity":0.2863,"profile_path":"/4dwd7fUTjHyPZJ9eDZmxVfrdUlI.jpg","credit_id":"611ac38e0f0da5005f548b62","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15106600","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5rTHd2dOnuz6s5z0uskWx8eranN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v91PjvmPBBzL1Q7XtPUVm9LpMsQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"FIDMarseille","release_date":"2021-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sicilia Queer","release_date":"2021-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
