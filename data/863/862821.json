In their Nobel prize speeches, directed at the Western audience, they meditate on the Japanese identity and how it correlates with their oeuvre. Tomotosi plays up this classic heritage. The artist delicately intervenes in city rituals via six performances and records his fellow citizens' reactions. In this way, he dissects daily life and the unwritten rules of social interaction in Japan.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Japan, the Beautiful or Ambiguous, and Ourselves","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"일본, 아름다운 혹은 모호한, 그리고 우리 자신","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3202798,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomotosi","original_name":"Tomotosi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611d16ff514c4a00299f054a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"EXiS 2021","release_date":"2021-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
