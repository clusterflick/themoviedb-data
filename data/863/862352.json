These are nine issues of Cine Escuela Argentino, a project created in 1948 by the Argentine Ministry of Education during the first government of Juan Domingo Perón. The latter promoted “the use of the cinematographer as a didactic assistant destined to complete the educational and cultural work, mainly in what concerns exalting the feelings of the nationality, with the heroic example of the heroes, Christian morality and the multiple civil duties, great and small”. Hence, most of the films produced by Cine Escuela Argentino were aimed at scientific dissemination and tourism promotion of the various regions of the country.
