At Ivan’s door the bell is rung by a scared stranger who asks “to sit it out for a while”, explaining that she went by a rally and “accidentally” got her share. Vanya lets her in. But at the door an OMON officer turns up, who is looking for the most active protesters. Vanya opens: he has nothing to hide, especially since he hates these “morons shouting outside his window”. To get away, the beauty plays a whole performance before the OMON, involving Vanya; it becomes clear that she is not what she pretended to be.","popularity":0.0894,"poster_path":"/bpVuPaRkXyM0TmSHwoPFF5310Gm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118032,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Studio Heirs","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2021-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On Different Sides","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1247543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Fominov","original_name":"Иван Фоминов","popularity":0.2979,"profile_path":"/sCQsVgufjpLKvFOlukczYmVMuWO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"61478394daf57c0043688491","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1724254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ekaterina Kabak","original_name":"Екатерина Кабак","popularity":0.1564,"profile_path":"/hL0YDBYffnvo8Zc2uNkdWIrAC3m.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6147839b5e12000020b819cb","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2305552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darya Lebedeva","original_name":"Darya Lebedeva","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/iXGhPTqtzNMhPi7WilVqt7aZOeB.jpg","credit_id":"611ba3f9d1a8930045cbeffb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3240166,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrey Gubenko","original_name":"Andrey Gubenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614783b6e55937006178ec32","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3240168,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrey Shabaev-Markin","original_name":"Andrey Shabaev-Markin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614783db688cd000428fcf9a","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2305555,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anton Tyurikov","original_name":"Anton Tyurikov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6147840ea6ddcb0043af4e6a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3240167,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Alsu Sharipova","original_name":"Alsu Sharipova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614783cb9f0e1900647ed5c4","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3240169,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Denis Ryabukhov","original_name":"Denis Ryabukhov","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614783f3c2823a006439d2df","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2305552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darya Lebedeva","original_name":"Darya Lebedeva","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/iXGhPTqtzNMhPi7WilVqt7aZOeB.jpg","credit_id":"614783a85e12000063cf55dc","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/bpVuPaRkXyM0TmSHwoPFF5310Gm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Open Russian Film Festival Kinotavr","release_date":"2021-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
