They decide to move, to keep house for themselves, and a week later we find them in a cozy flat in the suburbs. Mrs. Hunter has an irresistible desire to purchase everything for the apartment at a \"bargain,\" and many humorous incidents occur on this account. The climax comes when she finally purchases an oil stove, which not only smokes up the whole apartment, but finally explodes. They decide that although boarding costs more, it is cheaper in the end, especially when the home is run by an inexperienced housekeeper.","popularity":0.0577,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bargain Hunters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wallace Beery","original_name":"Wallace Beery","popularity":0.2342,"profile_path":"/v8cHzbuHEqNUYmO7Oj66Im424uR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mr. Hunter","credit_id":"61bf2fe0fcadb400609ff945","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2025537,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Hennessy","original_name":"Ruth Hennessy","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mrs. Hunter","credit_id":"61bf2fef2973380042f4f77b","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0218830","wikidata_id":"Q13564903","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
