Edited at The London collage of printing and St Martins school of art. Shot on 8mm and vhs and u matic tape and found footage. The colourisation was created using a wonderful hand made early colour synth that was installed into the edit suite at the L.C.P at the time. I started doing live projectons for 23 skidoos performances having already known Johnny and Alex Turnbul from being in the same skateboard team and hanging out at skate cty skateboard park with them. They released 7 songs and wanted to make pictures to go with the tracks. We were rehearsing In Throbbing Gristles recording studio in london fields in Hackney at the time and i filmed them there for the small bit of live footage of them in the video. I released the VHS of this with Doublevsion a coumpany from Shefield .
