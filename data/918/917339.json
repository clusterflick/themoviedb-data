Follow along as the company embarks on its remarkable creative journey and take a deep dive into the psyches of the company’s founders (Donovan Zimmerman and Jan Burger), and the diverse group of artists who help bring the show to life.  Shot primarily on a single camera and with no budget in Saxapahaw and Chapel Hill, NC, We Are Here is a 55-minute documentary that investigates the intention and process of a community whose aim is to move us to action through moving art.  It takes a whole lot more than cardboard, wood, duct tape, and string to make a great show. In We Are Here, we find out what makes a puppet come to life and we are challenged to reconsider our own place in the world.","popularity":0.0794,"poster_path":"/iGxdbdLzG0hhzX5UrheJNY7NPUG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A documentary film about artists trying to save the world.","title":"We Are Here","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3350942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donovan Zimmerman","original_name":"Donovan Zimmerman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"61bd5b6085b1050092f3a4d0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3350943,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan Burger","original_name":"Jan Burger","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"61bd5b71873f00008d4b3786","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3350941,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc Levy","original_name":"Marc Levy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61bd5aedf288380062a4fab9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1594,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2Ev8ZVkRWBM7GuBgYZniP6ULOsr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2833}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1700,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iGxdbdLzG0hhzX5UrheJNY7NPUG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1133}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":289246,"name":"paperhand puppet"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"We Are Here: A Documentary about Paperhand Puppet Intervention - Teaser Trailer","key":"581251960","site":"Vimeo","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-07-30T16:28:37.000Z","id":"61bd5c27d2f5b500611cbf09"}]}}}
