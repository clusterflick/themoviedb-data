The soldier in a moment of anger attacks the sergeant who for this gesture makes him imprison. The war council's judgment is immediate: deportation to military prison. In the military prison we see shocked and threatened men who are punished with torture and other brutal rites if they do not follow orders. The soldier, after a plot that took place inside the prison, is thrown into a silo that if it had not been for the help of a friend he would have died. The two men try to escape but both die.","popularity":0.1123,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1907-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Military Prison","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090767,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucien Nonguet","original_name":"Lucien Nonguet","popularity":0.0677,"profile_path":"/avsz3vRmL5yYlYcTPaaCP9v2ewa.jpg","credit_id":"61bc4f8154a0980042ea3363","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0339946","wikidata_id":"Q43228232","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1907-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1907-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"À Biribi, disciplinaires français (1907) A Military Prison (Pathé)","key":"EiHdHOquiVk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-03-30T20:39:38.000Z","id":"674328f368823004ca9c9945"}]}}}
