As a special treat, her older sister Gvantsa joins her for four-handed works by Dvořák, Brahms, and Piazzolla.  Described as a “force of nature”, Georgian pianist Khatia Buniatishvili takes her art into the wilderness with this concert. On a wooden stage, she sits in an earthy concert hall performing works of particular meaning for her, and beloved by audiences the world over. From Debussy’s Clair de Lune to Ravel’s La Valse, from Stravinsky’s Petrushka to Piazzolla’s Improvisations on Libertango, Buniatishvili demonstrates her wide palette of expression and lyric approach to her instrument. Interspersed with the music are intimate interviews of the artist herself in which she discusses on her musical upbringing, her career, and her impressions of the pieces she has chosen to include in the program.","popularity":0.2907,"poster_path":"/5XOXtNQrgYqhudzBAHuHDAPoJqG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79564,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sony
