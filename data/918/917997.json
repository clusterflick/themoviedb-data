With the driver as narrator, this poetic, and sometimes fantastical (the train talks at one point) celebration of steam transportation evokes a bygone era when the train “would stop at every crossing, hedge and house.” The steam train is cast as an integral part of a vast landscape and the communities that it travels through.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1mAaXkQIYDdq8WdEkrqYojIhOGb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Train for Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1mAaXkQIYDdq8WdEkrqYojIhOGb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
