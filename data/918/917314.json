Peter Wright’s production, a classic itself, perfectly achieves the dual aspects of the ballet, moving from the naivety of young love between Giselle and Albrecht in the village setting of Act I to the ethereal Wilis in Act II’s eerie moonlit forest. Rich in vivid character detail and poignant depth of feeling, Giselle is a reminder of ballet’s power to move and thrill.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/io7pM5dRWQLyQkeY3lNIp6z8McY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Giselle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1897675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yasmine Naghdi","original_name":"Yasmine Naghdi","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/u52cswFHnSIc5x9IFgUrvJmHdnm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Giselle","credit_id":"61bd4026223e2000634b7ae7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1897743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Ball","original_name":"Matthew Ball","popularity":0.2883,"profile_path":"/k2uWLdUrMzAylzoT8XffJnnLjNN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Albretch","credit_id":"61bd403bd2f5b50041b61776","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1897674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luca Acri","original_name":"Luca Acri","popularity":0.0782,"profile_path":"/dAvr5usOcPWhpUZPcf9A86CEukb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Hilarion","credit_id":"61bd404e498ef90065f45aca","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1559909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marianela Núñez","original_name":"Marianela Núñez","popularity":0.1053,"profile_path":"/2SNAws34XSgVkrcoqgSJDFl6QTl.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Myrtha","credit_id":"61bd405fd2f5b500611c7614","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1067,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/io7pM5dRWQLyQkeY3lNIp6z8McY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":758}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
