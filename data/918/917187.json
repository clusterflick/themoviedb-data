Her father Fu, from the tiny Pacific island of Rotuma — population 2000 — had long given up explaining where it was (even to his Dutch wife Marion). In this Tagata Pasifika documentary, Ngaire’s beloved father takes ill, so she visits his birthplace with her eight-year-old daughter Ruby. One flight to Nadi, a drive to Suva and a three-day boat ride later, they reach the island during the magical Fara season.","popularity":0.0673,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":295,"logo_path":"/24lAsHZaGi4GzNrWzlkK60HLMBx.png","name":"NZ on Air","origin_country":"NZ"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Salat es Rotuma - Passage to Rotuma","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3350440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ngaire Fuata","original_name":"Ngaire Fuata","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"61bcc33b6905fb0042f07475","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1359982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikki Si'ulepa","original_name":"Nikki Si'ulepa","popularity":0.1123,"profile_path":"/pXx64WyyNSRA0uiWG7LL8MFGgG7.jpg","credit_id":"61bcc30201432500432fb1b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3350439,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"debbie matthews","original_name":"debbie matthews","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61bcc31b873f000042bb1f18","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
