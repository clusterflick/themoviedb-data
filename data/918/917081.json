All of the color in the piece is orchestrated in brightness ‘octaves’ corresponding to the registration of the pitches in the soundtrack. Each hue from a circle of twelve corresponds to one of the pitches of a tempered scale. The articulation of the piece consists of a series of loudness and brightness ripples which move across the piece in speed relationships derived from the hue and pitch proportions. The image content, or the ‘instruments’ through which the colors resonate, are an alphabetical set of identifying symbols for 32 of the largest corporations in the world.\" - Bob Snyder","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/tSrWIh7oo3JZIekrDkaE30yLCdm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spectral Brands","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1311368,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bob Snyder","original_name":"Bob Snyder","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61bc5fee6905fb008610f881","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tSrWIh7oo3JZIekrDkaE30yLCdm.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
