Frank shot footage of the Bickershaw festival in 1972. This footage serves as the visual foundations for the film, An event in the village. We see Frankâ€™s original footage as we hear him describing the recording of the event 35 years after it happened. The Bickershaw festival was the last 3 day festival in the north west of England. The Kinks, Captain Beefheart and the Grateful Dead all played during the weekend. This work investigates memory and documentary - the gaps between event, actuality, recording and memory. Frank speaks with great fondness about his village and its takeover by Hippies over a long weekend in May 1972.","popularity":0.0744,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An event in the village","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1291586,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jordan Baseman","original_name":"Jordan Baseman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61bdaa7b6a300b0064989563","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
