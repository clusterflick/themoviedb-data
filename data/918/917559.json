Through interviews with West End performers and creatives, this documentary outlines the difficulties presented to our industry over the course of the pandemic, as well as highlighting changes - both positive and negative - that have come from it.  An emotional reflection on a battle it was worth fighting for. All profits will be going to 'Acting for Others', an organisation that provides support to all theatre workers through 14 member charities. We hope these stories full of passion for Theatre inspire you just as much as they inspired us!","popularity":2.059,"poster_path":"/yt8yRZO0mjexQoDLj1UeYNuJTiF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United
