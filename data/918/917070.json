So far I have made many so-called commissioned industrial films for national oil, gas, and steel companies as well as for government ministries, in which I tried to bring the films as close as possible to my taste and to my way of thinking and make the films' sponsors to see the world from content and formal viewpoints. Some of these films encountered serious censorship problems and part of them were cut for their public screenings, such as Gas, Fire, Wind and The Genaveh Project, both of which were filmed during the Iran-Iraq war.\"  - Kamran Shirdel","popularity":0.8398,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Shoga (Glass and Gas) Company","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1124028,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kamran Shirdel","original_name":"Kamran Shirdel","popularity":0.0464,"profile_path":"/akyzIhdP0HaZfbHzweOW4EPh57c.jpg","credit_id":"61bc5a09a44d090064aeea8f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13578046","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
