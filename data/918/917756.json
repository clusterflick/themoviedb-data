It is a must for fans and serious students alike.","popularity":0.3875,"poster_path":"/rMfSVS3k6Op7j4QED7kvWoUqm37.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":166545,"logo_path":null,"name":"International Sport and Leisure (ISL)","origin_country":""},{"id":166546,"logo_path":null,"name":"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung","origin_country":""},{"id":74310,"logo_path":null,"name":"Worldmark","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The official film of the 1988 UEFA European Football Championship.","title":"Tor!
