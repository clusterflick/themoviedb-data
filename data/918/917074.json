From there they go to a restaurant and seat themselves for a meal. The waiter, in serving the soup, stumbles, with the result that he spills the contents of the tureen on the lady's new hat. She is mortified and enraged, and her husband immediately halls a cab and takes her home, where on reaching her room she throws the hat to the ground and falls to weeping. A servant enters, and seeing the mined headgear on the ground, adopts it as her own. She fixes it up to suit her taste and is next seen wearing it as she meets her lover, the policeman. Together they go to a park and seat themselves on a bench, the servant placing her hat beside her. While the couple are busy, a very stout gentleman comes along, seats himself on the hat and proceeds to read his newspaper.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1907-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grandeur et décadence d'un chapeau","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Ups and Downs of a Hat","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1745712","wikidata_id":"Q18230723","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1907-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Grandeur et décadence d’un chapeau (1907) Ups and Downs of a Hat (Pathé)","key":"D8bfLZcrxtE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-04-04T20:42:37.000Z","id":"66b95a3f79bec1c3791a33c3"}]}}}
