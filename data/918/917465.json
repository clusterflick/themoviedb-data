Kicking off with a note of gratitude from Young (“I’m so glad we’re fuckin’ here!”), the trailer shows what things were like as the legendary band got back into their element, in the wild, making music in a restored, 19th-century log barn under a full, glowing moon. The film captures the group—a 50-year-old musical family that includes, Billy Talbot, Ralph Molina and Nils Lofgren —building the powerful new record, but also their easy humour and enduring brotherhood. - The Sound Cafe (www.thesoundcafe.com)","popularity":0.8356,"poster_path":"/aqAY4unPSP2v6f7sVk6Zybc60bS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11378,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shakey Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Band - A Brotherhood - A Barn","title":"Barn","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"A Band A Brotherhood A Barn","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Young","original_name":"Neil Young","popularity":0.4751,"profile_path":"/pAEPuSZTK29JAzRkz5W1Vb1dTAe.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"61bdf93d85b105004202f9ab","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nils Lofgren","original_name":"Nils Lofgren","popularity":0.3016,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"61bdf94a6905fb0042f283c7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":235287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Talbot","original_name":"Billy Talbot","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":"/zkxNoAZICtbsk7ru8yMOsQfxRB7.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"61bdf99cfa404600422f758e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":235288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Molina","original_name":"Ralph Molina","popularity":0.0564,"profile_path":"/wEokrWVjxLpjcUH7uTdUXnxu7Ix.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"61ee73a7cd2046001b680b03","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daryl Hannah","original_name":"Daryl Hannah","popularity":3.6582,"profile_path":"/4LLmp6AQdlj6ueGCRbVRSGvvFSt.jpg","credit_id":"61ee73c3d40d4c0043a4dd33","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3351369,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gary Ward","original_name":"Gary Ward","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679160c5a3c7d79472e0122f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3351375,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jason Dopko","original_name":"Jason Dopko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67916145ff3ad134e0774236","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3174499,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Steve Forner","original_name":"Steve Forner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67916157550e6fc3cde01d50","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3351376,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rachel Simmer","original_name":"Rachel Simmer","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67916161de44a2098677656a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Young","original_name":"Neil Young","popularity":0.4751,"profile_path":"/pAEPuSZTK29JAzRkz5W1Vb1dTAe.jpg","credit_id":"67b2b499a65d6303e7e0d2a8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5251603,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Niko Bolas","original_name":"Niko Bolas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b2b4b385f576e97d6dd557","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3351374,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Adam C.K.
