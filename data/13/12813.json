Amidst a crumbling former East Berlin (its bulidings, cars, people & culture), Sam develops a \"family\" for the new millenium, for the new generation of post-drug cocktail AIDS victims. The fragile \"family\" he forms includes his on-again-off-again boyfriend Rainer, and his best friend Bastl with his latest fling, Mike. Like the old, schmaltzy East German songs which Sam is recording, the sweet innocence of the characters struggle to prevail, the misfortunes of the characters nothwithstanding.","popularity":0.2823,"poster_path":"/gyGfaCqi8S8481lJSsQYqGM9QqA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2001-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Return
