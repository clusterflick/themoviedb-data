The trouble is that she leaves Sonia, her true love, behind. The latter, a teacher who loves her job, refuses to give up everything - including her comfort - to follow her. Sonia makes all the efforts in the world to forget Cheyenne, whether in the arms of Pierre, a charming anarchist, or in those of Béatrice, a gay woman who soon proves perverse and dangerous, only to realize that her heart belongs to Cheyenne and nobody else.","popularity":0.4557,"poster_path":"/aFQkLzjTtVqpi1EYoDbweD31MN7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2711,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bandonéon","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2005-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Looking
