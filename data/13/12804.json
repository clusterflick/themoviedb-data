The audience sees how the relationships between the photographer and the subjects changes during their time together, as well as how the individual photographs begin to take shape.  Pedro Usabiaga is a well-established Basque photographer whose chief concerns are figurative photography and whose passion in photographing the Spanish male. In this hour long conversation with the artist we are given entry into that process of selecting models (none of the models he uses for this book to be titled 'Private Diary' are professional, but instead are randomly chosen as Usabiaga observes athletes in action) and then allowed to follow Usabiaga and his crew as they photograph these men in natural settings and natural light.","popularity":0.4382,"poster_path":"/3XWmAI5ApAkJXBk26HDv1Fg1HHN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2003-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Private Diary","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Private Diary","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Diario Intimo","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Diario Intimo de Pedro Usabiaga","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Diario Íntimo","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":73674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pedro Usabiaga","original_name":"Pedro Usabiaga","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe45259251416c7504d337","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0377076","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/to9tRFK9k2GKu8pdeYSztM5Q4tL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/pSX7z0RQ6wwPwZJ73qqvNjLIOe1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3XWmAI5ApAkJXBk26HDv1Fg1HHN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":526}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":966,"name":"beach"},{"id":9624,"name":"donostia-san sebastian, spain"},{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
