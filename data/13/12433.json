Malek (Abdelkader Affak) is a surveyor from Algeria who is semi-retired, but at the urging of a friend he takes an assignment in Oran. The region in question was the site of frequent battles during Oran's civil war, and an earlier survey that would make it possible to bring electrical utilities to the area was cut short by the fighting. While the zone is still unstable, Malek sets out to complete charting the area, and finds the locals regard him with suspicion and hostility. However, not everyone is disrespectful, and he discovers a young woman (Ines Rose Djakou) who is attracted to him, which leads him to consider abandoning his old life to run away with her. Inland was an official selection at the 2008 Venice Film Festival.","popularity":0.1953,"poster_path":"/8RN5zkUFmxQcn8GSsb35FHjdPQk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2008-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inland","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1063081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kader Affak","original_name":"Kader Affak","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/iebuA8zNdgFPqgvHSgPVo9BPTFm.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Malek","credit_id":"5308ef7492514111050024cf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1295577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ina Rose Djakou","original_name":"Ina Rose Djakou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The girl","credit_id":"5308ef81925141110e002464","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1295579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fethi Ghares","original_name":"Fethi Ghares","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"The activist","credit_id":"5308ef9d925141111100239b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1295580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kouider Medjahed","original_name":"Kouider Medjahed","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Kouider","credit_id":"5308efa7925141785e0004a6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1295581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Djalila Kadi-Hanifi","original_name":"Djalila Kadi-Hanifi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Malek's wife","credit_id":"5308efaf925141111a0021bd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1295578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ahmed Benaissa","original_name":"Ahmed Benaissa","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":"/1HZVYS7CjOOos1Sy8lBKt6NF5bB.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Lakhdar","credit_id":"60b552e450f7ca007a1bdd12","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72198,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tariq Teguia","original_name":"Tariq Teguia","popularity":0.0619,"profile_path":"/lRYapG5J5SVEJHsb6iTpp9HmaT3.jpg","credit_id":"52fe44e09251416c75043fb5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1158026,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andrée Davanture","original_name":"Andrée Davanture","popularity":0.0791,"profile_path":"/uhLcjEf2mNzlORwvfyqGnZS4g7Z.jpg","credit_id":"5d7f187ff0647c06629dd4a7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2398663,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yacine Teguia","original_name":"Yacine Teguia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d7f185cf0647c76299d1796","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1744153,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nasser Medjkane","original_name":"Nasser Medjkane","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d7f1878f0647c06629dd49f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1344582,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rodolphe Molla","original_name":"Rodolphe Molla","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d7f18883c43440997a1b483","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2412090,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hacène Ait Kaci","original_name":"Hacène Ait Kaci","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d7f18703c434406b0a0d65e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72198,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tariq Teguia","original_name":"Tariq Teguia","popularity":0.0619,"profile_path":"/lRYapG5J5SVEJHsb6iTpp9HmaT3.jpg","credit_id":"5d7f1862f0647c06629dd48e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1284577","wikidata_id":"Q3151356","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/atCRi92F71UUciONFPMDHlXTRAC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/474O1w7wY4KQ35PSYBy5C1SANCb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8RN5zkUFmxQcn8GSsb35FHjdPQk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB (Venice)","release_date":"2008-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
