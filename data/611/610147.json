Small communities of survivors begin to form. We see one huddling together on a stage. Saved by the coolness of its members, the community does its utmost to preserve it. It is the condition of their continued survival. Despite these efforts their clique gets infected. Fractions emerge, the uncool get banished, the cool stay and dance til the end. The film is part stand-alone fiction, part documentary interpretation of the work of the theatre collective Vibes.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"EU","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1881708,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaakko Pallasvuo","original_name":"Jaakko Pallasvuo","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d0bafc3c3a36862fa1eec56","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
