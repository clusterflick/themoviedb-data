Chuck goes to the D. A.'s home to threaten him, but is taken off guard when his victim's little daughter leans trustfully on his knee and looks up at him with a smile. The D. A. ignores Chuck's warning, and the gang orders the gunman to execute him. Chuck breaks into the house, but sees the little girl again and is unable to complete his task. Instead, he seeks out his girl friend, Annie Mangan, a Salvation Army reformer, and swears to end his life of crime.","popularity":0.2162,"poster_path":"/cEyPMTpeefq0V4ZSSqg2gjg0CWV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Terror","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mulhall","original_name":"Jack Mulhall","popularity":0.3,"profile_path":"/4r33PICmACJZ2Bjum0v1EkvOxbx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Chuck Connelly","credit_id":"5e16389a66565a0012100755","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2504365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace MacLaren","original_name":"Grace MacLaren","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Maggie Connelly","credit_id":"5e1638a21f748b0012846f20","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1360620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Lee","original_name":"Virginia Lee","popularity":0.062,"profile_path":"/uVcRbrap2yNu5dUZqOlJsexkUnZ.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Annie Mangan","credit_id":"626d38a1fcadb41bb6fccd9b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2306690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malcolm Blevins","original_name":"Malcolm Blevins","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Jim Canford","credit_id":"5e1638af1d01910013f01181","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2357972,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hugh Hoffman","original_name":"Hugh Hoffman","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Jerome Travers","credit_id":"5e1638b711386c0013c7dac5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3247,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noble Johnson","original_name":"Noble Johnson","popularity":0.6984,"profile_path":"/ktN2dIxPBTdt7RqpFoWD0upCbUp.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mike Tregurtha","credit_id":"619573551feac10042b2e404","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Hersholt","original_name":"Jean Hersholt","popularity":0.2104,"profile_path":"/aQ7HTIXEmlnwghYvWk5NS8NBI5M.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Jimm, the Dope","credit_id":"6195736655b0c00086e0bb36","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1031882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evelyn Selbie","original_name":"Evelyn Selbie","popularity":0.1514,"profile_path":"/l75Ol7KP1ku0K8ErZ46qW7bjWag.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Mrs. Connelly","credit_id":"61957374be7f3500429f0895","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1406784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Wells","original_name":"Raymond Wells","popularity":0.0934,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e16388166565a00160fea62","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1406784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Wells","original_name":"Raymond Wells","popularity":0.0934,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1638891d01910015f014dc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52173,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fred Myton","original_name":"Fred Myton","popularity":0.1496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e16389311386c0013c7da24","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0008664","wikidata_id":"Q104868129","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cEyPMTpeefq0V4ZSSqg2gjg0CWV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1917-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
