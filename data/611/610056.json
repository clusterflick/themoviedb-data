One night, Kenneth and Esther hide Bert, who has escaped from the police. The same night, Kenneth's father is murdered. The evidence implicates Kenneth, who cannot supply his whereabouts at the time of the crime, as that would give away Bert. Esther cannot clear Kenneth for the same reason, and because it would let her husband know that she was with her former sweetheart.","popularity":0.156,"poster_path":"/ojCtWnAJvZdvL5ljj5CrmETOGxW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"},{"id":118095,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Feather Photoplays","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Black Sheep of the Family","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":559680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francelia Billington","original_name":"Francelia Billington","popularity":0.235,"profile_path":"/273n4j88dNdgCLNWebxF67TfDWz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Esther Saunders","credit_id":"5d32402ecaab6d1640a6595d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Holt","original_name":"Jack Holt","popularity":0.1284,"profile_path":"/4xfh3Mlpqx8tZ991rhVTov0ILtN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Kenneth Carmont","credit_id":"5d3240342f8d090010d8e59a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1419860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mina Cunard","original_name":"Mina Cunard","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":"/tVAn7LMsSSYiBoLNYgF8j9YO8CI.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Bertha Carmont (as Mina Jeffreys)","credit_id":"5ebccfcb8586780021e303f5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"C.
