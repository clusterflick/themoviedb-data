To avoid testifying against Lee, Don leaves town, but after he is gone, Lee double-crosses Don and blames him for the shooting. Then, Don's sweetheart, Miss Lady, heartbroken to learn that Don is a criminal, marries the elderly Professor Querrington. To take her mind off her mundane marriage, Miss Lady befriends a mute boy and pays for an operation that restores his speech. The professor dies, and soon after Don, unaware of his alleged guilt, returns to town to find himself charged with Lee's crime.","popularity":0.1452,"poster_path":"/1ORlDBqij1xFSm2emC311pBMiQb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"},{"id":118095,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Feather Photoplays","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Romance of Billy Goat Hill","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Romance of Billy Goat Hill","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1188045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Myrtle Gonzalez","original_name":"Myrtle Gonzalez","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/fAyit0rK5Xu9Yj9w21UHnjxNbIa.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Miss Lady","credit_id":"5ebcabe5076ce8001f73ba6a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1175461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Val Paul","original_name":"Val Paul","popularity":0.1703,"profile_path":"/wEz8whPa5b69fgZle9HEwrZrEjz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Don Morley","credit_id":"5ebcabeb3d3557001ddb172f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":951261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Hernandez","original_name":"George Hernandez","popularity":0.1105,"profile_path":"/qDb0rmbrShNUnopaFIx18hwugFL.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Colonel Bob Carsey","credit_id":"5ebcabf33d3557001cdb4e9d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Church","original_name":"Fred Church","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/bKUsCS5HL6Rfj45ZGAafyjTxDlI.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lee Diullingham","credit_id":"5ebcabfac50ad2002583eed3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Jefferson","original_name":"Thomas Jefferson","popularity":0.0558,"profile_path":"/gex6qMoUTPOXUeaR3QAuJ0el2Na.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Professor Querrington","credit_id":"5ebcac023d3557001edb8bd4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1476426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frankie Lee","original_name":"Frankie Lee","popularity":0.1152,"profile_path":"/cGqqasAH7DB29Zphl1SVv76kBcF.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Bertie","credit_id":"670de0c6d5f93a3da0bc120f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1307855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Curtis","original_name":"Jack Curtis","popularity":0.0813,"profile_path":"/huntTbXIEl8GPyFkM3FJ6LB96wY.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Sheely","credit_id":"670de0ddb15d97b1a93d5fac","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2306696,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Clyde R.
