Everything in his life happens according to his plan. He is a brilliant lawyer, winning all hopeless cases thanks to his informal connections with supreme authorities. He is also happy in his private life: his virtuous wife and two adopted twin siblings love and admire him. One day, that harmony crumbles. A force major arises on his way to the perfect future. Suddenly, his children are found to have a severe genetic disease that they inherited from one of their biological parents. It means they both will soon become disabled. What will he do? Will he accept this circumstance and bury his plans for a perfect life. Or, will he defy this destiny and castle the pieces on the chessboard to reverse the game's course in his favor? How many figures will he sacrifice before he realizes he himself is a pawn in someone's higher-level game?","popularity":0.0646,"poster_path":"/ikLxyMNrFIeTJ6UFjGR0SOviQcj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159347,"logo_path":null,"name":"Second
