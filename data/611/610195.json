One day they overheard the neighbor talking about a market selling gingerbread, cotton candy and many other goodies. \"Gingerbread,\" beamed Krümel. \"Our old lady loves to eat gingerbread!\" \"Me too,\" said the icing on the cake.  \"We'll go to the market and get a gingerbread heart,\" suggested Krümel. “And then we'll give it to our old lady for her birthday.”  But the trader in the market had no sympathy for three little Dalmatians who just wanted to put their gingerbread hearts in their pockets. He called the police and had the dogs taken to an animal shelter. Only the icing on the cake could escape and she decided to free her friends.","popularity":0.1009,"poster_path":"/7a6RLJfkLhjMGd64stqMTNij8Qb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47629,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dingo Pictures","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2003-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An unlicensed spiritual sequel to Disney's 101 Dalmatians.","title":"Dalmatians 3","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Dalmatians 2","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Even More Dalmatians","type":"translation"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2343091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Armin Drogat","original_name":"Armin Drogat","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Kruemel","credit_id":"5d0bcceec3a368063a1ef047","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2934812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georg Feils","original_name":"Georg Feils","popularity":0.0981,"profile_path":"/ijdWNcZcOjwkJCk57niTUU50Bp1.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Various (voice)","credit_id":"60dbf19f960cde005d2ad0e2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3141174,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hanna Kandler","original_name":"Hanna Kandler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Various (voice)","credit_id":"60dbf1acb458b8007dffd814","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1298898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roswitha Haas","original_name":"Roswitha Haas","popularity":0.1174,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dbf11f32489b0081cfcc0a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1298898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roswitha Haas","original_name":"Roswitha Haas","popularity":0.1174,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dbf12b960cde005d2acf93","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1378665,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ludwig Ickert","original_name":"Ludwig Ickert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dbf13aa1285600469d7442","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1378665,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ludwig Ickert","original_name":"Ludwig Ickert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dbf186bd588b0045fd9763","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5874326","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oWjKCqy4xiZgj2Zi4FbGcxLFdzs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cLOeyjkyjrtsoftzeQlGPxzeBQf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1313,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/7a6RLJfkLhjMGd64stqMTNij8Qb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":875},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1485,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/7bGGUUwfD0UBMLShzzOXUjbnv40.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":990},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/cVtokPFYzYlBmFB9NJZ0qYKhmML.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2003-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
