The war started in 2014, when thousands of pro-European rioters forced the removal of the President. What followed was Russian annexing Crimea and armed pro-Russian separatists rising up in the Donbass region of Ukraine.  Since the start of the conflict, hundreds of international volunteers have travelled to the region to take up arms on both sides. This documentary focuses on why these volunteers think they can make a difference in Emile's second documentary on volunteers fighting in someone else's war.  An honest, raw documentary that gets to the grassroots of the conflict. Emile goes to the frontline of Ukraine in search of these volunteers to find out the truth of the Ukrainian war.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/qFSdgs1wAyRL1aLt4krXQAnIZZU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Robin Hood Complex: Europe's Forgotten War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2343022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emile Ghessen","original_name":"Emile Ghessen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/hAtVLvkgiFJbv3VruUZ092xEyVT.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d0ba799c3a36862fa1ede1d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2343022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emile Ghessen","original_name":"Emile Ghessen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/hAtVLvkgiFJbv3VruUZ092xEyVT.jpg","credit_id":"62265e7537b3a9004625b1fb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2343022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emile Ghessen","original_name":"Emile Ghessen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/hAtVLvkgiFJbv3VruUZ092xEyVT.jpg","credit_id":"62265e79d11e0e006c449871","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2343022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emile Ghessen","original_name":"Emile Ghessen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/hAtVLvkgiFJbv3VruUZ092xEyVT.jpg","credit_id":"5d0ba7a7c3a36862fa1ede23","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10515786","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qFSdgs1wAyRL1aLt4krXQAnIZZU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
