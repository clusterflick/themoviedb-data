Sixty years after \"THE PLANETS\" was written, internationally renowned keyboard artist and composer Isao Tomita created a highly popular electronic version of the Holst suite. It is \"THE TOMITA PLANETS\" that award-winning Director Don Barrett has chosen for the soundtrack of his musical video grand tour of the Solar System.","popularity":0.0741,"poster_path":"/qZSO3wJBKyEW1H90eSiFtfEynIu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Planets","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2346283,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Don Barrett","original_name":"Don Barrett","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d0ffaf5c3a368063a25522c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2346286,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jacqueline S.
