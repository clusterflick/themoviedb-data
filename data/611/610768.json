When Kate falls sick, the prudish Philemon hires Miss Summerville, a live-in nurse, to care for her, but is concerned about possible gossip. To alleviate the situation, each keeper and Dr. Carlyle propose to Miss Summerville, but she rejects them all. After hearing that Captain Peyton, a lighthouse inspector, is scheduled to arrive, Miss Summerville makes sudden plans to depart without explanation. At the urging of Carlyle, she agrees to stay, but tries to avoid Peyton by turning off the lighthouse beacon.","popularity":0.0881,"poster_path":"/iiPZvKnlggNfyu28FHsZLgq5kJ9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Silent Lady","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1378005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gretchen Lederer","original_name":"Gretchen Lederer","popularity":0.06,"profile_path":"/8UZKLwtV5vcC0EBZYVFHRAIHzJD.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5d322fc01d78f2000fe1a67e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1637163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoe Rae","original_name":"Zoe Rae","popularity":0.1282,"profile_path":"/edT6F4HPcUfAijHSZRlfoLzVy6o.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5d322fc62f8d095259d81f4f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108105,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Winter Hall","original_name":"Winter Hall","popularity":0.1588,"profile_path":"/jDN707Y6PhbruDCGGHkvpuFSTmc.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5d322fcc1d78f20010e19f3c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1365321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Holden","original_name":"Harry Holden","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5d322fd26a300b11afa3ab63","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1419861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
