The first part, entitled J'explique certaines choses, is in Spanish with French subtitles, and shows us more precisely the lifestyle of a group of Chileans. In Slowly, which forms the second part, we are asked, through Lucia, a young Chilean exile, the problem of integration into a new social environment. Finally, Jours de fer (Steel Blues), the third and only part available in English, is a cruel reminder of the harsh condition of the uprooted man who must find work at all costs to ensure his survival.","popularity":0.5987,"poster_path":"/lLVvOGKNgSKhJcMkyUyQr6ndEMO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"There is no forgetting","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Il n’y a pas d’oubli","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1563514,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Enrique Sandoval","original_name":"Enrique Sandoval","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5eff1b06f0317400395412d2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":588034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuel Aranguiz","original_name":"Manuel Aranguiz","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/8qUN7ce0f8MQr93hZeX7WaaBAgb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5eff1b20be7f350035aa2a12","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillermo Díaz","original_name":"Guillermo Díaz","popularity":1.1107,"profile_path":"/oso3tpCcf6wbjeHk2bpeKMV52zP.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5eff1b4f7b7b4d0037593e2d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2700007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mónica Escobar","original_name":"Mónica Escobar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5eff1b737b7b4d00355cab53","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2346573,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodrigo Gonzalez","original_name":"Rodrigo Gonzalez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d105e27c3a3682f6824e1a0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1348324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marilú Mallet","original_name":"Marilú Mallet","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/e6mfogPIk15ngXAfYbzIKzzFqdN.jpg","credit_id":"5d105d190e0a26597dc9cd4a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2346572,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Fajardo","original_name":"Jorge Fajardo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d105ca0c3a3681e231e0f89","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0208221","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lLVvOGKNgSKhJcMkyUyQr6ndEMO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4849,"name":"exile"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"1975-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
