The show was held at the Center Stage Theater, the same location where most of WCW's regular TBS show WCW Saturday Night were taped at the time. It was also the final wrestling TV appearance for Andre The Giant, who died several months later.","popularity":1.5816,"poster_path":"/pHX4HavkG41byn45EhQgWU1dhC1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13510,"logo_path":"/1G5tOhMyzIwl4CboqUZ9dvWwbbu.png","name":"World Championship
