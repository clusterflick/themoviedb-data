Director and crew travelled all around the country with the ambitious goal of documenting all the aspects of the local life at the time. Fishing plays an important role (being then, by far, the number one national industry); one can also witness the humble beginnings of 'city-life' in the capital, one of the first (or was it the very first?) cars driving in Iceland, beautiful pastoral shots of farm-lands, ladies posing in the national costume, as well as fighters indulging in the national sport, 'glyma'. The 21st century traveller will be able to recognize a number of landmarks. The images are often naive, genuine, and captivating. In my opinion one of the most valuable Icelandic films. --Ewolve","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/jpDPFYNN2vEeVVIGJJ1a2RZKnoI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"1925-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Iceland in Moving Pictures","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Iceland in Living Pictures","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732988,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Loftur Guðmundsson","original_name":"Loftur Guðmundsson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d0ea7c49251413cc5b9d049","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10397972","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"is","file_path":"/jpDPFYNN2vEeVVIGJJ1a2RZKnoI.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qb3ZCv1gSlVy66ZuJcmxfHkNgYm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1925-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
