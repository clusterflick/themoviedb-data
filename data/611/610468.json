Blocked from shooting inside prison walls, the filmmakers ask former inmates, guards and bystanders to describe their experience with the institution. Their feature is a crucial part of a broad constellation of projects – a post-68 vérité wave – in which women, immigrants, factory workers, and other marginalized groups began using film and video to analyze their position within global struggles. Incarceration is one factor that ties these struggles together: “None of us is sure to escape prison,” Foucault wrote in the GIP manifesto, “Today less than ever.”","popularity":0.0604,"poster_path":"/wecVolqEtLqaiuKNAWtmt3S9iTt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1975-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les prisons aussi...","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hélène Chatelain","original_name":"Hélène Chatelain","popularity":0.1127,"profile_path":"/yYOw9tgmpG5PExnlfg728iKKBmJ.jpg","credit_id":"5d0d47d69251415534b8f841","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2344238,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"René Lefort","original_name":"René Lefort","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d0d47ec9251413945bb6ddb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1275774","wikidata_id":"Q106519061","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wecVolqEtLqaiuKNAWtmt3S9iTt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
