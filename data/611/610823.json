The film eschews any biographical structure and instead looks at the ways these two artists are bound by time and light. Lawrence Jordan and Joanna McClure have extensive bodies of work between them. The film interweaves Joanna’s poetry, Lawrence’s films, personal interviews, and emotive imagery to produce a sensory engagement with a long lasting friendship and artistic practice.  An understanding of mortality is ever present and the film let’s that feeling permeate throughout. How does one relate to years of love, friendship, and art? How does it resonate in the present moment?  In the film, there is a sense of boundlessness and understanding that indeed, time dissolves all boundaries until there is only the possibility of light.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/t8lYi4ORM7Oxsazocxs9WWtLaEY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103923,"logo_path":"/hYSCMp5QIbvjeHs5cgFvA0hD88K.png","name":"Piercing Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Encounters in Light","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1903817,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joanna McClure","original_name":"Joanna McClure","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"The Poet","credit_id":"5d0f9d6ec3a3680e63206290","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":267634,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lawrence Jordan","original_name":"Lawrence Jordan","popularity":0.2613,"profile_path":"/nELFCK1hpF0pmhRSQy9EdWrVG6R.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"The Filmmaker","credit_id":"5d0fa5aa9251412f8fb950e1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2345932,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Maxwell Cantrell","original_name":"Maxwell Cantrell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d0fa5c5925141779dbd085f","department":"Sound","job":"Foley Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1880131,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aniello De Angelis","original_name":"Aniello De Angelis","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/fUyIrEcgbPdkML7rqksImfu3eyF.jpg","credit_id":"5d0f9bbc0e0a263dddd0ce88","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2345932,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Maxwell Cantrell","original_name":"Maxwell Cantrell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d0fa5d10e0a263296d09485","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2345892,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jack Hogan","original_name":"Jack Hogan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d0f9d470e0a261092cce61d","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2762862,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Devin Jie Allen","original_name":"Devin Jie Allen","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/u3rBDokKqgJG8mjCps7YVJfly6R.jpg","credit_id":"5f4ea7e2202e110033220a58","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2762862,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Devin Jie Allen","original_name":"Devin Jie Allen","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/u3rBDokKqgJG8mjCps7YVJfly6R.jpg","credit_id":"5f4ea7f439756100355a8f5f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2762862,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Devin Jie Allen","original_name":"Devin Jie Allen","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/u3rBDokKqgJG8mjCps7YVJfly6R.jpg","credit_id":"5f4ea7d29ecf1800389c4c43","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1624,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t8lYi4ORM7Oxsazocxs9WWtLaEY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1218}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ann Arbor Film Festival","release_date":"2021-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
