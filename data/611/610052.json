Richard thwarts them, largely through the help of Charles Dalton, but then Charles tries to seduce Elinor, Richard's wife. Although she rebuffs Charles, Richard accuses her of infidelity, so Elinor leaves him and goes to Paris. Richard follows her, but, caught in the middle of the 1870 riots, he cannot get near her. Charles, also in Paris, finally convinces Richard that nothing had come of his interest in Elinor, but Richard now believes that Elinor no longer loves him.","popularity":0.2567,"poster_path":"/xwRkexvlNCYjTnw5Dxo6vbBWP5I.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Friday","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1410767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Morris","original_name":"Richard Morris","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Richard Strong","credit_id":"5ebc983c076ce8002073d1ea","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":103924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Davenport","original_name":"Dorothy Davenport","popularity":0.1278,"profile_path":"/mS2sibbJ4046yDGmocE43LRWeil.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Elionor Rossitor","credit_id":"5ebc98428586780021e214f8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2637667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilfred Rogers","original_name":"Wilfred Rogers","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Edwin Rossitor","credit_id":"5ebc984a3d3557001ddaf456","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1387034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Maurice","original_name":"Mary Maurice","popularity":0.0727,"profile_path":"/rljSgfrSJetffMW7ZNhjQVmcjcg.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mrs. Rossitor","credit_id":"5ebc98563d3557001edb4db8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1023434,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emory Johnson","original_name":"Emory Johnson","popularity":0.0794,"profile_path":"/bhjxPzKIyVslP87KkDyDpUJoTks.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Charles Dalton","credit_id":"5ebc98638e2e00001f105927","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1378005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gretchen Lederer","original_name":"Gretchen Lederer","popularity":0.06,"profile_path":"/8UZKLwtV5vcC0EBZYVFHRAIHzJD.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Zoldene","credit_id":"62044cc90dea6e0048129015","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2192633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Southern","original_name":"Virginia Southern","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Posie Stanton","credit_id":"62044cd9fd4f8001078d9681","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1014296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Fenton","original_name":"Mark Fenton","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Jim Fisk","credit_id":"62044cf085005d00421a7eef","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1276097,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frederic S.
