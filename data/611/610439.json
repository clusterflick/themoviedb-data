Esta es mi Cara – This is My Face explores what happens when a group of men living with the virus open up about the chronic disease that changed their life trajectories. The film follows a creative process whereby the protagonists produce photographic portraits that represent their (often painful) memories and feelings, a process that helps them challenge years of silence, shame, and misrepresentations. A lesson in the power of collaborative storytelling.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/ulKBR23Wn7w1kS8b80YaeCOWatJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119917,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cerebro Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2019-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What lies inside a journey with HIV","title":"This Is My Face","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2110444,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nicolás Sepúlveda","original_name":"Nicolás Sepúlveda","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d0d26920e0a264871cbd71b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2110444,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nicolás Sepúlveda","original_name":"Nicolás Sepúlveda","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d0d267dc3a3682f681fd463","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2549659,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angélica Cabezas Pino","original_name":"Angélica Cabezas Pino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e54c638f48b34001374d96c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2549659,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angélica Cabezas Pino","original_name":"Angélica Cabezas Pino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e54c64835811d00195bb5a2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2549659,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angélica Cabezas Pino","original_name":"Angélica Cabezas Pino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e54c617a93d2500134e7898","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2549659,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angélica Cabezas Pino","original_name":"Angélica Cabezas Pino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e54c624f48b34001374d940","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9346708","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.66,"height":909,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/ulKBR23Wn7w1kS8b80YaeCOWatJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
