Solakhan roams every inch of the city, witnessing separate instances of standing stones, balloons, kites, cars, roads, and neighborhoods with her camera, whilst looking into the city’s nature, yesterday and today. The city from her perspective is intertwined with history. An essay film as well as a documentary, The City is a daring gaze on Istanbul. The movie goes beyond observation to working through and reflecting on the city, with no hesitation in bestowing a new image on it and seeing it in a new light.","popularity":0.0823,"poster_path":"/gLBf3zAYkezMbYH1YecuNztPGgy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31052,"logo_path":"/pJgQoO1PyJdhOP1UOrVsDeolYw7.png","name":"Deutsche Film- und Fernsehakademie Berlin (DFFB)","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The City","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Die Stadt","type":"Alternate"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3630590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aygen Baktır","original_name":"Aygen Baktır","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62d77a848a0e9b005986dea3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3630591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kahraman Baktır","original_name":"Kahraman Baktır","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62d77a94cb71b80071d728ee","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1296131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nevzat Açıkgöz","original_name":"Nevzat Açıkgöz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/wI2HY1QMfATaJnX0isoyIdrnHEV.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"62d77ba6498ef90124cfc8b9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3630596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fahri Zeki Güldüren","original_name":"Fahri Zeki Güldüren","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"62d79c32498ef901265d1c01","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3630598,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Duygu Tansı","original_name":"Duygu Tansı","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"","credit_id":"62d79c37caa50800677be1cc","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3630592,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sezai Tülübaş","original_name":"Sezai Tülübaş","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d77b38f9475b005d20f6d6","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":72146,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Thomas Balkenhol","original_name":"Thomas Balkenhol","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d77ae98a0e9b00513fc73f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1758298,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Martin Manz","original_name":"Martin Manz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d77afecaa508004c47d6da","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1574554,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Merlyn Ecer","original_name":"Merlyn Ecer","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d77adf77e1f6004da0be93","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1574554,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Merlyn Ecer","original_name":"Merlyn Ecer","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d77af403bf84004def406b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1159557,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joachim Rothe","original_name":"Joachim Rothe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d77b30caa508004fffe92c","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1758298,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Martin Manz","original_name":"Martin Manz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d77ad35c3247004d990379","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1758298,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Martin Manz","original_name":"Martin Manz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d79c281283e9004e13aa2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1574554,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Merlyn Ecer","original_name":"Merlyn Ecer","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d0d32920e0a267c5ecbc3e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gLBf3zAYkezMbYH1YecuNztPGgy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
