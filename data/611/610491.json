A gang of Norwegian children do what Norwegian children like best - ski. They are actually rescuing Norwegian gold from the nazi invaders. The Nazis search all adults but don't suspect children playing. The children carry the gold, one bar at a time, across the mountains to a fishing boat. It is a race against time, it is spring and the snow is melting. So they ski from dawn to dusk every day.","popularity":0.6577,"poster_path":"/54lSDwJQGULchRFUhF2FioeUhZx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18170,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sagittarius Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1968-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Snow Treasure","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Снежное сокровище","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"O Tesouro na Neve","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Thisavroi sta hionia","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Snow Treasure","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2344423,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Austad","original_name":"Paul Austad","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Peter Lundstrom","credit_id":"5d0d7253c3a368168221bb78","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2344424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tina Austad","original_name":"Tina Austad","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Peter's Sister","credit_id":"5d0d7270c3a3682f6820464c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":227290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilfred Breistrand","original_name":"Wilfred Breistrand","popularity":0.0829,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Captain Kantzeler","credit_id":"5d0d72ecc3a36828e61dea2c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Franciscus","original_name":"James Franciscus","popularity":0.5341,"profile_path":"/wvu1kkLNnvWTz6G0JoxSFCf1BxR.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"2nd Lt.
