The film is divided into three parts, following the division of the poem The Divine Comedy, the chronology of Danteâ€™s trip through Hell, Purgatory and Paradise is respected. During this travel his human body is reconstructed and reorganised into a new body freed from his organism and from his organs. This new body, in touch with Beatrice, and by his ascension, becomes point of circulation of flows and intensities of all kinds.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":"/dHrwXsNSyNUfx9pIW4WQy0Zt9pi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il n'y a rien de plus inutile qu'un organe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2336272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Augustin Gimel","original_name":"Augustin Gimel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/b5F44gmEibkGLUEif8EEipcdHLk.jpg","credit_id":"5d0f04a20e0a2602a1cd3f0c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/dHrwXsNSyNUfx9pIW4WQy0Zt9pi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Augustin Gimel, Il n'y a Rien de Plus Inutile qu'un Organe (Full Film)","key":"71429871","site":"Vimeo","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2013-07-31T15:20:44.000Z","id":"5d0f0506c3a3680a6f21c8f9"}]}}}
