His singular career has taken him from Carnegie Hall to The Sydney Opera House, to countless television appearances and a million online “hits.” TAYLOR has blazed his own trail of unique entertainment, resulting in a schedule jam-packed with performances in every venue for every audience, and is one of a very few who can succeed in comedy clubs, churches, theaters, cruise ships, and for corporate clients that range from Fortune 500 companies to small businesses. Blending observational humor, keen musicianship, state-of-the-art ventriloquism and (most recently) magic effects, TAYLOR MASON presents a positive, hilarious, unforgettable program that connects people thru those things that bond us: laughter, music and the shared experience of something special, something original and something unforgettable.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/3wUxQfYro0qcwp9h8PNdHwY6rq0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taylor Mason: Hysterical Perspective","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3wUxQfYro0qcwp9h8PNdHwY6rq0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
