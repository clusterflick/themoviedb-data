The lack of ready cash to pay his loyal employees, wholesale produce providers and a whole range of other creditors, including the tax-gobbling French government, is omnipresent. From a staff of 14, Jihad is down to three cooks, one delivery driver and a secretary in less than six months. The good-natured pluck of the remaining employees is at the heart of the film. Subterfuges for putting up a brave united front include scheduling food orders from a coin-operated pay phone when the office phone is cut off for nonpayment.","popularity":0.3147,"poster_path":"/qPHFtFgouWqhjd9VOgZc53R17Iy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1848,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les","origin_country":""},{"id":11332,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Sept-Arte","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1995-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"At All Costs","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":56211,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claire Simon","original_name":"Claire Simon","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":"/eN0t1PF8o2eCmRWJQme6KIBdSde.jpg","credit_id":"5a0fbccdc3a368628f020527","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1293147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisabeth Legrand","original_name":"Elisabeth Legrand","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a0fbd7192514138f3022e1b","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732447,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dominique Lancelot","original_name":"Dominique Lancelot","popularity":0.0787,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a0fbd45c3a368628c01e2f6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1925564,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anne-Marguerite Monory","original_name":"Anne-Marguerite Monory","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a0fbd8bc3a36862890215bb","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41793,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Serge Lalou","original_name":"Serge Lalou","popularity":0.1421,"profile_path":"/lJgdWev2t6vJL6I3984sFu92Nuk.jpg","credit_id":"5a0fbceb92514138ea0222c9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1925563,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sophie Creusot","original_name":"Sophie Creusot","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a0fbd62c3a3686289021598","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56244,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Richard Copans","original_name":"Richard Copans","popularity":0.1466,"profile_path":"/c6zkFdzQW6mQdYDMTdUVO1BVC2k.jpg","credit_id":"5a0fbcddc3a368628c01e27a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":55809,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jérôme Peyrebrune","original_name":"Jérôme Peyrebrune","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a0fbd0892514138f90210ad","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1548328,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Patrick Dumont","original_name":"Patrick Dumont","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a0fbd35c3a368628002464d","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":56211,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claire Simon","original_name":"Claire Simon","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":"/eN0t1PF8o2eCmRWJQme6KIBdSde.jpg","credit_id":"5a0fbd14c3a368628c01e2c9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":551787,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Catherine Quesemand","original_name":"Catherine Quesemand","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a0fbd2592514138ea02230b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur H.","original_name":"Arthur H","popularity":0.2513,"profile_path":"/juiUJ0LLZ20ll0uS83fNLX4r557.jpg","credit_id":"5a0fbcfac3a3686283022e85","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0112728","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":876,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/qPHFtFgouWqhjd9VOgZc53R17Iy.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":584},{"aspect_ratio":0.623,"height":802,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gUB3cviVO2FeyjpwX4QYZm8cNp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":876,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/yIiqqctAVAeHo0xPtUcKLL8JCKV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":584}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1996-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"IDFA Festival","release_date":"1995-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
