To hell. Five film-making teams embarked on a journey around the world, to tell creative and personal stories of people inhabiting contemporary hells; from the alleged entrance to the abyss of the damned in a distant Russia, American theme-park-like town called Hell, a house converted to a morbid vision of Buddhist underworld in Japan and deadly sulfur lake in Indonesia, to a dark - present day Congo. Visually stunning and provoking documentary \"Searching For Hell\" leads you through devil's territory and enables you to see what it can be in the modern world.","popularity":0.0987,"poster_path":"/6E9D3DfeqAqwKwHkfSVOFb69SKI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Searching For Hell","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1925997,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomasz Adamski","original_name":"Tomasz Adamski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61953b7ebb10570063531da2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1925997,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomasz Adamski","original_name":"Tomasz Adamski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61953b733e09f30094055fb0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1925994,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuki Nakamura","original_name":"Yuki Nakamura","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a10dbcfc3a368628c03737c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1925995,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pawel Nazaruk","original_name":"Pawel Nazaruk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a10dbe392514138ea03d94c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1925997,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomasz Adamski","original_name":"Tomasz Adamski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a10dbef92514138ea03d963","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1925992,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Kenney","original_name":"James Kenney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a10db97c3a368628f03b2cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1925993,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gloria Kurnik","original_name":"Gloria Kurnik","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a10dba492514138e703ee17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1925991,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darek Barecki","original_name":"Darek Barecki","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/7fV5SGdaauSEUS70iPiESV3DQ6a.jpg","credit_id":"5a10db53c3a368628903c5e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4461922","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6E9D3DfeqAqwKwHkfSVOFb69SKI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
