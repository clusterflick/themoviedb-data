His first films made specifically for theatrical release, and his first for a major studio, the “Black Society Trilogy” was the beginning of Mike’s mature career as a filmmaker and they remain among the prolific director’s finest works.  Here he sits down to talk about his career.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ph9wfQjGAvvbIWJNKukibgKhqka.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Takashi Miike: Into the Black","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6549882","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.743,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ph9wfQjGAvvbIWJNKukibgKhqka.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1188}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
