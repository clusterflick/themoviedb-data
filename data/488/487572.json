These large-scale projects, based on economic growth, also have human costs that change the cultural face of the regions on a small or large scale. Over a six-month period, three families from the Acadian Peninsula in New Brunswick opened their doors and hearts to director Renée Blanchar and her team. A film about exile, choice of life, values, but especially absence; absence being probably the highest price to pay for each member of these families.","popularity":0.6641,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":97450,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ça tourne production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nos hommes dans l'Ouest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1925111,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Renée Blanchar","original_name":"Renée Blanchar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a0ec38392514138ea00de1a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1925111,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Renée Blanchar","original_name":"Renée Blanchar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a0ec39292514138ea00de28","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1150159,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Philippe Lavalette","original_name":"Philippe Lavalette","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/dYLlO9plY6MFeDkls8FPl4uQZS8.jpg","credit_id":"5a0ec3bfc3a368627d00f606","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421900,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Elric Robichon","original_name":"Elric Robichon","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a0ec3d2c3a368628600e717","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1925112,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simon Doucet","original_name":"Simon Doucet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a0ec3eb92514138f300df19","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18035,"name":"family"},{"id":181650,"name":"alberta canada"},{"id":211158,"name":"absent parent"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
