She travels to Buenos Aires to meet him, but he never shows up. She begins to investigate and learns about The Corroborators, a secret society that, at the end of the 19th Century, intended to turn Buenos Aires into an exact replica of Paris. In the 30s, they disappeared, but she believes that they are behind the disappearance of Dressler. And that they are after her.","popularity":0.1079,"poster_path":"/bUrrXSptB988rfBEuD84G0Cko0x.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93395,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mulata Films","origin_country":""},{"id":13449,"logo_path":"/jVqRkSBiksaZ1Qz4Y73dIbrlNkV.png","name":"PUCARÁ cine","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2017-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Los corroboradores","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2665777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrée Leonet","original_name":"Andrée Leonet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Suzanne","credit_id":"5ed9247ee4b576001e364788","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2517258,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Juan Carlos Altamirano","original_name":"Juan Carlos Altamirano","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ed92365e4b576002039dfce","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2665771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Schávelzon","original_name":"Daniel Schávelzon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ed92394e4b576002039dffd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1597270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rafael Cippolini","original_name":"Rafael Cippolini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ed923ad96e30b0022970c19","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2665772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriel DiMeglio","original_name":"Gabriel DiMeglio","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ed923ce96e30b00219690a1","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1757082,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luis Bernárdez","original_name":"Luis Bernárdez","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/jqEfdGJInXzkMsCjducFR5f1MBA.jpg","credit_id":"5a107d1a92514138f90318ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1757082,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luis Bernárdez","original_name":"Luis Bernárdez","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/jqEfdGJInXzkMsCjducFR5f1MBA.jpg","credit_id":"5ed922ad96e30b0020979c50","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1031007,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pedro Irusta","original_name":"Pedro Irusta","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/i2FkYmCWGLYUoHBdeUzMb7PxJ8z.jpg","credit_id":"5ed922c321c4ca0021e7501f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2539955,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"José Maria Gomez","original_name":"José Maria Gomez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed92308fea0d7001e909b67","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7293844","wikidata_id":"Q53849718","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hrBcKvOwmI6VViOBtFILRgVcyQc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bUrrXSptB988rfBEuD84G0Cko0x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":684}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11800,"name":"mockumentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Mar del Plata Film Festival - Argentine Competition","release_date":"2017-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Los corroboradores - Tráiler","key":"Hu6ea0FfK8s","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-04-04T05:25:25.000Z","id":"5ed9262c96e30b002297121a"}]}}}
