The craftsmen are shown who make the ball and the bat–that ‘fourth straight stick’ with which the batsmen defend ‘the other three’. The craftsmen are shown who play the game, from W. G. Grace in the ‘nets’ to D. G. Bradman and Denis Compton in the thread of the ‘Test’. The history of the game is epitomized in the Long Room shots at Lord’s and from there the camera moves to the village green; to the London side- street where the urchins play on a ‘bumping pitch’; to South Africa, and India, where in the ‘blinding light’ there is often ‘an hour to play and the last man in.","popularity":0.2677,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10889,"logo_path":null,"name":"British Film Council","origin_country":""},{"id":97504,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Documentary Unit","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1950-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cricket","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Richardson","original_name":"Ralph Richardson","popularity":0.3925,"profile_path":"/rPGUnz38kKtFfYmmEqVAjqZPA10.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator(voice)","credit_id":"5a10998492514138e703804a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1925898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Arlott","original_name":"John Arlott","popularity":0.0766,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator(voice)","credit_id":"5a10998dc3a36862860392f8","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1925899,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Baylis","original_name":"Peter Baylis","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6617ff33e295b4017dafa4ef","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1653873,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Grahame Tharp","original_name":"Grahame Tharp","popularity":0.0869,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a1099a692514138f3038419","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1278335,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Howells","original_name":"Jack Howells","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a1099bd92514138ea0370c4","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1925901,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"George Stevens","original_name":"George Stevens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a109a0492514138f0037b19","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1925902,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alex Milner-Gardner","original_name":"Alex Milner-Gardner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a109a15c3a368627d03c1d8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1925903,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"William S.
