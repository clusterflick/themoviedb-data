It's easier and cheaper to retrieve gold from old computers for instance, than to dig it up. Organics can be used to create fertiliser and green electricity and yet each Australian sends half a tonne of food waste to landfill each year where it is contaminated with chemicals and e-waste. We recycle only 50% of all our waste.  There is an alternative to environmental apocalypse and we don't have to wait for the politicians to make it happen. All we really need to do is be creative and use our imaginations to turn this waste into wealth again. Waste Not talks to scientists, workers at waste depots, environment campaigners, gardeners and even a famous chef about how easy it is to save the planet by simply recycling properly.","popularity":0.6119,"poster_path":"/kN8ZaxU7t6k9yy0vvyfxfFMfa6k.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16577,"logo_path":"/qildaLRTmB6fCBM3H7L02nQCreO.png","name":"Ronin
