Eva Braun was the longtime romantic companion to Adolf Hitler, as well as a photographer and amateur filmmaker. Her 8mm Agfacolor-stock home movies, recorded at her leisure, were seized by the US Army in 1945. They were subsequently assembled into 8 reels, from 28 reels of original camera negatives. The US National Archives received this 8-reel film in 1947, and in 2012 began the digital restoration process.","popularity":0.4284,"poster_path":"/iRtvQzRHiS3A9Xq5UqQCWxsQxhA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Home Movies of Eva Braun","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Secret film Archive of Eva Braun","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Eva Braun Reels","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolf Hitler","original_name":"Adolf Hitler","popularity":0.7926,"profile_path":"/n6f81IUSes1a8jTzUIF7rJ5zZnP.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5a0d4d9a9251416ef200aa3b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":225573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Braun","original_name":"Eva Braun","popularity":0.4488,"profile_path":"/qYADeqok5fU64c3R7phncimqsRY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5a0d4da6c3a36812ef00aa97","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":225573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Braun","original_name":"Eva Braun","popularity":0.4488,"profile_path":"/qYADeqok5fU64c3R7phncimqsRY.jpg","credit_id":"5a0d4dc49251416ef000a3b9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7018456","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iRtvQzRHiS3A9Xq5UqQCWxsQxhA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":239660,"name":"home movies"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"VHS","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
