A frontal confrontation, conducted without the help of their allies, army against army, nation against nation. Today, this battle seems absurd to us. Because it has caused almost as many casualties in each camp and its strategic utility has never really been demonstrated. But in 1916, soldiers on both sides did not consider it absurd: they agreed to fight. Why ?\r By reliving the rare Herculean confrontation of our ancestors, using reconstructions made in the 1920s, using a large number of animated computer-generated images that recreate the topography of the battlefield, this documentary returns, with the help of the historical adviser Paul Jankowski , on the last great victory won alone by France against Germany.","popularity":0.3236,"poster_path":"/wTAs5DATkWzN2ONapoeoXSTXs2A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":123263,"logo_path":"/lH6LuTXRNVncmI4fJwohv2FqgpO.png","name":"ECPAD","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":135094,"logo_path":"/ijdZOW28RzIIp26Q7aLMbjcDsMZ.png","name":"Histodoc","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Verdun - They will not pass!","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Verdun, ils ne passeront pas","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1894132,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serge de Sampigny","original_name":"Serge de Sampigny","popularity":0.2123,"profile_path":"/dDggaViO2SipKJ2nPJNDA1D4pIR.jpg","credit_id":"5a14860cc3a36855d6003565","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b7mS50mtvdtKfu7WXGOPRgWuHPe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/wTAs5DATkWzN2ONapoeoXSTXs2A.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/fYC3qoff62Bum4lAr4QiLwBfj1t.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":254,"name":"france"},{"id":2504,"name":"world war i"},{"id":257849,"name":"battle of verdun (1916)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Arte","release_date":"2016-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
