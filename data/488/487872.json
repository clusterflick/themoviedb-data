NATO’S SECRET ARMIES examines three major terror attacks: The Brabant massacres in Belgium, The Oktoberfest bombing in Germany and the Piazza Fontana killings in Italy. Through the testimony of former terrorists, Gladio, ex-CIA agents, diplomats, prosecutors and police investigators the film pieces together the disturbing trail of influence behind each of the attacks and considers whether hundreds may have died at the hands of state sponsored terrorism. More chillingly, it asks whether the strategy of tension might still be in use today.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/3Eo8H7h7LlaariK9HVokf6qYiNp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60547,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mirage Cinematografica","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"NATO's Secret Armies.
