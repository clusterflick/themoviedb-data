Naturally, the no-good karate school wants to get their hands on it, so they send some goons to rough him up every five minutes or so.  He gets a bit fed up with all the non-stop Kung Fu fighting and entrusts the book to a dude named Rey and his comic relief idiot buddy Tito. When the bad guys kidnap Rey’s gal pal, he dons Bruce Lee’s trademark yellow jumpsuit from Game of Death and sets out to rescue her.","popularity":0.1068,"poster_path":"/ym5bHXZJxCJWQoWLNtYSfqBuIJW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"},{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"1979-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"They Call Him Bruce Lee","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"猛龍伏霸","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"부르스리라 불리우는 사나이","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Karate Connection","type":"VHS title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":941614,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rey Malonzo","original_name":"Rey Malonzo","popularity":0.276,"profile_path":"/9MUhOaIypiSAziea6hf0X3nnana.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5a10850192514138f0034d19","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Lee","original_name":"Jack Lee","popularity":0.0707,"profile_path":"/x8pumcuiJ3U5JUbJQt8AdmIPZVy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5a10851192514138f9032931","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1345080,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Gamboa","original_name":"Philip Gamboa","popularity":0.2823,"profile_path":"/nOpGoWdbhWWKvMgzXMKzNkhIonm.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5a10851bc3a368628003794d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1654362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donna Villa","original_name":"Donna Villa","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5a108523c3a36862830358b0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1520230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manny Luna","original_name":"Manny Luna","popularity":0.0583,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5a10852e92514138f3035660","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1324984,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ike Lozada","original_name":"Ike Lozada","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5a10853592514138e40333da","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1925858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Gumabao","original_name":"Sarah Gumabao","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5a10853e92514138f903299a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1073850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Gordon Bell","original_name":"Don Gordon Bell","popularity":0.103,"profile_path":"/jAvxYXAce0uKECsyT3f0mT8TNlC.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5a108548c3a36862800379ca","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1356095,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francis Posadas","original_name":"Francis Posadas","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a1084eac3a3686292030930","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1356095,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francis Posadas","original_name":"Francis Posadas","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a1084e1c3a3686289033296","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4109689,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peter Chiu","original_name":"Peter Chiu","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64887a836f8d95011f238e50","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0483441","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ym5bHXZJxCJWQoWLNtYSfqBuIJW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tl","note":"","release_date":"1979-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
