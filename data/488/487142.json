Niklas Julebukk may still be relatively young, but he's already a real Santa Claus. Unfortunately, he is now stranded with his caravan, the goblins Flybeard and Goatee, the reindeer Shooting Star and even the little angel Matilda. Because Julebukk also does not want to participate in the new-fangled custom of giving children expensive presents, he is also threatened by the nasty Waldemar Wichteltod. Luckily, the two courageous children Ben and Charlotte help him. Together they can save Christmas Eve from the mean gnome and his nutcrackers.","popularity":0.1566,"poster_path":"/cxtz0gn1Ax3p0zyUf3YFFramVy7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Augsburger Puppenkiste: Als der Weihnachtsmann vom Himmel fiel","video":true,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1714760,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Stefaniak","original_name":"Martin Stefaniak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a0b399dc3a368213801c7ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1923818,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julian Köberer","original_name":"Julian Köberer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a0b39aa925141312101eac6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7708734","wikidata_id":"Q60091131","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kIKfeRjTSHIDtmnPokuwERHJvtW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/cxtz0gn1Ax3p0zyUf3YFFramVy7.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1272,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/6vdT7nhjPQR2tvxYGPWXjtQLYw4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":848},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/d1KS9zcx7KRYx6MLgEO8LZ6YQ4A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
