Nellie is asleep in a hammock when Sam, her sweetheart, arrives in his auto. He awakens Nellie with a kiss. As she starts up she drops the necklace in the grass and their efforts to find it prove futile. Sam promises to buy her one to replace it, thinking it was her own properly. He has her minutely describe it that he may get an exact duplicate. Meanwhile, the governess has found the necklace and given it to its owner, Mazie, who is unknown to Sam. He sees it on Mazie's neck and after a chase insists on purchasing it.","popularity":0.6481,"poster_path":"/gi0wbTCQ2Psen95SB2YvEsxLbQt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1910-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Gold Necklace","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Pickford","original_name":"Mary Pickford","popularity":0.6455,"profile_path":"/y0FHoj9AjmVveKkdeFuqhuVYaTf.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Masie","credit_id":"5a11bb4592514138e405228f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":145109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Bruce","original_name":"Kate Bruce","popularity":0.1372,"profile_path":"/oLC99DsB0gkPdsZJRi0d1D1B4hD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Govorness","credit_id":"5a11bb6f92514138e40522d8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1285061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lottie Pickford","original_name":"Lottie Pickford","popularity":0.1216,"profile_path":"/pqDcboPFdE2GT48oXeNZfeAS22u.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Nellie","credit_id":"5a11bb8dc3a368627d05b644","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89518,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mack Sennett","original_name":"Mack Sennett","popularity":0.2719,"profile_path":"/24XTSL0AbuT6gzjqAFhpc4fkEts.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"5a11bb9dc3a3686280058fc1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99378,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dell Henderson","original_name":"Dell Henderson","popularity":0.2378,"profile_path":"/gA4BPbRHPSvI16n1QcRlAd3gmSo.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"In Cafe","credit_id":"5fdd0792458199003fda0a70","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":103924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Davenport","original_name":"Dorothy Davenport","popularity":0.1278,"profile_path":"/mS2sibbJ4046yDGmocE43LRWeil.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"A Friend","credit_id":"5fdd07ad498bc2003e45cf09","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148786,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jeanie Macpherson","original_name":"Jeanie Macpherson","popularity":0.2195,"profile_path":"/nulmuZe4m0edGINH1Me5ix0Ivsl.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"A Friend","credit_id":"5fdd07dc4350110040b0b6f0","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8814,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frank E.
