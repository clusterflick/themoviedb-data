The program argues that because of the island's key location - sandwiched, as it is, in-between Southern Europe and Northern Africa - it inevitably impeded Axis and Allied reinforcement deliveries time and again. As a result, the Maltese people found themselves caught in the middle of a crossfire when they had virtually nothing to do with the war itself, and suffered immensely for their geographic placement. In telling this seldom-heard story, the program draws on first-person interviews, CGI animations, and dramatic recreations.","popularity":0.3327,"poster_path":"/cbIkKUi0Omr42DwFt3boTW9oIHX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99605,"logo_path":null,"name":"Imaginites","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2007-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Against All Odds: The Quest For Malta","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1316302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Serge","original_name":"David Serge","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5a90619251413f710131cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1597972,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jean Pierre Magro","original_name":"Jean Pierre Magro","popularity":0.0484,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5a9077c3a36867f60119e0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0485748","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gLo1mrhgHojNrkdBpoN3SQqIYZv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.69,"height":787,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cbIkKUi0Omr42DwFt3boTW9oIHX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":543}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":9330,"name":"malta"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Against All Odds - The Quest for Malta","key":"JXS__98tszs","published_at":"2009-02-24T13:12:23.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5b1b4b3c9251414bd4017a9a"}]}}}
