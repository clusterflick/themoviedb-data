When Mabel is called to the church meeting with her mother, she sends Muggsy a note asking him to meet her after the service so he may walk home with her. Muggsy is there on time, however, the old ladies are afraid to make the return trip unaccompanied. The pastor asks that a man escort them home. Poor Muggsy gets chosen, and when the trio reach the deserted part of the road, the tramps again appear.","popularity":0.4753,"poster_path":"/jkLGj3GLLYGxZXD6dw1MYkzMeva.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1910-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Muggsy Becomes a Hero","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Quirk","original_name":"Billy Quirk","popularity":0.0975,"profile_path":"/mVRHKE8gPNB3b3BEKIZ1rAj0W4f.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Muggsy","credit_id":"5a11b6ddc3a3686280058705","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Pickford","original_name":"Mary Pickford","popularity":0.6455,"profile_path":"/y0FHoj9AjmVveKkdeFuqhuVYaTf.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mabel","credit_id":"5a11b6efc3a368628905187d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":145109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Bruce","original_name":"Kate Bruce","popularity":0.1372,"profile_path":"/oLC99DsB0gkPdsZJRi0d1D1B4hD.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"One of the Sisters Frost","credit_id":"62e876f71c09fb006001623a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire McDowell","original_name":"Claire McDowell","popularity":0.4763,"profile_path":"/lITEhC4pY2UiqmItzQMBnexxcMU.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"One of the Sisters Frost","credit_id":"62e87720fdf8b70061eb673a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Pickford","original_name":"Jack Pickford","popularity":0.1327,"profile_path":"/iSCajrPZY0pVD4gFrl1PsZyE2kr.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mabel's Brother","credit_id":"62e8772c293835005df9b125","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1044969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Dillon","original_name":"Edward Dillon","popularity":0.1626,"profile_path":"/lRWa2M2guVQUo4GCMPComWsds79.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"One of Muggsy's Friends","credit_id":"62e8770f1bf266005da40b41","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1091997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edwin August","original_name":"Edwin August","popularity":0.1212,"profile_path":"/cpnHZ8of3zIXpsGG6jsLl7dCZ8s.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"One of Muggsy's Friends","credit_id":"62e87758091e62005ae3fc9d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1016129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Henderson","original_name":"Grace Henderson","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":"/h9DRMmxkbujKEBV4wKyS7hF5nqm.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mabel's Mother","credit_id":"5a11b70692514138e7054dba","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred Paget","original_name":"Alfred Paget","popularity":0.2494,"profile_path":"/rGXy9gRwMRb6GhU8bQeReH56hsJ.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"A Tramp","credit_id":"62e8776b764b99005ee307ca","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99378,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dell Henderson","original_name":"Dell Henderson","popularity":0.2378,"profile_path":"/gA4BPbRHPSvI16n1QcRlAd3gmSo.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"A Tramp","credit_id":"62e877737caa470061e1071f","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1171452,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William J.
