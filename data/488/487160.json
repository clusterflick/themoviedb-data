Fun products scroll across the screen as a break. We switch lives. The young girl now watches. Actually she has always been watching, bemused. The obvious things go unnoticed but not by her.  The title THIS ROOM IS WHITE was mentioned in a conversation with a friend who used it as a new expression of speech, referring to the obvious, the fact, the reality which often gets ignored.  This movie was made with hand-drawn animation, 15 drawings per second and stop-motion with the \"Wacky Stickers\" (which is my collection for when I was a kid in the early 70's). Several scenes were rotoscoped from films from the 70's.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/llzjF59GSrU0TuHxsFyIsAOwOLH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Room Is White","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1600638,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karen Yasinsky","original_name":"Karen Yasinsky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/7gHbN3iCG9hVHCrXyDrDvHTuJ47.jpg","credit_id":"5a0b5d22c3a368218a0280f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.638,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/llzjF59GSrU0TuHxsFyIsAOwOLH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":957}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
