Shadi stands outside the gate and holds her mothers skirt as tight as she can. The mother caresses Shadis braided hair, and then tears her fingers apart from her daughter, and a man forces Shadi onto the plane. Shadi is eleven years old and all alone on her way to an unknown world. She ends up at an orphanage for unaccompanied children in Stockholm. But flashbacks from the war and nightmares make it hard for Shadi to tell the difference between reality and fantasy. The only thing she wants is to be with her mother again. And so one night she hears her mothers voice in the hall.","popularity":0.101,"poster_path":"/djJ5IpDyWPNoMUQwjkNTtPs4Jua.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IQ","name":"Iraq"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2014-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shadi","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Shadi","type":"International title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1924260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beri Aydin","original_name":"Beri Aydin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Shadi","credit_id":"5a0c6ba2c3a36876420132bb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":92416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandra Rapaport","original_name":"Alexandra Rapaport","popularity":0.9087,"profile_path":"/s1YiDSnSdXbX4HhbMC8588kWY15.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Alexandra","credit_id":"5a0c6bb9c3a36875fa012871","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1899151,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siham Shurafa","original_name":"Siham Shurafa","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":"/crRdQgNDbj8XPBVu7VkG6su0Uz1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Leila","credit_id":"5a0c6bca9251414df3013540","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1500741,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Zanyar Adami","original_name":"Zanyar Adami","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a0c6be79251414d99013f3b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1500741,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Zanyar Adami","original_name":"Zanyar Adami","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a0c6bde9251414d99013f24","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3058120","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/djJ5IpDyWPNoMUQwjkNTtPs4Jua.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
