A socially engaged documentarian, Wildenhahn is also perplexed by this issue and spends considerable time trying to place Bausch in a context outside of the aesthetic. Still, the dance company's daily life and the excruciating rehearsal and performance schedule is solidly captured. The film begins cleverly: a dance critic offers sagacious comments on ballet dancers finishing their careers at mid-thirty just when, according to Bausch, the \"aspects of misery, suffering and fear of death should become an integral part of a dancer's spiritual and psychological make-up.\" Wildenhahn's camera glides over the dancers' bodies as Bausch leads them through their paces, a consummate teacher. Leaving behind rehearsals of \"Bandoneón\" and \"Walzer,\" Wildenhahn then ventures out into the streets of Wuppertal searching for the dance of the common people.","popularity":0.1289,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7201,"logo_path":"/ljV8ZT3CIYCEIEDlTyBliXJVCZr.png","name":"NDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1983-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What Are Pina Bausch and Her Dancers Doing in Wuppertal?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pina Bausch","original_name":"Pina Bausch","popularity":0.1556,"profile_path":"/dJUPRQzvViez5k379xjEzDtQOUg.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5a0dff89c3a36862800005c6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46479,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klaus Wildenhahn","original_name":"Klaus Wildenhahn","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a0dff9792514138ea0005a0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46479,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klaus Wildenhahn","original_name":"Klaus Wildenhahn","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a0dff9fc3a36862800005e6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1488258,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christhart Burgmann","original_name":"Christhart Burgmann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a0dffa892514138f3000534","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1924820,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rainer Hagen","original_name":"Rainer Hagen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a0dffb392514138f90004f1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1738130,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Wolfgang Jost","original_name":"Wolfgang Jost","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a0dffbc92514138f600056b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1736869,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Petra Arciszewski","original_name":"Petra Arciszewski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a0dffc7c3a3686283000647","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0289614","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Toronto Film Festival","release_date":"1983-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"Berlin International Film Festival","release_date":"1983-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
