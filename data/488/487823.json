Pollution blocks our conversations with the stars. Poet Abid Haider is a lover of nature and he is deeply hurt by this catastrophe. His ideal is an unpolluted atmosphere. He yearns to revel in the sight of night skies twinkling with stars. It is his birthright, also the birthright of the generations to come. This is what he believes. Firm in this belief, he refuses to give up his claim to Earth even after death. Because the poet thinks that the human footprint upon Earth, the fruit of all our efforts is deathless, flowing perennially. Death might terminate one branch of thought but it cannot obliterate human endeavor. The enterprise that is life continues.","popularity":0.1234,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Death of a Poet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":567726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jayanto Chattopadhyay","original_name":"Jayanto Chattopadhyay","popularity":0.0861,"profile_path":"/1YLSDO84dJazHEHpMyT6FclWqt1.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Abid Haider","credit_id":"5a108b57c3a36862920316d0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1925867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Airin Sultana","original_name":"Airin Sultana","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Mrittu","credit_id":"5a108b74c3a36862800387a2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":998670,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abu Sayeed","original_name":"Abu Sayeed","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a108ba692514138f6034b2a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":998670,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abu Sayeed","original_name":"Abu Sayeed","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a108bde92514138ea035329","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":998670,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abu Sayeed","original_name":"Abu Sayeed","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a108bb492514138f30364dd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":998670,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abu Sayeed","original_name":"Abu Sayeed","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a108bc4c3a36862830367bf","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":998670,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abu Sayeed","original_name":"Abu Sayeed","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a108b97c3a36862800387f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7063068","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"abu.sayeed07","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BD","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
