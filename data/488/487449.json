The first is a love story about a truck driver who, on his way from Johannesburg (South Africa) to Luderitz (Namibia), is haunted by thoughts of his girlfriend and their recently severed relationship. His memories are expressed in an often recurring scene, in which songs by Alec Empire, Macy Gray and Robert Schumann roughly tell the story. This small history is alternated with the tragic fate of the Namibian Heroro people, many thousands of whom died early last century in concentration camps that had been set up by the German colonisers near Luderitz. The depiction of this history is cruder and more poignant, with slanting frames, odd camera angles and a multi-layered sound sculpture. The dilapidated barracks and officers' quarters are the last remnants of the miscarried, so-called civilisation projects in Africa.","popularity":0.1075,"poster_path":"/z8eBsURD4otqUV7z2NveRe8jKOo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90188,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mandala Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2001-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Western 4.33","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1924775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boy Thomas Shipanga","original_name":"Boy Thomas Shipanga","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5a0dd89f9251416c89000c9c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1924776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Minnie Mandala","original_name":"Minnie Mandala","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5a0dd8a69251416c8c000ce1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1142409,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aryan Kaganof","original_name":"Aryan Kaganof","popularity":0.0484,"profile_path":"/rUElkeHdGyUXje2Sl0ubwWNRKOj.jpg","credit_id":"5a0dd8bac3a36804ad000d1d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1142409,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aryan Kaganof","original_name":"Aryan Kaganof","popularity":0.0484,"profile_path":"/rUElkeHdGyUXje2Sl0ubwWNRKOj.jpg","credit_id":"5a0dd8cd9251416c85000d59","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1058861,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Wiro Felix","original_name":"Wiro Felix","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/oBD8rcZ4U8x806VbxaMbm8hDhzg.jpg","credit_id":"5a0dd8c29251416c7d000cbc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1058861,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Wiro Felix","original_name":"Wiro Felix","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/oBD8rcZ4U8x806VbxaMbm8hDhzg.jpg","credit_id":"5a0dd8dcc3a36804b8000d4c","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1924778,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"C.R.
