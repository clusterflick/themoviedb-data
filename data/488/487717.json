In 2003 filmmaker Tigre Hill chronicled the Philadelphia mayoral race between Democrat incumbent mayor, John Street and Republican challenger Sam Katz. Early polls showed Katz with a small lead. Hill had inside access to the Katz campaign and although rebuffed by the Street campaign, managed to get footage. Twenty-seven days before the election an FBI bug was found in the mayor s office. It looked like 1904 all over again-blatant corruption. The discovery of the bug at first seemed like a death knell to the Street campaign and a near certain victory for Katz. How did the mayor react to the bug? This powerful documentary shows how-drum up support by polarizing the electorate.","popularity":0.7942,"poster_path":"/lBNvTnKUQzjMqcZnGqz69d6wyRJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Shame of a City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Clinton","original_name":"Bill Clinton","popularity":0.5146,"profile_path":"/aOSAwUHkTYdcVrl5MdOzuGRluTm.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a1073f1c3a36862890312a5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Cosby","original_name":"Bill Cosby","popularity":0.9078,"profile_path":"/oN2wqTSYNrMliATEijuBYV4vi9z.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a107402c3a368627d0370b9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Carville","original_name":"James Carville","popularity":0.3358,"profile_path":"/9nqZlgTmykti5veQEFljHAr6NaL.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a10741092514138f9030a31","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolph Giuliani","original_name":"Rudolph Giuliani","popularity":0.2991,"profile_path":"/jcDZkl6E5nhpNCqdi7PwqWiCiBy.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a10741c92514138f0032cfc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1925821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John F.
