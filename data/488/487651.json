Even the minister, who performed their marriage ceremony, making a pastoral call annoys him. They attend a social gathering, and his ill-concealed perturbation at his young wife's affability with all present spoils her evening's pleasure, and finally induces her to ask to be taken home. Arriving home, a stormy scene ensues, and there might have been a separation but for the wife's subtleness in placing within his range delicate reminders of her own gentleness.","popularity":0.4943,"poster_path":"/kuPnbACtSISmKUuITEbU8Z5b5EB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1910-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Victim of Jealousy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":296085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Kirkwood","original_name":"James Kirkwood","popularity":0.279,"profile_path":"/svL7O0IG1wHWXr9BUIolCWkKeeN.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"The Husband","credit_id":"5a0f467192514138e7019cb0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1174211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Barker","original_name":"Florence Barker","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":"/9UBRj7K9xRDyGkNvGxE8Jdwv22S.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Wife","credit_id":"5a0f4691c3a3686292017547","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Pickford","original_name":"Mary Pickford","popularity":0.6455,"profile_path":"/y0FHoj9AjmVveKkdeFuqhuVYaTf.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Wife's Friend","credit_id":"5a0f46a5c3a368628c01633f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89518,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mack Sennett","original_name":"Mack Sennett","popularity":0.2719,"profile_path":"/24XTSL0AbuT6gzjqAFhpc4fkEts.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Milliner","credit_id":"629d1e5e7d5db50869944495","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1268226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Hart","original_name":"Ruth Hart","popularity":0.1021,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Maid","credit_id":"629d1e747ad08c6ee1a949b5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1362381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Verner Clarges","original_name":"Verner Clarges","popularity":0.0927,"profile_path":"/uQ4vVt4fT8gAjp60AIrdBuYdEZw.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Minister","credit_id":"629d1e98d71fb474ded46633","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100036,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"D.W.
