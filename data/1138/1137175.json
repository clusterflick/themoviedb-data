By mechanising the means of expression Berlewi sought to arrive at the effect of texture variation without departing from the inherent two-dimensionality of painting. The movement generated by adding rhythm to the image was described by Berlewi as if he was describing a film, which prompted Marcin Giżycki to create this moving image reconstruction.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/wcv4sRJOTVwa7KNqZauwmHPiB9k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Three animated variations on Henryk Berlewi’s ‘Mechanofaktura.
