Cano's quest in the Patagonian region is set in an imaginary landscape dotted with the remains of an oil drilling activity from a by-gone age. The camera pans across huge expansive vistas, mountain landscapes and dry gullies but the presence of polluted drilling rigs rapidly transforms the scene into an infected idyll that sums up our contemporary contradictory world in a dialectically polarized image. Like the jogging metaphor, Diaz Morales' images are constantly on the run - in a single image but also in the diachronic time span of the film. The result is a richly coded and fractal filmic progression that, like the jogging metaphor, is constantly moving on the spot or moving from point to point. This, like other of his films, is continuously passing from a concrete geographical or socio cultural context to a fictitious elsewhere.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/yD5V267OHp5ZkJ6yuunLsO01IWs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parallel 46˚","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4101192,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gustavo Cano","original_name":"Gustavo Cano","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"El Cano","credit_id":"64807b60e375c000ff468a25","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4101193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricardo Amado","original_name":"Ricardo Amado","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The Man with the Cross","credit_id":"64807b7899259c00c5b2ab18","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2365185,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gastón Ergas","original_name":"Gastón Ergas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Recycled Man","credit_id":"64807ba3bf31f200aec64e1d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4101197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillermo Pablo Díaz","original_name":"Guillermo Pablo Díaz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"The Supreme","credit_id":"64807bc0bf31f200c612a3ab","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4101198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolas Stupenengo","original_name":"Nicolas Stupenengo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Methaphor","credit_id":"64807bd6bf31f200c612a3be","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1159061,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"María Florencia Álvarez","original_name":"María Florencia Álvarez","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Girl on the beach","credit_id":"64807bebe2726000e8bea704","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1747281,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sebastián Diaz Morales","original_name":"Sebastián Diaz Morales","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64807b2dd2b209010c17190a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/yD5V267OHp5ZkJ6yuunLsO01IWs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
