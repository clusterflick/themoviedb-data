The young baker, overwhelmed with work, has among his clients several unemployed people, who he takes time to listen to and advise. He looks for the right words to encourage the most resigned, and calm those who, at their wits’ end, use him to vent their anger. The film sometimes follows the efforts of the unemployed with the administration, sometimes their clash with the functionaries, who ask them to prove their family composition.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unemployed, not a dog!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
