Today, Jews worldwide – and even non-Jews – revere him as the founder of the Hasidic movement, a 18th-century offshoot of Judaism that promotes a mystical interpretation of the Bible, and as a model of piety and spirituality. The documentary A FIRE IN THE FOREST explores the life and legacy of the Ba'al Shem Tov through interviews with religious leaders and scholars, and on-location footage. The title derives from a tale about rabbis finding a hidden fire in the forest where they could appeal to God for help and have their prayers answered.","popularity":1.0012,"poster_path":"/pQVJASTmx1CNrM7IPeU4z4oVIdi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":195326,"logo_path":null,"name":"Throughline Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Fire in the Forest: The Life and Legacy of the Ba'al Shem Tov","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4103394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Soloway","original_name":"Marc Soloway","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self - Host / Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"64825626d2b20900ebbf46f0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4103392,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Antony Cooper","original_name":"Antony Cooper","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648255b4e375c000acc42eb6","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4103376,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Netanel Miles-Yépez","original_name":"Netanel Miles-Yépez","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648254cbe375c000acc42e6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2735505,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Charles W.
