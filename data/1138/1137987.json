In anger, the Earth God unleashed a great disaster, collapsing the skies and shattering the earth. From the darkness, sealed demons rose and ravaged the mortal realm. Amid the chaos, Wu Jian Dao Ren of the Divine Sword Sect stood as humanity’s last hope, wielding the legendary Divine Sword of Annihilation—crafted from celestial black iron and capable of destroying demons. Yet, its power came with a curse: death to its wielder. To protect the secret, the sword and its technique, \"Heavenly Ascension,\" were hidden separately. Years later, three childhood friends—Xiao Cuo, Xiao Ni, and Xiao Yun—are raised by rival realms: Dao, Demon, and Immortal. As they grow into Wu Jian, Mo Ni, and Sheng Nü, one fateful night changes everything. The fate of the world now lies in their hands—will they choose light or darkness?","popularity":0.1999,"poster_path":"/d2D9Y8xEOv7ZHSlKBtDVDjym16e.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Infernal Fighter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130598,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Fan Siu-Wong","original_name":"Louis Fan Siu-Wong","popularity":0.7554,"profile_path":"/jBuu1y50Qeq27tJyikx6KHGcyJE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6482ce87c9dbf900e3fec313","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Cheng Ho-Nam","original_name":"鄭浩南","popularity":0.8004,"profile_path":"/k8lmHBNt34iqrGKgsPHrUYvUP3y.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6482ce8de375c000acc47d29","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":83689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Ng Wing-Mei","original_name":"伍詠薇","popularity":0.7705,"profile_path":"/bzaqtrL7p92iyUXckEl8JEYsBpO.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6482ceade272600147b9071b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":548052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lily Chung Suk-Wai","original_name":"鐘淑慧","popularity":0.877,"profile_path":"/aXq9i924gUsurXwvltMbr5Wr0E4.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6482cf3de375c000c526b760","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2538508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sze Hung-Bor","original_name":"史洪波","popularity":0.101,"profile_path":"/uPKCUzxlaRpi7ZWbCVDGuYXqP8P.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67d872fb12c967e22cf1561b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1600349,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alan Lo Shun-Chuen","original_name":"Alan Lo Shun-Chuen","popularity":0.1028,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6482ce5d99259c011c3f62fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.66,"height":1463,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d2D9Y8xEOv7ZHSlKBtDVDjym16e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":966}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
