Denim Sky is a feature film in three parts.  Together the trilogy is a playful exploration of non-nuclear family and community structures, the theoretical effects of non-linear time travel on human relationships, and how this could aid or problematise communication. The narrative is based on a fiction about a spaceship crew brought together in order to develop a crew mentality, so that they can be used to test a new form of space travel that uses non-linear time. Throughout, the light humour and fraternal mood of the group are disrupted by unsettling and unexpected events.","popularity":0.0306,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Denim Sky","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rosalind Nashashibi","original_name":"Rosalind Nashashibi","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/73XYrrsLlb0lGXcVH7fTjfbVDdR.jpg","credit_id":"6481d847647654014333de85","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: https://opencitylondon.com/news/denim-sky/","release_date":"2022-12-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
