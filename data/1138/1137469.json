A Video Seance","overview":"Vanished! A Video Seance is a true story. In 1932 elderly parents and their young daughter came to live in isolation on a windswept hill on the west coast of the Isle of Man. Gef, an entity or familiar or presence, attached itself to the family for six years. It proclaimed its identity in a number of ways, one being, \"I am the ghost of a mongoose with tiny yellow hands\". The notoriety and investigations of the event are now all but forgotten, the house where they lived erased. Only fragments and shadows can be summoned to bear witness to that which has vanished.","popularity":0.5137,"poster_path":"/3BzjZPJA3qQeGqxR4KN7bP5cNAS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arts Council of England","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":201713,"logo_path":null,"name":"South London Gallery","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1999-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vanished!
