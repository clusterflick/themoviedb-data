Idiosyncratic by nature, and textually lo-fi by necessity, this unique mojo long served as the label’s de facto sonic aesthetic. A protégé of Prince Buster, and a former engineer at Duke Reid’s Treasure Isle label, Barnes’ touch can be felt across dozens of records including sides from Wayne Jarrett, Sugar Minott, Prince Douglas, Horace Andy, Love Joys, and fellow producer, Lee ‘Scratch’ Perry.  Released in 1981, the following hour-long documentary, Bullwackie In New York, provides a priceless snapshot of the independent label and the culture surrounding it. Live performances, interviews, studio footage and more.","popularity":0.3255,"poster_path":"/aw8uifSryEynR7GbtMtVHZEM2NF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1985-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bullwackie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Bullwackie in New York","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4101303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lloyd Barnes","original_name":"Lloyd Barnes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self “Bullwackie”","credit_id":"6480921fd2b20900ebbe9531","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2558734,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Horace Andy","original_name":"Horace Andy","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6480926dbf31f2011d4167ef","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1125069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sugar Minott","original_name":"Sugar Minott","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"648092f099259c00c5b2b4b6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4101311,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wayne Jarrett","original_name":"Wayne Jarrett","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64809383bf31f200e3fb2bd5","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1467355,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nic Morris","original_name":"Nic Morris","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648094b199259c00ff0c75a6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3529042,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christopher Coy","original_name":"Christopher Coy","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64809452e375c000e24d5da3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4248824","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.722,"height":1552,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aw8uifSryEynR7GbtMtVHZEM2NF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1121}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4307,"name":"reggae"},{"id":178959,"name":"reggae music"},{"id":318915,"name":"bullwackie"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1985-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bullwackie In New York 1981 ⬥Wackies Rhythm Force⬥","key":"_mkhhAQ0z5g","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-06-18T13:55:19.000Z","id":"6480964e64765400e67fd36f"}]}}}
