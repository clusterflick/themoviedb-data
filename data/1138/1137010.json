With football legend, turned actor, Jim Brown (J'amore Ward) attached to the picture, it seems the sky's the limit for these two filmmakers. Desperate to finally receive the recognition he's longed for, Gordon struggles to find the balance between passion and stardom. However, when Gordon pushes the MPAA rating guidelines of traditional cinema, he finds himself in a rabbit hole he's unsure he can escape from when his movie receives the first ever R-rating.","popularity":0.5112,"poster_path":"/zStGa4UxALdQ21Kr234VVL8fbXa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":223885,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moe's House
