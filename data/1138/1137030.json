Most have no hope of recovery, even their families have given up on them. All day long they observe as the world goes by, or they simply turn inwards. And yet hope still burns within them: from time to time they gather strength and clench their fists, or even stand up again. Instead of a simple report, director Pál Zolnay and cinematographer Elemér Ragályi recompose images of despair, illness and death, inner fortitude, playfulness and hope into lyrical film poetry.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rise and Walk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1298254,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pál Zolnay","original_name":"Pál Zolnay","popularity":0.067,"profile_path":"/r9TJFImV6LF9ASrwowZNlfqZpvf.jpg","credit_id":"647faeb4ca7ec6011cb45ad2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hu","note":"","release_date":"1969-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
