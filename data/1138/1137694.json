The film perversely plays with the processes and mechanisms through which cinematic meaning is produced. Kwiek divided it into two parts. In the first, the screen is completely dark as the artist describes the process of making the film. The second part is a silent projection of the film that Kwiek described in the first part. Within this structure, Kwiek collides visualisations of two kinds. Mental images of a given situation, created in our minds and based on Kwiek’s story from the first part of the movie, collide with the actual images of the situation, recorded on a film and perceived by the viewer in the second part.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ja i telefon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1621600,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paweł Kwiek","original_name":"Paweł Kwiek","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6481d94be272600147b88d31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
