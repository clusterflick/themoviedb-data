A journey that is also a father's birthday gift to a son who becomes a man.  Soleri is one of the most important characters of the twentieth century, still forgotten, and his life is told with the virgin eyes of an aspiring architect with very open antennas about what is happening in the world and what each of us can do to help improve it.","popularity":0.0445,"poster_path":"/3di3rStiyCj3rZcDwVY4CsmuPHB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84319,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sonne-Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2023-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How does one live in a utopia?","title":"Ask The Sand","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2290210,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vittorio Bongiorno","original_name":"Vittorio Bongiorno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64806facbf31f200aec6489a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2290210,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vittorio Bongiorno","original_name":"Vittorio Bongiorno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64806fc1e2726000c92e985a","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4101084,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nicola Cavalazzi","original_name":"Nicola Cavalazzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64806fd1e2726000e8bea148","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2192345,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Angelica Gentilini","original_name":"Angelica Gentilini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64806fe4e27260012877e44a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1068,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vq3OMsMqn3vmgCTV1evwA7OTfae.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1899}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1754,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3di3rStiyCj3rZcDwVY4CsmuPHB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1240}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
