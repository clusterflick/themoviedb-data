Alongside a chorus of the citizens of Catania and the stories of real abuse survivors, Devoti Tutti shows how a community’s reverence for its saint masks misogynist realities. In her cell Agatha is kept company by her breasts, which her tormenters severed from her body—a reminder of the violence she suffered, but also of her refusal to submit to a man’s desire. Together with the flying breasts, Agatha escapes from the chamber where she has been held prisoner for two millennia and flies out over the ocean and into her own self-creation.","popularity":0.0407,"poster_path":"/rsRPSLM6ck3v6avD5dJHC6tMUKH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A transcendent story about women who struggle to escape the trauma of sexual violence.","title":"Devoti tutti","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donatella Finocchiaro","original_name":"Donatella Finocchiaro","popularity":0.1272,"profile_path":"/zAcHyOB6O3vN0hKs8PwxOyw2Ngd.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Agatha","credit_id":"64806cac99259c00c5b2a4a8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1102084,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernadette Wegenstein","original_name":"Bernadette Wegenstein","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64806c0499259c00c5b2a44a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1102084,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernadette Wegenstein","original_name":"Bernadette Wegenstein","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64806c2c99259c00c5b2a471","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1102084,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernadette Wegenstein","original_name":"Bernadette Wegenstein","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64806c52bf31f2011d415878","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4101063,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Adriana Copete","original_name":"Adriana Copete","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64806cc6e27260012877e2fb","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Lead Animator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2825887,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Stefan Fauland","original_name":"Stefan Fauland","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64806ce7bf31f2011d4158aa","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1991504,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edoardo Morabito","original_name":"Edoardo Morabito","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64806cf3d2b209010c17130b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jUXRRmsoJipP3EzzuSJABdkU3uH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rsRPSLM6ck3v6avD5dJHC6tMUKH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1013}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
