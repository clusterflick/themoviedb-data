Documentary filmmaker Patricio Gonz치lez Colville searches for the ancestral rites that characterize the relationship between God and man from the countryside. A strange mix of faith, devotion, pagan festival, wine, submission, violence and sorcery make up these rites whose origin has been forgotten but tradition does not allow losing. Cultural mixes over time have given rise to the peculiar current peasant religion. The documentalist's camera allows the country man to express his personal experiences, beliefs and divergences with divinity in his simple language. Through five chapters, the documentary searches the Maule Region for the descendants of Adam, expelled from Paradise to cultivate the land. What kind of faith does this man have left and how does he manifest it? The documentary presents his perspective on this controversial issue.","popularity":0.2517,"poster_path":"/tcK0wynHUzPNPBuNcibl3KqK8gU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa침ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Penitentes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4100566,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patricio Gonz치lez Colville","original_name":"Patricio Gonz치lez Colville","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647fdfb26476540124961aff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":894,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tcK0wynHUzPNPBuNcibl3KqK8gU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3684,"name":"religion and supernatural"},{"id":6460,"name":"chile"},{"id":192947,"name":"religious film"},{"id":296082,"name":"campo"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
