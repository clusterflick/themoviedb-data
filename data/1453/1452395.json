It is a montage of images from the Vorticist magazine Blast, including Vorticist drawings and texts from the manifestos. A screen made from a collage of photographic enlargements from the magazine was prepared for the screening of this film. The soundtrack evokes the sounds of World War I, which were, in a way, the climax of the Vorticist movement in England. During the Expanded Cinema presentations, excerpts from Blast were read during the film screening.
