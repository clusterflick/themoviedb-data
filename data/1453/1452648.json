Not just a music documentary, it's a snapshot of the city's vibrant independent music scene at its most intimate. Captured in a house that has long functioned as a hub for creativity in the city, it follows a cast of musicians and artists as they record a document of their own time. Bands fill every room in the house, from the bathroom to the attic. On-the-fly, direct and genuinely urgent, 6015 Willow follows twenty Halifax bands over three days, sweating buckets and blowing fuses.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/qsK5Dm8I5EGCeUb7ESMfquo8Jz9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"20 bands. 3 days. 1 house.","title":"6015 Willow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5321958,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Mullane","original_name":"Mark Mullane","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67e34e6c16a3c5c224f08e16","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5321958,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Mullane","original_name":"Mark Mullane","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67df1af5c0b4387a6ec6fb6c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5328251,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Hammond","original_name":"Paul Hammond","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e34e3fd4052f4793dc8e4e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5328252,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeffrey Parker","original_name":"Jeffrey Parker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e34e51e28af41cfc7621ec","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2200959","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4PwcUdBVRkAhXHdBkEZPHJgmTEx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1281}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qsK5Dm8I5EGCeUb7ESMfquo8Jz9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
