SMART GUY IS FRESH, SASSY, BOLD AND CONFIDENT\"  Actor LES BROWN has been seen in small parts in \"NORMAL LIFE\" with Luke Perry and in an episode of \"EARLY EDITION\" with Kyle Chandler also in a SAG commercial for H.I.S. Jeans. In all of those and now here in MR. SMART GUY, Les Brown is getting to be a better and better actor as time and every scene goes by. Why, you can tell he's not too good at the beginning of this movie, and by the end of this production, he'll seem as if he's learned a thing or two about acting on-camera as well as producing and directing since he does all of that in MR. SMART GUY.  He plays MARXY a monster who wonâ€™t be threatened; and his friends will stand behind him.
