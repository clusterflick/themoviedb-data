One continuous physical rotation at the rate of 8fps motion equals one second of time and yields 8 separate film frames. Stop motion is then applied, such that the figure does not spin but rather is repositioned across eight, then four, and finally two poses. Upon projection, the film reconstitutes the impression of a continuous action, while the multiple simultaneous perspectives evoke Cubism.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spinning","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1692051,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vicky Smith","original_name":"Vicky Smith","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67dedf48adf21a1668f59197","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1692051,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vicky Smith","original_name":"Vicky Smith","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dedf79338e77783ff5a67e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"iMAL, Brussels","release_date":"2023-12-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
