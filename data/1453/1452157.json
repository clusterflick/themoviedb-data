At the age of 60, only discovering Europe, the latter has had strange experiences there, but she does not give up the idea of visiting the Netherlands to be close to her son. Knar chooses humor and comedy to overcome these strange, lonely and painful experiences. She shares these experiences with the director, who unwittingly becomes the second hero of the film, as she is Knarâ€™s granddaughter, conversation partner and coffee buddy. For Knar, life is different in Armenia and outside Armenia, so the horizontal and vertical realities that combine together in the film will tell the story of opposing worlds, and a woman between them. What will happen and how will this cycle end, or will it end?","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/yAzcjzMmSiMVLEcHOj1F13uje92.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Armenian","iso_639_1":"hy","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"According to Armenian time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5319906,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diana Hovhannisyan","original_name":"Diana Hovhannisyan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ddce71338e77783ff56ffc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5319906,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diana Hovhannisyan","original_name":"Diana Hovhannisyan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ddce7d0416875adc6997c4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5319906,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diana Hovhannisyan","original_name":"Diana Hovhannisyan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ddce89c70acdd9df69a46b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yAzcjzMmSiMVLEcHOj1F13uje92.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hy","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
