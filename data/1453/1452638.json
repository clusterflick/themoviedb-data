He began working with printmaking when he moved to London around 1960. The film showcases his drypoint etching technique, then moves on to printing with a multicolor plate. Lloyd discusses the endless possibilities of plate engraving and then shows how he develops a color philosophy for each plate during the grading and printing process. The film ends with an overview of his prints as he discusses the ideas behind his work, many of which come from the Australian landscape. The film takes us from these images to a final sequence of animated printed details interspersed with a composition of electronic, musical, and natural sounds. The film is essentially a documentary, but we felt the need to include a more experimental coda that would free us from the confines of documentary.
