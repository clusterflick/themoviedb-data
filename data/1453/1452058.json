Directors Matthew O'Neill and Perri Peltz take viewers inside the high-stakes legal battle to hold tech companies accountable for the harm caused by their negligence and dangerous algorithms. Based on investigative reporting by Bloomberg News' Olivia Carville, the film follows the Social Media Victims Law Center fighting for justice for families whose children suffered tragic consequences linked to social media use. As families seek justice, 'Can't Look Away: The Case Against Social Media' underscores the urgent need for industry reform and serves as both a wake-up call about the dangers of social media-and a call to action to protect future generations.","popularity":0.1383,"poster_path":"/cMuDpReS2EtGW7RZRDzNI76SgIO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162546,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bloomberg
