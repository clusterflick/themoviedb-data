In Somalia, I have met children like Nasri, young people living on the edge of life, silently watching how their peers are treated.  Many children have created their own lives because they do not have a father and the freedom to do what they want. This film explores the possibility of a child who has already been abused in life. I hope this film gives a voice to the oppressed children of Somalia.  Somali filmmaking is finally starting to flourish after decades of prohibition and neglect. Somalia is full of talent, but there is little opportunity to showcase it. We made this film with a 100% Somali cast and crew. Many of the cast members (including Ahmed who played Nasri, and Adar who played Hawa) are first-time actors.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":6000,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hopeless","title":"Hopeless","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
