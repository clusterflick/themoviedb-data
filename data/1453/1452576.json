Hardly has he finished when the painting, nothing but that of a jumping-jack, begins to move its arms and legs and afterwards springs out of the frame. There follows between the three an irresistibly comic scene during which a number of amusing incidents take place, producing bursts of laughter from the audience.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":45867,"logo_path":null,"name":"Star Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1905-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A lost film","title":"Mr. Dauber and the Whimsical Picture","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Méliès","original_name":"Georges Méliès","popularity":0.2169,"profile_path":"/acx5saf22Qj6FV5WAsacRHlZAMn.jpg","credit_id":"67def4b5b8e0fea93407aba6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0228706","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1905-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
