Filmmaker Wayne Williams, who was 17 at the time, cuts back and forth between a chess game and a guerrilla theater war game to underscore the sense of importance of the fighters and the cynicism of those who control their lives - and deaths. The film is part of a series of student films that all won awards at the 1971 Young Chicago Filmmakerâ€™s Festival.","popularity":0.1455,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":257229,"logo_path":null,"name":"South Shore High School","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Game","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5322499,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wayne Williams","original_name":"Wayne Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67df8d4135bd26a7d94d840a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5322500,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Steve Boykin","original_name":"Steve Boykin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67df8d8cc2d819df69c70fc6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5322501,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bernard Jones","original_name":"Bernard Jones","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67df8db4b8e0fea93407cd18","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5322502,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ken Tucker","original_name":"Ken Tucker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67df8dc335bd26a7d94d8487","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5322503,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ron Tyler","original_name":"Ron Tyler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67df8dd1c2d819df69c70ffd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5322499,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wayne Williams","original_name":"Wayne Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67df8dfa4ce07d684e07c007","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5322500,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Steve Boykin","original_name":"Steve Boykin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67df8e08978bda8ae24d8c6f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5322502,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ken Tucker","original_name":"Ken Tucker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67df8e16c2d819df69c71044","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5322499,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wayne Williams","original_name":"Wayne Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67df8e2a4ce07d684e07c00e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5322499,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wayne Williams","original_name":"Wayne Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67df8e444ce07d684e07c021","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":280617,"name":"student film"},{"id":293423,"name":"amateur"},{"id":311322,"name":"anti-war"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
