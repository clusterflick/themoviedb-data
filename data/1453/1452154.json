Depicted through anthropomorphic animals, we see a unique alternative perspective. Judas (an unscrupulous black goat) has been at odds with Jesus (a self-crucifying white sheep) ever since childhood.

But what will Jesus' adoring fans have to say about it?","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/bnuQpUnmo2rvjLGYehcf9qnaGKE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2009-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A biblical rivaly unilke you've ever seen before!","title":"Judas & Jesus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bnuQpUnmo2rvjLGYehcf9qnaGKE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"Shown at the 2009 Annecy International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2009-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
