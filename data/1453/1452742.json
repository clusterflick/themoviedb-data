The house seems very comforting and the family appear to be nice as well, which makes them want to stay longer than expected. Their decision to stay is not favored anymore when they find out that the family does rituals and the house is evil spirited… they learn that the family’s true intentions for them are to be sacrificed. With the family trying to hunt them down at every corner, they try their best to survive and find an escape.","popularity":0.2397,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":257010,"logo_path":null,"name":"Josiah productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2026-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"Which House Are You In?","title":"Wrong House","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5318276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josiah Eni","original_name":"Josiah Eni","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Drew Williams","credit_id":"67df514a210fa80a0f4d86f6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5324546,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lilly Allen","original_name":"Lilly Allen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Tiff May","credit_id":"67e0e684968ee208674d7801","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5318276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josiah Eni","original_name":"Josiah Eni","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67df5176c0b4387a6ec70647","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5318276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josiah Eni","original_name":"Josiah Eni","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67df5188c0b4387a6ec70653","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5318276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josiah Eni","original_name":"Josiah Eni","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67df7232b8e0fea93407c947","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1533,"name":"isolation"},{"id":1442,"name":"winter"},{"id":3358,"name":"haunted house"},{"id":10349,"name":"survival"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"R","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2026-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
