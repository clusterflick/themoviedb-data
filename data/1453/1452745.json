Produced specifically for a junior audience, this Uzbek film advocates the wonders of urban living with its bounteous nursery schools and technological advancements, and has a clear ideological message for the new Soviet youth.  Ideology aside, this is a thoroughly delightful film thanks to its endearing young stars and its playful use of animation.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":228147,"logo_path":null,"name":"Uzbek-Goskino","origin_country":"UZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UZ","name":"Uzbekistan"},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1935-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Klych","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1867073,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuldash Agzamov","original_name":"Yuldash Agzamov","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67df514ab8e0fea93407c313","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5234838,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aleksandr Sharapov","original_name":"Александр Шарапов","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67df515a210fa80a0f4d8702","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1935-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
