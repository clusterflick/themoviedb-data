Kelvin makes a run for it only to find himself fenced by Marcus' web of deception. Fuelled with anger, Marcus and his sidekick, Keith (Huggy Lever) subject Kelvin to a no-mercy treatment. Will the dice reveal Kelvin's destiny or do the tarot cards hold the key to his fate? What if everyday you were given the chance to make the same decision? What if everyone you ever trusted seemed distrustful? Deceptively layered and intriguingly misleading, Somnolence is a gripping tale of a man who finds himself confronted with the inevitable and eternal truth: salvation.","popularity":0.2816,"poster_path":"/9e9lJhCBqeMkHZ71Q6Qr3wl75WH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Somnolence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":79863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kiki Kendrick","original_name":"Kiki Kendrick","popularity":0.1227,"profile_path":"/yDY1J1FfJpMp0Y3U2MugsUVtsZh.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tina Tarrot","credit_id":"67def922c2d819df69c6f69c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4535097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Cocking","original_name":"Sam Cocking","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67def93330e65e7beec6f523","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5104702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Driscoll","original_name":"Amanda Driscoll","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67def971c2d819df69c6f6d7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5321697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Dimarco","original_name":"Steve Dimarco","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67def984c2d819df69c6f6ef","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5321691,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ali Sade","original_name":"Ali Sade","popularity":0.0907,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67def906b8e0fea93407ad59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1347288","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9e9lJhCBqeMkHZ71Q6Qr3wl75WH.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
