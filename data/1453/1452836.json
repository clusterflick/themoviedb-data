As a chaste druid priestess, she decides on war and peace in an occupied land; secretly, she’s the lover of Roman commander Pollione and mother of his two children. Her double life unravels when Pollione plans to leave her for the younger priestess Adalgisa. Caught between love and vengeance, faith and reason, tradition and empire, Norma nearly kills her children—before choosing another, equally radical path. Vincenzo Bellini’s 1831 opera is a masterpiece of Italian Romanticism. The role of Norma, with its emotional and vocal range from bel canto to raw outcry, is iconic. Director Vasily Barkhatov sets the tragedy amid political upheaval, where old idols are replaced by new. Star soprano Asmik Grigorian debuts in the title role. Adalgisa is sung by Aigul Akhmetshina.","popularity":0.1103,"poster_path":"/2c8plWX4qzfQvxORiCz1WEMS8d6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":238509,"logo_path":null,"name":"Musiktheater an der Wien","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2025-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":185,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Musiktheater an der Wien","title":"Norma","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1344438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asmik Grigorian","original_name":"Asmik Grigorian","popularity":0.1141,"profile_path":"/1OSKsFOKC3cUq6H1yb2tWfHWNzM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Norma","credit_id":"67dfaaac35bd26a7d94d87ed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2070491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aigul Akhmetshina","original_name":"Aigul Akhmetshina","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/kSc7Uq7ZqzS1KbUldUKKUT3gH0w.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Adalgisa","credit_id":"67dfaab9f6a0fcbd004d8e2f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3855299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Freddie De Tommaso","original_name":"Freddie De Tommaso","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Pollione","credit_id":"67dfaac7f6a0fcbd004d8e34","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3037136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tareq Nazmi","original_name":"Tareq Nazmi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/qxFCdoHNBNwPE5uA4BtyW8GHMay.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Oroveso","credit_id":"67dfaae3f6a0fcbd004d8e3e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5322588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victoria Leshkevich","original_name":"Victoria Leshkevich","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Clotilde","credit_id":"67dfaaf4e4a9c8690607c6e1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5322589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gustavo Quaresma","original_name":"Gustavo Quaresma","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Flavio","credit_id":"67dfab067d0565af0207bae2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2027593,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Francesco Lanzillotta","original_name":"Francesco Lanzillotta","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"67dfab47e4a9c8690607c6e7","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":957418,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vincenzo Bellini","original_name":"Vincenzo Bellini","popularity":0.0927,"profile_path":"/lpZpCuv3Qrm6m9ilagBpmil4mDz.jpg","credit_id":"67dfab3b7d0565af0207baf4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2230298,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vasily Barkhatov","original_name":"Vasily Barkhatov","popularity":0.0801,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dfab58f6a0fcbd004d8e56","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2346,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2c8plWX4qzfQvxORiCz1WEMS8d6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1562}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2025-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
