Using fear as a lens through which to explore the experiences of the Cuban people in the not-so-distant past, it offers an evocative and affective look at some of the central tensions in Cuban history.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Control de los cambios","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5059194,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hanzer González Garriga","original_name":"Hanzer González Garriga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dd9a6f29923784937a7adb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
