The Islamist wave did not come about accidentally, but instead is the result of recent history, of which Westerners are the actors, because in the vast majority of cases, it is the failure of a political and economic system, copied or imposed by the West, along with unbridled globalization, which opens a gaping hole and allows the rise of extremism.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/yYi1heBPJNaogVY7HqsTlEJmTJO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102669,"logo_path":"/b7WeslTaEl82WgOywyfWMDwXkWX.png","name":"Intermezzo Films","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":13668,"logo_path":"/azhapBvZ8g1UWyyQQhhcRR9bM9x.png","name":"RTS","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"ML","name":"Mali"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bambara","iso_639_1":"bm","name":"Bamanankan"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Birth of Extremist Movements in Africa","title":"Return to Bamako","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5321657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seymour Nor Tal","original_name":"Seymour Nor Tal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67deee6ee2bd135fcaf54568","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5321658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Issa N'Diaye","original_name":"Issa N'Diaye","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67deee804aa966ce8c69cdd3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5321660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Youssouf Dire","original_name":"Youssouf Dire","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67deee9aadf21a1668f5975d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5321661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seymour Badian Kouyate","original_name":"Seymour Badian Kouyate","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67deeeb1adf21a1668f59769","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168004,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Sarasin","original_name":"Jacques Sarasin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67def0cac2d819df69c6f4b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5322008,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Serge Elleinstein","original_name":"Serge Elleinstein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67df21697d0565af0207afca","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168004,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Sarasin","original_name":"Jacques Sarasin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67df21864ce07d684e07b209","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5322012,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aline Schmid","original_name":"Aline Schmid","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67df21cc4ce07d684e07b221","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168004,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Sarasin","original_name":"Jacques Sarasin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67df21ee7d0565af0207affc","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1554983,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rémon Fromont","original_name":"Rémon Fromont","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67df22044ce07d684e07b225","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yYi1heBPJNaogVY7HqsTlEJmTJO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"bm","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
