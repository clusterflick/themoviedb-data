With his kids completely hooked on snowboarding, he rallied a few friends and set out to build Yellowknife’s first and only rope tow. Without city permission or permits, Steve quietly went to work on the abandoned gravel mine on the outskirts of town, inadvertently creating the epicentre of snow-sliding in the Northwest Territories. This film tells the story of Bristol Pit - and the community that it's created - from the perspective of those who hand-built the pit and keep it running today.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/h2WaPZ2uRs009cq5DyTgwdVSb6G.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2024-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Welcome to the Pit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4633362,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seth Gillis","original_name":"Seth Gillis","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67df179bf6a0fcbd004d78b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3546929,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charlène Brochu","original_name":"Charlène Brochu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67df453f978bda8ae24d8359","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2427185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joey Schusler","original_name":"Joey Schusler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67df4723c2d819df69c7062a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1518095,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tim Symes","original_name":"Tim Symes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67df474135bd26a7d94d7808","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rFzYDY1kUfBNM3wfJ38MLRqXglN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h2WaPZ2uRs009cq5DyTgwdVSb6G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Banff Mountain Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Arc'teryx Presents: Welcome to the Pit","key":"oUggAeSP5TU","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2025-01-28T16:49:27.000Z","id":"67df47f14ce07d684e07b72d"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Arc'teryx Presents: Welcome to the Pit (TRAILER)","key":"abo7q-gqRRM","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-10-01T17:45:11.000Z","id":"67df4ad7e4a9c8690607babd"}]}}}
