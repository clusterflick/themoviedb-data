It documents the visit of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia to the town of Spala, where he stayed during a hunting trip. This film is one of the earliest examples of Polish cinema, and Matuszewski's work is notable for his role in the development of early documentary filmmaking in Poland. Like many films from this period, it is brief, and its primary focus is to capture a historical moment rather than to tell a narrative story.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1900-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tsar's Stay in Spala","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5322090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bolesław Matuszewski","original_name":"Bolesław Matuszewski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/2xQvtgRw3C4hq6AGpQcQhU5kpWs.jpg","credit_id":"67df30ac30e65e7beec6ffc8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5322090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bolesław Matuszewski","original_name":"Bolesław Matuszewski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/2xQvtgRw3C4hq6AGpQcQhU5kpWs.jpg","credit_id":"67df30c330e65e7beec6ffd2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1029357","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1900-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
