It speaks truthfully to the often dark and multilayered narratives, whilst celebrating the sheer power and moments of incomparable joy. It seeks to challenge the expectations of how a mother can behave, and explores the often unspoken emotions, unpaid labour, physical transitions, guilt, rage, sexuality, isolation and unrealistic expectations. It is intimate, contradictory and unapologetic.","popularity":0.0898,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":257154,"logo_path":null,"name":"Girls In Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MOTHERTONGUE","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5321240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Temitope Ajose","original_name":"Temitope Ajose","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67dec4c8e2bd135fcaf5379a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5321241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steph McMann","original_name":"Steph McMann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67dec4d31fee87c1bc7aaa1a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5321242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannah Shepherd","original_name":"Hannah Shepherd","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67dec4e029923784937ab149","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5321244,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darcy Wallace","original_name":"Darcy Wallace","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dec4fa0416875adc69ba3b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4908467,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Becs Rainey","original_name":"Becs Rainey","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dec515e2bd135fcaf537f0","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2850225,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Zoë Que","original_name":"Zoë Que","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dec542c70acdd9df69cbfd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4283774,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Clémentine Bartaud","original_name":"Clémentine Bartaud","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dec55feba8fd7a0d696d9a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1691,"name":"dance"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
