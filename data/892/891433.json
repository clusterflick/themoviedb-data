More than a decade later, scientists are still trying to locate the ducks, which they hoped to find scattered across the globe. Stray Ducks is the surreal and epic tale of these cute yellow toys and their mysterious disappearance. Anonymous, bobbing across the oceans, they observe human behaviour the world over. With a keen sense of irony and absurdist humour, this film takes an artistic as well as a critical perspective on social injustice and the climate crisis.
