Bernard Kudlak, the future artistic director, took exception to this prediction by an uninspired guidance counselor. This was the starting point of Cirque Plume: the story of a group of friends who, destined for the factory, chose to invent the lives of artists. With no technical training, they embarked on the adventure, unaware that they would contribute to the invention of a new artistic genre. Founders of the troupe, guest artists but also show technicians, administrators, cooks... Twenty-five characters tell us about the various stages of the troupe's construction, from the carefree days of their twenties to the need to reinvent themselves, from DIY to a cultural enterprise. An epic story shared by its protagonists.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/kuCLFFCpUyn1du3oVuwISTy4AcA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127757,"logo_path":"/hSsdu4Bonot1sliQYEOdpQvU6zm.png","name":"La Maison du Directeur","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/qpFsGoa96SytbWkhtkkpllu5Cch.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":163394,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tikkoun Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":134,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Grande Aventure Du Cirque Plume","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2247243,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antoine Page","original_name":"Antoine Page","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/coORGWUHJ9Izihx8IvwqICDWUfB.jpg","credit_id":"617aca9f0d5d85002af7e74b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16282982","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kuCLFFCpUyn1du3oVuwISTy4AcA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2021-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
