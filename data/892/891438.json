This documentary paints a portray of her at a time when, absorbed by her epic sci-fic trans pornography project, she has to juggle being evicted from her studio, Le Wonderland, her personal and family struggles with compulsive hoarding and her hectic lifestyle. Between the gargantuan sets in her studio, the complicated dilemmas she must face, and the robots spurting a mixture of Mentos and Sprite, this first feature by Laurence Turcotte-Fraser deftly interweaves elements of her inner and outer life to introduce us to an unconventional artist with a wide variety of different interests. The End of Wonderland gives a voice to one those oft-forgotten exhilarating personalities by sensitively exploring Tara Emory’s day-to-day life.
