The grainy, blurry images shot with the Super 8 camera and a soundtrack seeming to come from the far ends of the universe give the words of Laurence Olivier the feeling of some alien poem. As if the Other – ghosts or beings from another world – could also be transported by love and loss, by the impoverishment of the imagination and the transience of the material world. The invisible presence of ghosts seems to have found a witness here.","popularity":0.0457,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poème fantôme","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2628084,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurence Olivier","original_name":"Laurence Olivier","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/4wAKCdLl8uQ9g6E7s4liOXotFiR.jpg","credit_id":"617c16e2176a940043bb1edd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
