The ñomndaa women share ancient wisdom about their profession as weavers, rooted in breathtaking myths and the foremothers’ real life experiences. The elders decide that the only way to proceed is to look forward to the future, taking care of the young children left behind after their mother’s murder. Yecenia speaks through the radio, urging her local community to adopt new words, such as femicide, into their local tongue. Through this ritual, threads, dreams, and their craft are collectively woven together as an act of healing and resilience. In Prairie of Flowers, the act of weaving opens up to become an act of resistance in its own right.","popularity":0.0566,"poster_path":"/omwZtn37KSvlYXb0oqgjVlkCXLK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2021-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prairie Flowers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3288124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yecenia Lopez de Jesus","original_name":"Yecenia Lopez de Jesus","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"617acaa470b4440093c071a6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3288125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Divina de Jesus","original_name":"Divina de Jesus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"617acab5e9da6900434ad645","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1698552,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Josué Vergara","original_name":"Josué Vergara","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617acb17f031740042a44ba6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2294142,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mariana X.
