Her culture requires it, and her mother Amina imposes it on her. Born in Calabria to Muslim parents, the girl experiences all the conflicts and emotions typical of her age, but feels she is not like her peers: she is closed in her solitude, constantly out of place. Until one day the physical education teacher, Michele Scimone, suggests his students to sign up for the Sant'Antonio Marathon. For Fatima it is the first real opportunity to be seized. But for the teacher, a shy and depressed former runner, tormented by an unresolved past and a failed relationship with Anna, the veil that Fatima wears is a cause of prejudice.","popularity":0.1768,"poster_path":"/9Bp2zEFRR9mYYE7ObkSCKiTvki8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
