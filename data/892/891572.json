This ancestral art is observed from a distance, so as to never interrupt the movements of its practitioners. Rita Ferrando’s Ikebana is a hypnotic work with somewhat esoteric narration that highlights each step in the process with animations emphasizing the meticulous and meditative deeper meaning behind the art. This hybrid structure raises questions about the art of representation, inevitably present in cinema. How can we grasp the essence of what we want to show on film? Ikebana suggests that what we seek may be hidden well beyond the visible realm.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":"/kfMbEvlBQ6LApdtaGewuhFk3Rfa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ikebana","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2707956,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Brendan Mills","original_name":"Brendan Mills","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653b0a1c719aeb011b971832","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1472750,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacqueline De Niverville","original_name":"Jacqueline De Niverville","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653b0a02719aeb00c4894491","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3289282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rita Ferrando","original_name":"Rita Ferrando","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617c161171f0950042db6791","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1741159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lily Jue Sheng","original_name":"Lily Jue Sheng","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617c161a176a940043bb1d87","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kfMbEvlBQ6LApdtaGewuhFk3Rfa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
