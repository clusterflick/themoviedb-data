Structured around a number of interviews, notably one between the filmmaker and the energetic, eloquent, insightful and inspiring man himself. This intimate and unconventional documentary revisits the career and personal history of a remarkably creative nonagenarian with a fascinating life story. The film is a journey through the past that remains firmly anchored in the present, much like the photographer himself, who passionately continues to capture the poetry of daily life in his adopted homeland as he has done over the past six decades.","popularity":0.1187,"poster_path":"/fIAUU7Uyj4Dz9i3SCj66U2GkuNv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gabor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3642553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabor Szilasi","original_name":"Gabor Szilasi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"62e487a8fd4a96005d1ee1e4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1613531,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joannie Lafrenière","original_name":"Joannie Lafrenière","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"62e487d85b1240005efc6b59","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2377611,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Guillaume Daoust","original_name":"Guillaume Daoust","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e488248d2f8d005e63e4d2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3642558,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marc-André Labonté","original_name":"Marc-André Labonté","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e4880f9f51af00624d0728","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1837670,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gaëlle Komàr","original_name":"Gaëlle Komàr","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e4883057530e0058be68a2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1613531,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joannie Lafrenière","original_name":"Joannie Lafrenière","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617bb59c387651008c0eaae7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15943886","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fIAUU7Uyj4Dz9i3SCj66U2GkuNv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
