Slavery in modern times. Does it exist and what does it look like? In Bangladesh's textile industry, we see how the mechanisms linked to the western world's fashion industry are ravaging young women's attempts at a dignified life. Sabina, Ruma and Nazjnin work every day from early morning to late evening in the dangerous and dirty environment of the textile industry. The job provides no prerequisites for neither completing schooling, nor being able to move from the conditions in the slum. The rules at the factory are harsh and in order to provide for their families, they must continue to sew the clothes that we in the Western world want to buy as cheaply as possible. Who pays the price and is there light in this darkness?","popularity":0.0577,"poster_path":"/69rsFaxQQ5Uaa7YJPLj7VDBw9Lw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":163393,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nordic Light Cinematography","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BD","name":"Bangladesh"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Fashion Slaves","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Bangla Dreams","type":"Original Script Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1203117,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masud Akhond","original_name":"Masud Akhond","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/1lvz64lEIAedQHmtnm8Rv0cTj7X.jpg","credit_id":"617ac57de323f30025971866","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2056607,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sveinung Nygaard","original_name":"Sveinung Nygaard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617ac54eb458b87a83fcefad","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1203117,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masud Akhond","original_name":"Masud Akhond","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/1lvz64lEIAedQHmtnm8Rv0cTj7X.jpg","credit_id":"617ac705b458b87a83fcf2b0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1203117,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masud Akhond","original_name":"Masud Akhond","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/1lvz64lEIAedQHmtnm8Rv0cTj7X.jpg","credit_id":"617ac4ddd388ae008affdad0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928004,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nicklas Karpaty","original_name":"Nicklas Karpaty","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617ac4fec3aa3f00437f27b2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928004,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nicklas Karpaty","original_name":"Nicklas Karpaty","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617ac513e323f3009128ca81","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":557758,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lars Jameson","original_name":"Lars Jameson","popularity":0.0523,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617ac524e9da6900434acb84","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":579768,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pierre Laurent","original_name":"Pierre Laurent","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/fy3OX1MtK8ESAWAN8y6ZBUlaBoQ.jpg","credit_id":"617ac567c3aa3f00934657c6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8186328","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/69rsFaxQQ5Uaa7YJPLj7VDBw9Lw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":729}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
