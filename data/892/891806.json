The hijacking was also an act of desperation committed by two people in their early twenties who saw no other way to escape what they felt was the constant state of racial oppression in America. Living in Paris forty years after the hijacking and unable to return to the U.S., Melvin and Jean are still coming to terms with their crime and its lifelong consequences.","popularity":0.2083,"poster_path":"/l58KJmz9Kb1K1NDkuneTXVynVGi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Melvin & Jean: An American Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":73791,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matthieu Belghiti","original_name":"Matthieu Belghiti","popularity":0.0613,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629d4d78992fe600a6056933","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2133858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maia Wechsler","original_name":"Maia Wechsler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629d4d7efed59700966ff7aa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2359087,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Adam Zucker","original_name":"Adam Zucker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629d4d6fdc1cb40e4713f3d0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20559,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sophie Brunet","original_name":"Sophie Brunet","popularity":0.1128,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629d4d61fed597005182212d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1727891,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Vincent Trisolini","original_name":"Vincent Trisolini","popularity":0.0645,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629d4d67caa5081aeefa625b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2133858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maia Wechsler","original_name":"Maia Wechsler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617cc8b367825900627e7861","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12372492","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1429,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l58KJmz9Kb1K1NDkuneTXVynVGi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Melvin & Jean: An American Story - Trailer","key":"85999526","site":"Vimeo","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-02-06T07:49:10.000Z","id":"617cc67e84f249008d3a455e"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Melvin et Jean ( La r√©volte et l'exil ) - Trailer","key":"WgiFdBT3-d4","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2011-01-31T12:15:36.000Z","id":"617cc712651fcf008ecc9885"}]}}}
