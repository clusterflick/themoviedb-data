As an homage to the great fairy tales of the past, “How To Raise a Black Boy” opens with the cover of a book, intricately carved in wood with a boy and a man on either side. “I remember home, or at least I can imagine it.” This is the voice of narrator Rayceen Pendarvis of the iconic voguing House of Pendarvis, known to many as “Mother”. The narrator is an omniscient presence, a fairy godmother, who speaks as one of the boys.","popularity":0.1903,"poster_path":"/dgZfUfEoMCMsgUZuR0LgOZwRThk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Four Black boys disappear one night, as many Black boys do, and find themselves on a fantastical journey to break the curses of Black boyhood.","title":"How to Raise a Black Boy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3288709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maiya Blaney","original_name":"Maiya Blaney","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"617b4492d6dbba0066c8889b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3288710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodney Chrome","original_name":"Rodney Chrome","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"617b449cfdc4fa00420fb452","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3288711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Coston-Payne","original_name":"Christian Coston-Payne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"617b44aa0d5d850065f835cc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3157189,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emperor Kaioyus","original_name":"Emperor Kaioyus","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"617b44b5f03174002a1f5ed6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":154216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Payne","original_name":"Eric Payne","popularity":0.2281,"profile_path":"/vWzmGpV07VvEHGplnXaNewFtO9a.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"617b44c4d236e60065048879","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3288713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rayceen Pendarvis","original_name":"Rayceen Pendarvis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"617b44ce229ae200649d69bf","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3288714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justin Smith","original_name":"Justin Smith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"617b44e3b4a543008b103a39","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3288715,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicklaus Vallie","original_name":"Nicklaus Vallie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"617b44ec0d5d8500916c0294","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3288716,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cory Walkers","original_name":"Cory Walkers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"617b44f5d236e6002a850523","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3208800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justice Jamal Jones","original_name":"Justice Jamal Jones","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/9EfNISCU4NAaCFlEIZV9pajkJFz.jpg","credit_id":"617b452fb458b800933497ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3288719,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joseph Neilon Magee","original_name":"Joseph Neilon Magee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617b4573cb6db5008d4345e5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3208800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justice Jamal Jones","original_name":"Justice Jamal Jones","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/9EfNISCU4NAaCFlEIZV9pajkJFz.jpg","credit_id":"617b4540b4a5430043cd4454","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3288719,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joseph Neilon Magee","original_name":"Joseph Neilon Magee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617b4584a097dc002aaad155","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3288717,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Justine Sweetman","original_name":"Justine Sweetman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617b4551f03174002a1f6084","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15090798","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dgZfUfEoMCMsgUZuR0LgOZwRThk.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":853,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xxd6su76S4HfNmeFKH1sQsjOpW7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":569}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
