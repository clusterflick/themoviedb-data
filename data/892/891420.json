Natural sounds without commentary. The slowly grazing sheep shuffle, gather, and begin flowing through the valley, a soft, blurry river of wool. They stop, clump together, collect their feet, and lie down quietly to chew their cuds. Sleep. Awake! Pressing together along the road; moving to the highlands, hooves thundering; voices yowling. Fresh grass. Ewes call their lambs. Bouncing over nothing, bleating, the lambs search out their mothers. Milk. Heads banging, the lambs play. pushing, jostling, and scurrying together into the darkness.","popularity":0.0973,"poster_path":"/bJByGK6LuKSOnNTVS5p8EF17FzO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sheep, Sheep, Sheep","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1624177,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michael D.
