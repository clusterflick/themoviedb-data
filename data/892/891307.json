The young lovers in rural China are framed by their evil landlord. The man is sent to prison; the woman is forced to get married. She tries to seek revenge but is killed. When the man is released from prison, he joins the People's Volunteer Army but is killed in battle. The film was significant in its time. Runje Shaw had imported advanced American audio film equipment and technology in 1931, making this one of the first sound films in China. As one of Unique's few ‘progress' films, it also reflects that this ‘entertainment-only', apolitical film company, under the left-wing influences in society, also needed to make films with topics such as the war effort and that criticise the bourgeoisie. Struggle is a joint effort among the best of talents in front of and behind the camera, and is also the only surviving work of director Qiu Qixiang.","popularity":0.1546,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":163421,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unique Film (Shanghai)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1933-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Struggle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"九江血戰","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3288827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chan Yoke-mui","original_name":"Chan Yoke-mui","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"617b6492229ae2002a5a0456","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3288828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liu Binghua","original_name":"Liu Binghua","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"617b649ca097dc00922046fe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3288829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xiao Zhengzhong","original_name":"Xiao Zhengzhong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"617b64a5e9da69002ba2f85b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2723627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zhenduo Zhang","original_name":"Zhenduo Zhang","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"617b64b071f0950042da989a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3288830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Qiu Qi-Xiang","original_name":"Qiu Qi-Xiang","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617b64ecfdc4fa005f840587","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3288832,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yu Szu (Yu Ding-Xun)","original_name":"Yu Szu (Yu Ding-Xun)","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617b6575cb6db50042ae6e59","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":393,"name":"civil war"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"1933-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
