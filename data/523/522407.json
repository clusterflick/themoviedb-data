One beautiful summer evening Mikko and his wife Liisa invite old friends to a party in the villa: divorced intellectual Erik who gets along a little too well with Liisa; and noisy building contractor Hessu with his young and sexy new wife Pirre. Their increasingly drunken discussions are interrupted by a surprise visit from Mikko's and Liisa's daughter Jonna and her husband Pete. A conflict between the father and the daughter ensues in front of the guests.","popularity":0.6325,"poster_path":"/18XnRuAy5yMcfrHIAlLOnTYBIju.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98926,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmiauer","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1981-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yö
