Many marched through the city calling for the resignation of School Superintendent Benjamin Willis, who placed trailers, dubbed ‘Willis Wagons,’ on playgrounds and parking lots of overcrowded black schools rather than let them enroll in nearby white schools. Combining unseen archival 16mm footage of the march shot by Kartemquin founder Gordon Quinn with the participants’ reflections today, ’63 Boycott connects the forgotten story of one of the largest northern civil rights demonstrations to contemporary issues around race, education, school closings, and youth activism.","popularity":0.0612,"poster_path":"/d8OZ01jPLW4W18EqxaEmisjxMv5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13042,"logo_path":"/k57hcv8sELrZCf1j33FDBNGDpF6.png","name":"Kartemquin Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"'63 Boycott","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gordon Quinn","original_name":"Gordon Quinn","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b26f529c3a36841f301653c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2067021,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tracye Matthews","original_name":"Tracye Matthews","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b26f6009251410d6001583b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2067020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rachel Dickson","original_name":"Rachel Dickson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b26f5bec3a36841cf0177bc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2490508","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5tohcvN4VAz7zCjCVQZVh7I6TbQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/d8OZ01jPLW4W18EqxaEmisjxMv5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"'63 Boycott - Today is Freedom Day","key":"mgj7JKY3nP4","published_at":"2013-01-18T15:20:41.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Clip","official":true,"id":"5b26f2fb9251410d720127f6"}]}}}
