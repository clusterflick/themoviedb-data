Micaela, José's Mother, and Mörd (Death) are played by the same dancer. The action is reduced to a single act in 13 scenes. The love scenes are played to a minimum and the working women's fight is adjourned to the last scene [and cut from some DVD editions] that concentrates all the pathos announced throughout by the eerie music.","popularity":0.3006,"poster_path":"/7DR4ajgghHOo4e4g3TWiVFQFYIT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38242,"logo_path":null,"name":"RM
