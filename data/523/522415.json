Private art collector Theodor \"Teto\" Ahrenberg obtained art directly by artists like Picasso, Chagall and Matisse. He became friends with the international artists elite. And therefore developed a conflict with the Swedish art establishment. The Director of the Modern museum Pontus Hultén became his nemesis. Revenge to Theodor Ahrenberg would be creating his own art museum of Stockholm. Designed by world-famous architect Le Corbusier.","popularity":0.1025,"poster_path":"/bJBK2TNRwvWFvaZBDDRKeeG16LR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2999,"logo_path":"/zGSqFee9aDgDuLD6vcs2mcJUem4.png","name":"SVT","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2017-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Konstsamlaren
