Known in the U.S. primarily as Merton’s best friend and in Europe as a daringly original avant-garde poet, Lax lived a life of simplicity, humility and grace that continues to encourage and motivate readers and followers.  This film is a portrait of Robert Lax as he was to those who were fortunate to visit him during his thirty years of living on the Greek island of Patmos.","popularity":0.095,"poster_path":"/wddqJXx5YGYYYGo6AUWBlXQseFL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94041,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cine Nomad","origin_country":""},{"id":162,"logo_path":"/pIK5tsFVxjoXTJGcd0nYhiL1kn1.png","name":"BR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1999-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Why Should I Buy A Bed When All That I Want Is Sleep?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1874619,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert Lax","original_name":"Robert Lax","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"600fddae4d0e8d003f7b3cac","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":68043,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Werner Penzel","original_name":"Werner Penzel","popularity":0.0666,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aedd192c3a368347000c097","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68042,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Humbert","original_name":"Nicolas Humbert","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fdf65f6f706de003e806ef6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68042,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Humbert","original_name":"Nicolas Humbert","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601fee9f60b58d003fd6e2b3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":68043,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Werner Penzel","original_name":"Werner Penzel","popularity":0.0666,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601feea7dd25890040b5bf27","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0313785","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":2161,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wddqJXx5YGYYYGo6AUWBlXQseFL.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1536},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1453,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qxGKOx1vK1q24OCeW1W7dDKR5ug.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":967}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1999-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
