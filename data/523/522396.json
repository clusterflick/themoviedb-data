Studying under pioneering artist William de Kooning, she was able to find her own path and grow from his influence. Her patterns and grids come alive with the materiality and physicality of her paintings. Watch as Pasloff describes her experiences painting, gaining an education in art, and as her visual language of emotion comes alive.","popularity":0.2347,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pat Passlof: …unexpected conversation…","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2036168,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Page","original_name":"Bill Page","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aecf22cc3a3683473002e4b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2679,"name":"artist"},{"id":437,"name":"painter"},{"id":215853,"name":"abstract art"},{"id":244180,"name":"abstract expressionism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Greenpoint Film Festival","release_date":"2018-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
