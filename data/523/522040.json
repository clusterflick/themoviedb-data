The film follows first time volunteer and filmmaker, Adriana Luhovy, as she learns about the children and becomes witness to their strengths and resilience.  Converging in Yaremche in the Carpathian Mountains of Ukraine, over 500 orphaned children come together from all over the country. At first quiet and fearful, they learn to trust one another and their counsellors. By countering heartbreaking statistics - 60% of orphaned girls are trafficked within the first year of leaving the orphanage; 50% of boys end up in jail; 10% commit suicide - the volunteers are dedicated to making a difference in the lives of orphaned Ukrainian children.","popularity":0.3898,"poster_path":"/ydYP9NTmTnXE1vki6Cg1NgZSmxb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Second Chance","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2035011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adriana Luhovy","original_name":"Adriana Luhovy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aea6434925141106000096b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1328040,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Yurij Luhovy","original_name":"Yurij Luhovy","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aea645d925141109c0008b5","department":"Production","job":"Consulting Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2035012,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Oksana Rozumna","original_name":"Oksana Rozumna","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aea6476c3a36809570004d5","department":"Writing","job":"Script Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1521,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ydYP9NTmTnXE1vki6Cg1NgZSmxb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3817,"name":"chance"},{"id":8054,"name":"volunteer"},{"id":13014,"name":"orphan"},{"id":34004,"name":"second chance"},{"id":243182,"name":"carpathian mountains"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Second Chance - Documentary on orphaned children in Ukraine","key":"uNYsy628V2U","published_at":"2014-01-09T06:44:06.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5aea638792514110820005a6"}]}}}
