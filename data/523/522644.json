Performers include: Luther Allison: lead guitar, vocals; James Solberg: rhythm & lead guitar; Mike Vlahakis: keyboards; Ken Faltinson: bass; Robb Stupka: drums; and Memphis Horns (Wayne Jackson, Andrew Love).","popularity":0.304,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Luther Allison: Songs from the Road","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1152419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luther Allison","original_name":"Luther Allison","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/kUFjTKmyxWurvqOWJjKGACabJrH.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself - Lead Guitar & Vocals","credit_id":"5aef33db925141764a006f53","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2037491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Solberg","original_name":"James Solberg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself - Rhythm & Lead Guitar","credit_id":"5aef34000e0a261d9900723f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1772534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Vlahakis","original_name":"Mike Vlahakis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself - Keyboards","credit_id":"5aef3446c3a3681f8b00a950","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2037493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Faltinson","original_name":"Ken Faltinson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself - Bass","credit_id":"5aef3482925141766c0044fb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2037494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robb Stupka","original_name":"Robb Stupka","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself - Drums","credit_id":"5aef34ad0e0a261d8f006e6d","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11634,"name":"live performance"},{"id":175506,"name":"blues music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
