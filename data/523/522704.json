When he is severely injured by strikebreakers, his wife, Esther, and infant son are left destitute. Desperate to save her starving child, Esther gives him up for adoption to a wealthy couple, and then commits suicide. The richly-rendered beautiful Yiddish songs by Sholem Secunda featuring Cantor Leibele Waldman and Joel Feig's famous choir are a good example of the bittersweet melodrama in the finest tradition of the Yiddish theater.","popularity":0.328,"poster_path":"/pU3Xj4L6kPmCx5v4khBuAMrwxzd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14000,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinema Service
