Among the places visited are Aylesbury, where Benjamin Disraeli got his start in politics; Abinger Hammer, site of the Church of St. John the Evangelist; and Chalfont, St. Giles, where the cottage in which poet John Milton finished his epic \"Paradise Lost\" still stands. The people are also featured, including farmers, town merchants, and furniture makers who still produce items by hand in their outdoor factory.  â€”David Glagovsky","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1945-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"There'll Always Be an England","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4326760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Roddy","original_name":"Tom Roddy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"652fc708ea84c7010c1e19b2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4326758,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kent Stevenson","original_name":"Kent Stevenson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652fc6fbcaef2d00c527ea2f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0184946","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1945-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
