Travel around California with Annie, a former sex worker, Beth, a professor, and their dog Butch, in their E.A.R.T.H. Lab mobile unit, as they explore water in the Golden State. Ecosexuality shifts the metaphor “Earth as Mother” to “Earth as Lover” to create a more reciprocal and empathetic relationship with the natural world. Along the way, Annie and Beth interact with a diverse range of folks including performance artists, biologists, water treatment plant workers, scholars and others, climaxing in a shocking event that reaffirms the power of water, life and love.","popularity":0.1132,"poster_path":"/xDdAtk7rQ4l7VmbrFsZNwZQH6dw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Water Makes Us Wet: An Ecosexual Adventure","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Water Makes Us Wet","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1991769,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beth Stephens","original_name":"Beth Stephens","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aeb87bcc3a36872ac000a1c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":98384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Sprinkle","original_name":"Annie Sprinkle","popularity":3.664,"profile_path":"/yI2bWCryXvfVpq99g5nkNM3TkfW.jpg","credit_id":"5b8bf9a4c3a368520203966f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9854782","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lyWwjtTDnpqF8InjfeZJPsJJR2d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dx6hBFRfBoZbOXbQukElr1cFwkH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xDdAtk7rQ4l7VmbrFsZNwZQH6dw.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1067},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vHEpaSVG2mXExI3OVEImsIJv8Rk.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDb","release_date":"2019-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"WATER MAKES US WET trailer | BFI Flare 2019","key":"-XgjS4soAMk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2019-02-28T10:54:20.000Z","id":"64557cf557d378013708de10"}]}}}
