But fame and fortune don't come easily. Often mocked and ostracized (until they achieve their goal), inventors see the world in a distinct way. Duru is no different. The son of Romanian immigrants, he's driven by a desire to achieve the impossible—and to cash in. Exploring the banality of Duru's trial-and-error efforts, director Bogdan Stoica is an artistic risk-taker worthy of his subject. He allows contemplative scenes to develop in real-time with immaculate framing; a natural tension builds as we witness Duru strapping the equivalent of high-speed lawn mower blades to his feet. Avoiding the temptation to sensationalize and thus trivialize his subject, Stoica reveals a rich story about immigration, settlement and the human desire to transcend our physical confines.  -Alexander Rogalski (Hot Docs Film Festival)","popularity":0.4699,"poster_path":"/5pSagFve9E0VqxIErMiT3ZHcFE5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2018-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Omni: An Act against Gravity","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2037709,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Catherine Bergeron","original_name":"Catherine Bergeron","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aef798e0e0a261d9d00a04d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2037708,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bogdan Stoica","original_name":"Bogdan Stoica","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aef79bdc3a3681f8b00e783","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2037708,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bogdan Stoica","original_name":"Bogdan Stoica","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aef7a030e0a261d7400968d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2037709,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Catherine Bergeron","original_name":"Catherine Bergeron","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aef7a13925141765e009ecb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1898036,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ciwan Haco","original_name":"Ciwan Haco","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aef7a6cc3a368140c00b7c6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2037712,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Peter Hostak","original_name":"Peter Hostak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aef7a84c3a368141b00c472","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2037708,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bogdan Stoica","original_name":"Bogdan Stoica","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aef79ae0e0a261d8f0097f3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2037709,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Catherine Bergeron","original_name":"Catherine Bergeron","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aef7a390e0a261d7400969d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2037708,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bogdan Stoica","original_name":"Bogdan Stoica","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aef79710e0a261d8c009c8e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2037711,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Artashes Avetian","original_name":"Artashes Avetian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aef7a5a0e0a261d72008ca7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"OmniAnActAgainstGravity","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5pSagFve9E0VqxIErMiT3ZHcFE5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1436,"name":"inventor"},{"id":1576,"name":"technology"},{"id":226370,"name":"hoverboard"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2018-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Hot Docs 2018 Trailers: OMNI: AN ACT AGAINST GRAVITY","key":"H5ToRA7KSS8","published_at":"2018-03-20T14:36:32.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5aef7ba8c3a368140c00b863"}]}}}
