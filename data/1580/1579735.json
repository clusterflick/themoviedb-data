Fred meets Slavomir, who comes from Bosnia. He is stuck with papers and is begging following an attack; Fred takes him in while he gets out of this bad situation. During this stopover Slavomir meets Fred's friends and provokes mixed reactions from them. From parties to concerts and songs to dances, Slavomir shares their evenings and discussions in these times of political excitement.  A melancholic comedy around ideals in conflict with disillusionment.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/kFKEpykJwyhLhAkHX4lhgIAjAXk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":280316,"logo_path":null,"name":"Philippe Kastelnik(Auto financé)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L’ENTRE DEUX TOURS","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5813553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emmanuel Gil","original_name":"Emmanuel Gil","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6915014891a3814cebdd2fa5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5813554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"jasmin ljutic","original_name":"jasmin ljutic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"691501632ea0461e539c4e17","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5813560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline demourgues","original_name":"Caroline demourgues","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6915023aa22fcf5f0140df55","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5813563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"remy deney","original_name":"remy deney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6915025ece9c1f48f79ad2ab","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2746462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emmanuel Dulary","original_name":"Emmanuel Dulary","popularity":0.0707,"profile_path":"/nDyymF0hFLIVQtdwPCVRetKBlVX.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"691502974194ebdee1ac214d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5813568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"augustin mulliez","original_name":"augustin mulliez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"691502d7bf95473d1aa0da37","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5813570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"claire Garapon","original_name":"claire Garapon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"69150320d20f50e31d3a41db","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4162708,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephanie Noel","original_name":"Stephanie Noel","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"69150356a4a1c96cc831c557","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5813571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stella B.
