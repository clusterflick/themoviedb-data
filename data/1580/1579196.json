Seven years in the making, Fillos do Vento: A RAPA places viewers inside the curro, where dust, breath and tension blur the line between tradition and extinction. A modern-day Quixote story, as wind-farms creep over the surrounding hills, the work challenges audiences to feel the fight for cultural survival in an age of rapid change.  This documentary is not meant to be watched but inhabited, a sensorial call to witness what is at stake when culture, nature and modernity collide.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/81kY04mYH1lCqlPhOAzuVguY8fB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":280199,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinexin Studios","origin_country":""},{"id":280200,"logo_path":null,"name":"100 Sutton Studios","origin_country":""},{"id":280201,"logo_path":null,"name":"Evernia Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Galician","iso_639_1":"gl","name":"Galego"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What wildness will we choose to preserve?","title":"Children of the Wind","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5811584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brais Revaldería","original_name":"Brais Revaldería","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6913d2fcd60b32fd17c06a37","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5811584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brais Revaldería","original_name":"Brais Revaldería","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6913d30fa3d94d8baa31bcca","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5811588,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Eduardo Garcia","original_name":"Eduardo Garcia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6913d366acf1fb94b8c06b1e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5811589,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Juan Thomas Cano","original_name":"Juan Thomas Cano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6913d3aad1da7ed6a2875e20","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5811591,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sebastian Nazario Colo","original_name":"Sebastian Nazario Colo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6913d3bfdec48a90c1d26267","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2872930,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Álex Aller","original_name":"Álex Aller","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6913d3cd14dc73b323d26386","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5811584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brais Revaldería","original_name":"Brais Revaldería","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6913d40cc49fa5cfa4dd2ab4","department":"Production","job":"Production Executive"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5811593,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"María Fernanda Ordóñez Morla","original_name":"María Fernanda Ordóñez Morla","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6913d41878a31ad1cbdd2cee","department":"Production","job":"Production Executive"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5789703,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pedro Revaldería","original_name":"Pedro Revaldería","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6913d4264d06e33f414c8bfa","department":"Production","job":"Production Executive"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31500100","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"fillosdovento_arapa","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1103,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6jF53uroEeZBqTJ61hscKybDDnc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1960}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1903,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/81kY04mYH1lCqlPhOAzuVguY8fB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1269}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":250135,"name":"cannes"},{"id":288075,"name":"immersive"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2025-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Fillos do vento - A RAPA   /  Immersive experience. 2025 Teaser","key":"1072008273","site":"Vimeo","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-04-03T01:52:52.000Z","id":"6913d59bb82cc8c707dd2eaf"}]}}}
