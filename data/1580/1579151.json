Using anything and everyone at hand - an art dealer, a fashion editor, an actress, a poet, a museum of natural history, a junkyard dog, pigeons, a defunct ferry - the video takes the potential impatience that lurks behind every act of plotting and atomizes it into a frayed network of fleeting thoughts and impulses, a delicate narrative that ends like a magic trick in a puff of smoke.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ayPljmFq68QeWl5lJkUtQOp22wE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paris From Behind","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5297405,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Antek Walczak","original_name":"Antek Walczak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6913bfed5b452b4483a0d54f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":752,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ayPljmFq68QeWl5lJkUtQOp22wE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":752,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xR6bq1lhXOdTCGfgCOfgjztIpCf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
