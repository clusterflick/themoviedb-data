They faced numerous challenges in a society that opposed cinema. The film also uncovers the cinematic life that existed in Saudi Arabia before 1979, investigating the earliest screenings and film productions through an engaging narrative told by the pioneering figures of Saudi cinema. It is a documentary journey spanning five years of research and exploration, offering a living testament to a passion that never faded despite the obstacles.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ضد السينما","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
