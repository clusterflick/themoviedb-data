The conflict arises when this transmission doesn't always align with individual desires: between shared passion and one's own voice in the face of a dilemma.  Choosing a football team isn't an individual decision, but rather a process of family socialization where loyalty to the club is passed down from parents to children as part of the family's identity and traditions.  The club isn't automatically inherited like a surname: it's negotiated, contested, and sometimes betrayed. In this tension (between tradition, choice, and rebellion), the identity of the fans is at stake.","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":"/iZl4mk8sIk9LsoVzpyOm1ZmSIKW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"In Argentina, football is not a choice: it is inherited.","title":"How I do it","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5041304,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Tomás Martinese","original_name":"Tomás Martinese","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6914ca32a770ff38c5c070a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5041289,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Franco Ezequiel Insaurralde","original_name":"Franco Ezequiel Insaurralde","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6914ca3e25425a821b9c4c2d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5813173,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antonella Vijil Morin","original_name":"Antonella Vijil Morin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6914ca5a352b2467e7ac2046","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5041282,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Constanza Paula Baroni","original_name":"Constanza Paula Baroni","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6914ca6d579b325ab63a3f4d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5041297,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marina Yael Shlez","original_name":"Marina Yael Shlez","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6914ca80595b54d1ff31c61c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4629228,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cielo Iturralde Carrera","original_name":"Maria Cielo Iturralde Carrera","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6914cab61913c5a927dd2cf1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5041295,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nahuel Rodriguez","original_name":"Nahuel Rodriguez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6914cac4600d16f5aedd3543","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5041304,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Tomás Martinese","original_name":"Tomás Martinese","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6914cace579b325ab63a3f50","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5041289,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Franco Ezequiel Insaurralde","original_name":"Franco Ezequiel Insaurralde","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6914cadafe08b67726a0da28","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4015750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Agustín Russo","original_name":"Agustín Russo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6914caf49b2ed4e73f9c4d2b","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Car"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5041299,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tobías Sanjuan","original_name":"Tobías Sanjuan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6914cb00443c9c2d8287630c","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Car"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5041309,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Maia Martinez Aref","original_name":"Maia Martinez Aref","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6914cb0e3cd80ce17f3a3e53","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Car"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1600,"iso_3166_1":"ES","iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/iZl4mk8sIk9LsoVzpyOm1ZmSIKW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1131}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
