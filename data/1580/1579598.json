When he returns to her, he hides his cowardice, lying about the events. He paints himself the hero, and the woman, comatose, his silent alibi. The writer struggles no more, his fiction now bound in book, his tell-tale heart soothed by success. Soon, sinister fans accost and quiz, cracking his veneer. His late nights now haunted by visions. Frayed, the writer returns to his source, the woman, that he might see light through the colour of her eyes.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Colour of Her Eyes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1578093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Graham Neale","original_name":"Graham Neale","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6914b2f89e88fb480d875fa0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2332776","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
