The latter holds his position through his descent from \"Pirate\" Kaye, who founded the line, rather than through any executive ability of his own. Shirley is queen of the most exclusive Long Island set, and as clever as she is lovely to look at. From the West comes T.J. Magen, a rough but lion-hearted financier, who buys the house next door to the Kayes. Magen cares little for society, and the elaborate household which their wealth forces them to support is a constant worry to his simple and unassuming wife. But the daughter, \"Daisy,\" yearns, with all her heart to break into the society and swim where Shirley Kaye reigns supreme.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4fMwqsBV5PN662RKQ8ldEnOwzkb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92434,"logo_path":null,"name":"Clara Kimball Young Film Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-12-29","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shirley Kaye","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Det svage køns sejr","type":"Danish title"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"En flicka från Östern","type":"Swedish title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1023476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clara Kimball Young","original_name":"Clara Kimball Young","popularity":0.0765,"profile_path":"/zMsyHsgLM1XuZyQlYPVeepATc5o.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Shirley Kaye","credit_id":"6913c456acf1fb94b8c06aa3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2377216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corliss Giles","original_name":"Corliss Giles","popularity":0.0513,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"John Rowson","credit_id":"6913c470600d16f5aedd305e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":262394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Fawcett","original_name":"George Fawcett","popularity":0.1333,"profile_path":"/pZBmcj6XkdBkNKvUIovZMNqg8qU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"T.L.
