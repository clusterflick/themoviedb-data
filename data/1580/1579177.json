In an increasingly complex and divided world, artist Jinny Yu asks, what is on the other side of us? Through the act of painting, Jinny explores uneasy and shifting realities - what does it mean to be a painter, and an activist? Could one navigate being an insider and an outsider at the same time? Through this meandering conversation on migration which inspired her work for the 56th Venice Biennale, Don't They Ever Stop Migrating? we are brought along a journey of self discovery that leaves viewers with important questions we must ask ourselves. The film was a collaboration between Jinny and a team of frequent collaborators, Hingman Leung, Adrienne Row - Smith, and Justin Li, supported by the Agnes Etherington Art Centre.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Migration Musings","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5811480,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jinny Yu","original_name":"Jinny Yu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6913c97178a31ad1cbdd2cca","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1440482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liang Xinwen","original_name":"Liang Xinwen","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6913c9ab3c6c3c652c4c8ed3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5811484,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Adrienne Row - Smith","original_name":"Adrienne Row - Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6913c9b7dc4f028746a0d43f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5811485,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Casper Slack","original_name":"Casper Slack","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6913c9c08ee8d331b8d26371","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4778345,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Deighan Morrison","original_name":"Deighan Morrison","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6913c9d3844b9a308c9c4892","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
