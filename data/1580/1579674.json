For half a decade, Hannah Spector has been travelling to West Texas multiple times a year to listen to this landscape. Their exhibition at Women & Their Work, if you stare at a cowboy’s face for long enough, it turns into a sunset, places queer bodies within a new mythos–one that turns against the hyperreal object of the American West as an imperial proving ground.  Featuring a multichannel sound and video installation with ceramic sculpture and copper-plate etchings, Spector projects a new future–one that disrupts gender norms, power systems within language, linear notions of time, and limiting means of self-expression.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"if you stare at a cowboy's face for long enough, it turns into a sunset","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
