As strange forces rise and monsters cross into their world, a group of kids must face the unimaginable while discovering the true meaning of friendship, courage, and sacrifice.\r At the heart of it all is Eleven, a girl with telekinetic powers and a painful past. Alongside her friends Mike, Will, Dustin, Lucas, and Max, she fights to protect Hawkins from the dark entity known as the Mind Flayer — a creature that threatens not just their town, but existence itself.\r Now, years later, as new horrors emerge and the portals reopen, the group must reunite one last time to end what they started. With secrets from the government unraveling, love being tested, and fate closing in, they’ll discover that the real monster may not be from another world — but from within.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ouYfdvTy1fZbVfBLhmBy6tlo5Ja.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":2,"runtime":999,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Every ending has its beginning.","title":"Stranger Things","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":1200,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ouYfdvTy1fZbVfBLhmBy6tlo5Ja.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":811}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
