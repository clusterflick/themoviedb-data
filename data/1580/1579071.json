This old man has come to Moscow from a village; he suffers from loneliness and the alien city life. He gladly communicates only with the stray street birds, although he lives in a nice apartment with his daughter and son-in-law. They, in turn, to distract him from sad old-man thoughts and purely out of good intentions, decide to find him a wife and select \"brides\" for him. All three brides come to the meeting, and many funny situations arise because, by mistake, they all came at once. These three brides are pensioners — an eccentric former ballerina, a strict former nurse from a psychiatric hospital, and a kind-hearted mother of a family. But among these lonely elderly people, interest in each other awakens, warm relationships develop, and there is hope that something in life will change.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/gMdLljx8hLZSmtzAVRB5PbGHinY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60038,"logo_path":"/wlwwFT1T3byi98Ud51ZbIVCIjwC.png","name":"Central Television USSR","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1984-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Retro","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":562644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Lyubeznov","original_name":"Иван Любезнов","popularity":0.8365,"profile_path":"/527jhDAN0GUHYOQJbsyd53D3zqs.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Чмутин","credit_id":"69139d77579b325ab63a39f2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4619831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamara Torchinskaya","original_name":"Тамара Торчинская","popularity":0.538,"profile_path":"/yHds8M0XKnj1P7LMnxasV8SGlG0.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Людмила","credit_id":"69139d7d95143dfa46a0d2bf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1400626,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vyacheslav Yezepov","original_name":"Вячеслав Езепов","popularity":0.6969,"profile_path":"/jm8mltdzbwNGN5qqwQdJRNkzh6H.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Леонид Иванович","credit_id":"69139d8495aa21afb7a0d31d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1961492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Galina Dyomina","original_name":"Галина Дёмина","popularity":0.7127,"profile_path":"/t09svfoyfALX4P0D0ZeGywTo7ms.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Воронкова","credit_id":"69139d9841b0b93d78a0d49e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4469594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Ovchinnikova","original_name":"Мария Овчинникова","popularity":0.4362,"profile_path":"/iwgRweKT5i1rxdNFKxldElEmS64.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Писачинская","credit_id":"69139da091326c06e2dd2baa","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":935419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizaveta Solodova","original_name":"Елизавета Солодова","popularity":0.8581,"profile_path":"/krzw1V691y8MHB7UK5W94cb36Gr.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Барабанова","credit_id":"69139da8248fb4e7cbaa2183","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2386842,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leonid Heyfets","original_name":"Леонид Хейфец","popularity":0.4422,"profile_path":"/33DXODWbacEV0FDATU1cZY6cAfA.jpg","credit_id":"69139cfa2768a98e62c06a93","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":652689,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aleksandr Galin","original_name":"Александр Галин","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69139d31d3f869f103d2650b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2162361,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrey Tyupkin","original_name":"Андрей Тюпкин","popularity":0.0699,"profile_path":"/kCt3mH88gSuGPUqHrpk6Rgfz4Lb.jpg","credit_id":"69139d42f12a41dda4c06a37","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4570861,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Rafael Akopov","original_name":"Рафаэль Акопов","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69139d4aa88999b19ad26357","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2719945,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"David Borovskiy","original_name":"Давид Боровский","popularity":0.0975,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69139d57883685b575a0bae9","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gMdLljx8hLZSmtzAVRB5PbGHinY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
