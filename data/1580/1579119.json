Through people’s testimonies and visual material, viewers are invited to reflect on whether it is possible to reclaim what time and water have washed away. Once one of Latvia’s most popular sightseeing spots, Staburags has been widely celebrated in legends, folktales, and songs. Audiences will have the opportunity to see rare footage filmed 40 meters below the surface of the Daugava River, as well as follow a modern expedition during which special equipment was used to check whether the 18–20 meter-high Staburags cliff still remains in its place.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":118793,"logo_path":"/AckxUfY5wGZjKNnbiWDKubqxX8t.png","name":"Latvijas Televizija","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2025-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seeing Staburags","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5811323,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harijs Jaunzems","original_name":"Harijs Jaunzems","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6913b480595b54d1ff31c050","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2864058,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Uģis Kronbergs","original_name":"Uģis Kronbergs","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6913b3718ee8d331b8d262cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3130990,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Odita Krenberga","original_name":"Odita Krenberga","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6913b40208a6f1ef6631be2d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2885182,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gundars Rēders","original_name":"Gundars Rēders","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6913b415567ac822129c47da","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3131009,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Žanete Ostreiko","original_name":"Žanete Ostreiko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6913b42adec48a90c1d261ef","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5811316,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jānis Goldbergs","original_name":"Jānis Goldbergs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6913b43a95aa21afb7a0d3ca","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"lv","note":"","release_date":"2025-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
