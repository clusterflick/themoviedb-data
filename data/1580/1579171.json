The word Papashèi, a Lenape word meaning the way breathing moves the body while sleeping/dreaming opens the video. The work speaks to moira’s tactile memory, ancestral land and legacies of familial  refuge and disabilities connected to the wetlands. The installation version includes a touchscreen and VibraTech  that vibrates with the field recordings.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carrying Breath Between Ancestors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5811459,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"moira williams","original_name":"moira williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6913c81feb63fcbbcfd264e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
