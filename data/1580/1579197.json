The lone survivors are Ben Lee, his granddaughter Morning Glory and a young Mitchell boy who is given refuge by minister Dominie Jones. Fifteen years pass and Jack Winslow, a surveyor, comes to the valley and falls in love with Morning Glory. Their romance is opposed by Dave, a young half-wit who also loves Morning Glory and, out of jealousy, makes several attempts on Jack's life. When Jack is suspected of being the last surviving Mitchell, Morning Glory, acting in accordance with her family code of honor, shoots and wounds him. Soon after, Jones reappears and explains that Dave is the real Mitchell heir, thus clearing the path for Jack and Morning Glory's reconciliation.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/1UnubDT3IdmD6W4n7nDggkFbLSI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":120474,"logo_path":null,"name":"J.
