Hag battles society pressures, inner longings, and the tick of her own biological clock. She searches for love and meaning in a hellscape of waning fertility, dating apps and the rotten stench of the patriarchy. In this surreal South London, Hag's journey becomes mythical as her despair crystallises into a quest for answers, and she must face the ultimate test! In a world where being true to yourself makes you monstrous, what is the cost of compromise and repressing your authentic self?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/si86cwXiSphWCtF89VY2AqzQ33g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hag","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2114515,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Ginsburg","original_name":"Anna Ginsburg","popularity":0.0825,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691480875fb76ce1f8a0d789","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":800,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/si86cwXiSphWCtF89VY2AqzQ33g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":565}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
