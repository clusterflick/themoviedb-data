The inspiration of this stemmed from the medicalization of gender dysphoria by the ADA. This bred me to interact with the question of the intimate why’s behind this incongruence between sex and gender, whether gender dysphoria was inherent to transness, and analyze history and how America medicalizes trans people and specifically Black people. I wondered about our Black indigenous understandings of gender pre colonization and western ideals. This experimental documentary-film ultimately examines the technology of Black liberation and healing of trauma through vintage fashion, vintage aesthetics, and the romanization of nostalgia to create afro-futuristic utopias.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Echoes: The B Side","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
