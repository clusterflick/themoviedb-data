Aided by an expert friend and severely limited resources, this humorous production journal documents the chaotic, under-budget struggle to translate the original's complex themes of toxic masculinity and deep isolation into a short film. A critical reflection on the impossible ambition of capturing genius under pressure.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"stealing is one hell of a lesson.","title":"We Copied a Scorsese Film","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
