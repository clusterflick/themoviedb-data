This title expands on the popularity of animated talking-vehicle properties such as Theodore Tugboat and Thomas the Tank Engine by pairing real working boats with distinctive character voice-overs. Little Tug has been in dry dock all winter and cannot wait to get back in the water. He looks like a tugboat but actually does not have an engine powerful enough to perform true tug duties. Nevertheless, Little Tug has plenty of friends on the harbor among them Charlie the lobster boat (who speaks with a Maine accent), Thomas the paddle-wheel boat and Little Tugs best pal, Rita, a rather reckless speedboat. When Rita (running without a radio or a working fuel gauge) heads out of the small harbor to find big waves to play in, Little Tug loses track of her. His search for, and eventual heroic rescue of Rita leads him into the very busy New York harbor, south of Manhattan. Ages 2-6.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/oOgB4OHeuTSCwO1NeoU5y4Un8t6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":280306,"logo_path":null,"name":"Work A-Wake Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Journey of a small boat and his heroic day","title":"Little Tug's Big Adventure","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Pollock","original_name":"Mike Pollock","popularity":0.3406,"profile_path":"/qO84rNZ0HJHwwNcUlvizWkxVMeL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tug (voice)","credit_id":"6914ee80b82cc8c707dd3421","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oOgB4OHeuTSCwO1NeoU5y4Un8t6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1999-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
