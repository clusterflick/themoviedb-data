He's come back to pick up a script. She's there to meet her husband the playwright. As certain clues unfold onstage, they find themselves caught up in a web of lies and deceit. And someone may pay the ultimate price! Joker's Wild pays homage to film-noir, an 'Agatha Christie like' one act, a murder mystery that also has some fun referencing the post war classics.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Video Unavailable","title":"Joker's Wild","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4508856","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
