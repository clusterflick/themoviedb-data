An unknown brother makes himself known and Sofi realizes that the person she thought was her father is not at all. Sofi's newfound father Torbjörn turns out to have eight children and a retreat in India. While Sofi travels there, her mother Ann struggles with jealousy and guilt, and as a psychologist she tries to diagnose herself. Then follows a family drama where Ann, Sofi and Torbjörn clash and are forced to drill themselves into lies, denial and eventually perhaps even understanding. But what exactly is a lie? And can you miss a secret? In this dense documentary film by Viktor Nordenskiöld and Sofi Helleday, the viewer gets to witness up close the consequences of a 48-year-old secret for two families.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":2999,"logo_path":"/zGSqFee9aDgDuLD6vcs2mcJUem4.png","name":"SVT","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":115696,"logo_path":null,"name":"Freetownfilms AB","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":135560,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dixit International","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A secret","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":928023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofi Ahlström Helleday","original_name":"Sofi Ahlström Helleday","popularity":0.1284,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6914a2f33eb4570f659c4c38","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2260963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Viktor Nordenskiöld","original_name":"Viktor Nordenskiöld","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6914a336591b1bb437a0d799","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2260963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Viktor Nordenskiöld","original_name":"Viktor Nordenskiöld","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6914a34c526f9980699c4a2d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":928023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofi Ahlström Helleday","original_name":"Sofi Ahlström Helleday","popularity":0.1284,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6914a36ec91fc053addd2f84","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1073554,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Malcolm Dixelius","original_name":"Malcolm Dixelius","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":"/A2nUW5bFFAIySuzljwhHbEcMR4n.jpg","credit_id":"6914a37fc1daa774efc06cf8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33034085","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
