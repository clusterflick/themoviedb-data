This melancholy short was produced from offcuts captured during the NIETS IS VOOR DE EEUWIGHEID shoot. The factory has since been sadly demolished, but the short film functions not so much as a nostalgic afterthought or aesthetic urbexing avant-la-lettre, but rather a call to arms to use and work with all manner of beauty, however useless it might seem.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Farewell","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":232631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Digna Sinke","original_name":"Digna Sinke","popularity":0.0875,"profile_path":"/mKnawIrAwE6KetmN0tph4rW7RLl.jpg","credit_id":"69150f5787eb54ced231c255","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12759630","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
