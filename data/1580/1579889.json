He sells the family estate (Slánská hora) and announces a wild contest: whichever of his children becomes a parent first will inherit one million euros. His children and grandchildren — including a debt‑ridden restaurateur/MMA hopeful, a career‑focused singer granddaughter, and a gay grandson who longs for a family — launch into a frantic, absurd competition full of secrets, desperation and ambition. As the race unfolds, long‑buried tensions are exposed and the family learns what really matters: money or love and connection.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/209Zi4TwOfZymPWz3g0cNshGyLQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Million","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt38111150","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":"CZ","iso_639_1":"cs","file_path":"/209Zi4TwOfZymPWz3g0cNshGyLQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
