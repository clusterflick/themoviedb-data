Three teams from Wake Forest University could make history by being co-champions of the National Debate Tournament--or they could be upset in the prelims. These young people have spent half of their lives in this emotionally intense and intellectually vigorous activity. The National Debate Tournament is the culmination of all that work. College debate is a sensory marvel that stretches debaters to their physical limits as well. This isn't chess club. It's personal, often hinging on identity and race, so the stakes are high and the competitors are driven to be the best. The film follows the path of six debaters, their coaches, and the lives they have led, as they near the finale of a career at the highest level of competition.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ssIsbYmejUJUh6qKTH2f3FoqhXf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Think Hard, Talk Fast: The Drive to the National Debate Tournament","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2014898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"S.
