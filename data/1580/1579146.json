Acconci portrays Reagan as a ventriloquist's dummy, a two-dimensional puppet's head that is a mouthpiece for the ideology of the Right. Smiling like a TV evangelist or the host of a children's TV show, the Reagan puppet intones a litany of \"Family Values\" that is at once comic and chilling.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/22nj6UdxVwSv9Y4aLC2M3ohdv0n.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Election Tape '84","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1356017,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vito Acconci","original_name":"Vito Acconci","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":"/kF3zEReeQUwVaifuUaXNMniO1v8.jpg","credit_id":"6913bdaf1265c9afcad263d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/22nj6UdxVwSv9Y4aLC2M3ohdv0n.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
