By adhering to the biblical text yet acknowledging the multiplicity implied in “version,” the piece confronts the impossibility of pure transmission of divine meaning. Its motion-captured performance translates scripture into digital ritual, reflecting religion’s performative repetition rather than belief. The transformation of human movement into clay-rendered 3D data underscores both the futility and faithfulness of human attempts to reproduce the sacred, where visible imperfections become signs of humanity’s flawed mediation of a presumed perfect divine source.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"KING JAMES VERSION GENESIS CHAPTER NINETEEN","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1323426,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Sulzer","original_name":"Martin Sulzer","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6913d7ac6e28e62421875e49","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
