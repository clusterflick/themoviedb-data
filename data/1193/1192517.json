Meet Tony Flatman and Julian Meek, Wales's two most unlikely press barons. Four years ago they launched the Abertillery Dynamic, a free local newspaper, with the aim of holding power to account. Combining opinion pieces with regular features such as 'Sheep of the Week’ and 'The Pub Review’, this is no ordinary paper. After 36 editions, worn out and broke, they were forced to close down. But now they are back and ready to relaunch.  This wry, warm-hearted documentary celebrates these two lovable characters, as their old-fashioned approach to local journalism collides with the modern world.","popularity":0.0579,"poster_path":"/2StwqClvBwrIrpl3azN7WHxLr04.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Wales's quirkiest free newspaper gets a relaunch, if the editors can keep it together.","title":"The Dynamic Duo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4325149,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julian Meek","original_name":"Julian Meek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"652e80d0358da75b60a5dbe6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4325150,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Flatman","original_name":"Tony Flatman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"652e80dca80236011ac7797f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2819947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gwawr Loader","original_name":"Gwawr Loader","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":"/vrK7qvKLBmG4bEtgbV4J757NBrq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"652e8113ea84c7012d717431","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4325157,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Barnes","original_name":"David Barnes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652e8145ea84c7012d71745e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4325159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sebastian Bruno","original_name":"Sebastian Bruno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652e8157ea84c7014e06c49c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mlSXkfD7vJ6KwBGshOhdDFu0Q8l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2StwqClvBwrIrpl3azN7WHxLr04.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1332}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
