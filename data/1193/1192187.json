They looked them straight in the face. Some lost relatives, others lost their homes, their streets, their past, their memories. But Kharkiv residents still have the strength to fight. To gather to read poetry, to discuss writers, to sing lullabies. The main character Roman is a Kharkiv resident, who is madly in love with poetry. And he carries his love for it-sometimes senselessly, rightly, for no reason, like Don Quixote, like a madman, like a real Paper Knight.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1qfgJi4d4lWpl4fMBhY8tFTBbug.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140155,"logo_path":"/sK1dKpuXxuK5oXHbTCOzMWXDCcP.png","name":"Kyiv National I.
