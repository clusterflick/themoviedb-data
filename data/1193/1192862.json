On Aug. 29, 1941, Molètai residents, in partnership with Nazi officers, massacred the Jewish townspeople. These victims had been rounded up a few days earlier and locked inside the local synagogue without food or water. Around 2,000 Jews were then marched to the edge of the town and murdered. Locals dumped their bodies into a pit.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/kr2FT1qo1vtLGKjBZ4BNeGXVznj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Sunday in August","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8448558","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1414,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kr2FT1qo1vtLGKjBZ4BNeGXVznj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
