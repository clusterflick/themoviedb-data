This program follows El Niño’s deadly path through human history and the progress science has made in understanding the once-mysterious phenomenon. The effects of El Niño are presented in detail, including an 1878 outbreak of yellow fever in Tennessee, a concurrent drought that ravaged much of China, and more recent calamities that have brought the true nature of this climatic occurrence to light. Focusing on high-tech advances in meteorology, the video outlines El Niño’s significance in the global warming debate and illustrates the use of computer models that can predict its next appearance.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/r3QLoesLw71JhhX5VZAEgJC61zI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Life and Times of El Nino","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2033414","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r3QLoesLw71JhhX5VZAEgJC61zI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
