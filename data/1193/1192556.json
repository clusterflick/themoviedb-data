One of their twin sons, Schulke, disappears and is believed dead before they leave. After they settle into their new country, the family does well: the surviving twin, Nicholai, becomes a crusading District Attorney. One of the cases he is assigned to prosecute is that of small-time gangster Jacob Talinef, who has killed a former girlfriend of Nicholai's. Further investigation of the case, though, reveals a shocking secret.","popularity":0.3442,"poster_path":"/xjfGaC2U9l0FjEXyebVG9byqLEb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3245,"logo_path":"/9dBTQp9XitrHkx20i1r9HhZ3Q6B.png","name":"First National Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1928-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wheel of Chance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Barthelmess","original_name":"Richard Barthelmess","popularity":0.2591,"profile_path":"/p7nmZeuQjHOsNFgqgEXBdh78OSC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Nicolai Turkeltaub","credit_id":"652e9833a8023600fd2cf7d9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bodil Rosing","original_name":"Bodil Rosing","popularity":0.1743,"profile_path":"/rjaNRj7emocErFxh58ijWPP1OQs.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sara Turkeltaub","credit_id":"652e983fa8023600c315c60a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Warner Oland","original_name":"Warner Oland","popularity":0.3413,"profile_path":"/1WZmRVQsfjK8hwzbnaIy6WK41fr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mosher Turkeltaub","credit_id":"652e984aea84c7014e06cf4b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1173026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Schaefer","original_name":"Anne Schaefer","popularity":0.1035,"profile_path":"/9qRdeDOGNal4hgTZhWJ7OhLwMvG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Hanscha Talinef","credit_id":"652e985a358da75b60a5e78a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":932458,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lina Basquette","original_name":"Lina Basquette","popularity":0.1564,"profile_path":"/szYQFaO1tNTPAyRISDEti1sAQpO.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ada Berkowitz","credit_id":"652e9866024ec800e446cbea","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Livingston","original_name":"Margaret Livingston","popularity":0.1148,"profile_path":"/7yrbb5QRn6Jy0xRzyzYMer1sh2q.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Josie Drew","credit_id":"652e986fa8023600c315c62d","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89683,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alfred Santell","original_name":"Alfred Santell","popularity":0.1998,"profile_path":"/pehsZ5PMKALVUkur3PQfW3LMLbx.jpg","credit_id":"652e9879caef2d011cc6dd86","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1363919,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gerald C.
