The first stop is Spain, with sparkling ballet music by Manuel de Falla and Joaquín Rodrigo’s Concierto de Aranjuez, featuring star guitarist Pablo Sáinz-Villegas. There is a detour to South America with Heitor Villa-Lobos’s Bachianas brasileiras No. 4 and finally the Capriccio espagnol, in which Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov exudes a vibrant southern temperament with Russia colouring. As a tribute to Ludwig van Beethoven, the concert opens with the Leonore Overture No. 3.","popularity":0.0511,"poster_path":"/fmQeNRq7EzduP6w8wIj2cUO8sUg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"2020 New Year’s Eve Concert with Kirill Petrenko and Pablo Sáinz-Villegas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16341454","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1420,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gZzoBHImMoTr0na6QzLWLfxLvMY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2524}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":794,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fmQeNRq7EzduP6w8wIj2cUO8sUg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":529}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
