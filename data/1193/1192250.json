Karuna cannot get on the same page with Seema and believes that the whole process is “unnatural”. While their argument is interrupted, we see that the doctor, Dr. Arora, is having his own difficult conversation with his overbearing mom. As his new patient walks in, he can’t help but feel that she might be exactly what he was waiting for! He is not the only one. Karuna can’t help but fantasize about her daughter’s possible love story either. With a renewed agenda, Karuna is now totally onboard with Seema’s intention, except it will have to wait until Karuna finds out everything she needs to know about Dr. Arora.
