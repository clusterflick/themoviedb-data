It explores various instances of electronic noise, such as static and various interferences, as well as different interactions of analog synthesis and live digital processing, stemming from a single generator that is reflected both in the image and sound simultaneously. These elements are added and overlaid rhythmically, so that as time progresses, they form a cacophony that has an equal structure of order and chaos.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/6oVwOVDtcyowATt1UJRsV2hnmAY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2021-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Patrón de prueba 14: Interferencia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4323235,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Javier Plano","original_name":"Javier Plano","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652d3b9f024ec800aecccabb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6oVwOVDtcyowATt1UJRsV2hnmAY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB","release_date":"2021-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
