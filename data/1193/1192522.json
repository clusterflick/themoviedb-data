Vast and uncompromising, the scene presents a complex dialectic of destruction and regeneration. The landscape of markers, forces and traces looks utterly indifferentâ€”yet undeniably real. With an original score by Adrian K. Yee, Hope Slide progresses akin to a slow exhalation, evoking a contemplative melancholy of relief at a geological pace.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/wMpu2cpUZcVdnpMG21VRF3JZ7hY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hope Slide","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4325170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anthony Remizov","original_name":"Anthony Remizov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652e82cfcaef2d011cc6d094","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wMpu2cpUZcVdnpMG21VRF3JZ7hY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Antimatter [media art]","release_date":"2023-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
