Starving people ravenously eat donkeys and their weaker comrades. Frantic, raw, gripping, and cannibalistic western inspired by testimonies of the historical Great Famine of the 1930s. Ruthless Jupar with her two boys Jolan and Boshay runs for survival to reach her childhood village with hopes to find living relatives. A mother with no tears to cry endures rains, sandstorms, feverish famine, poisoned crops, hungry vultures, rotten meat, and greedy betrayals. Jupar will have to steal, cut throats, and protect her and others’ children to witness fates worse than death.","popularity":0.5911,"poster_path":"/3z6phasA7Vj2CmORuF73V2LC8zy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":225877,"logo_path":null,"name":"ArdFilm","origin_country":"KZ"},{"id":155132,"logo_path":"/9jPkwn3euKXzuQxJSgQOtiQNo7d.png","name":"Ministry of Culture and Sports of the Republic of Kazakhstan","origin_country":"KZ"},{"id":173578,"logo_path":"/pTyYwFYpihJmfuRkOJoUZPtloAD.png","name":"Kazakh Cinema","origin_country":"KZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","name":"Kazakhstan"}],"release_date":"2023-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kazakh","iso_639_1":"kk","name":"қазақ"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Land Where Winds Stood Still","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","title":"Zhel toqtaghan zher","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4326944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zhanar Shokpanova","original_name":"Zhanar Shokpanova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"652fe98fea84c700eba3f6ec","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4326945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salikh Beisenbai","original_name":"Salikh Beisenbai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"652fe997caef2d00c527fbc3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4326946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meirzhan Musakozha","original_name":"Meirzhan Musakozha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"652fe99ecaef2d011cc7a354","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4326948,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sagizbai Karabalin","original_name":"Sagizbai Karabalin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"652fe9a70cb33516f640f305","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4326949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ersin Kalybaeva","original_name":"Ersin Kalybaeva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"652fe9ae024ec8010154669b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1316747,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ardak Amirkulov","original_name":"Ardak Amirkulov","popularity":0.0891,"profile_path":"/sxR61kWVxipGpq8wXnJ30ETh1t0.jpg","credit_id":"652fe962caef2d011cc7a32c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1316747,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ardak Amirkulov","original_name":"Ardak Amirkulov","popularity":0.0891,"profile_path":"/sxR61kWVxipGpq8wXnJ30ETh1t0.jpg","credit_id":"652fe96c0cb33516feca1fde","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4206999,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Aleksandr Rubanov","original_name":"Aleksandr Rubanov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652fe977b09bde0100044785","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1316747,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ardak Amirkulov","original_name":"Ardak Amirkulov","popularity":0.0891,"profile_path":"/sxR61kWVxipGpq8wXnJ30ETh1t0.jpg","credit_id":"66ba716c2b2252fa11aae02d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30061599","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":"kk","file_path":"/3z6phasA7Vj2CmORuF73V2LC8zy.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":853},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zm9CfSrlCPSBWg81z813NkkVdAf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Black Nights Film Festival","release_date":"2023-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Lendoc Film Festival","release_date":"2024-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"THE LAND WHERE WINDS STOOD STILL I trailer 2023","key":"7Dk6g1W3wAU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-10-17T06:00:03.000Z","id":"656ec8a4568463010f846577"}]}}}
