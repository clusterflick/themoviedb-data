This animation is inspired by the story of a famous Chinese landscape painting Thousands Li of Rivers and Mountains, in which the artist adopted the lasting mineral pigment that created a striking blue and green landscape painting that remained unfaded for thousands of years. By viewing the historical transition from nature landscape to modern “concrete jungle” and the continuing impact of climate change, we collaborated with AI to create a journey based on a fusion of our concerns and AI memory.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/ejJWtniLPTIrRqkfkGVeIRrDv1G.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Faded Landscape","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4324917,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mingyong Cheng","original_name":"Mingyong Cheng","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652e5b38024ec800c775cc67","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ejJWtniLPTIrRqkfkGVeIRrDv1G.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aH2yS04qneHzEgMc1iiSQB87Btk.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Antimatter [media art]","release_date":"2023-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
