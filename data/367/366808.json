It is a visual exploration of physical artifacts, personal spaces and living memories where the image speaks for itself, recreating the impression of each artist whilst telling the story of Indian cinema. The film depicts the paradox of India’s relationship with cinema: the romance and the power, the neglect and the worship.","popularity":0.0687,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":17930,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dungarpur Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2015-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tamil","iso_639_1":"ta","name":"தமிழ்"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Immortals","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71092,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Avik Mukhopadhyay","original_name":"Avik Mukhopadhyay","popularity":0.0976,"profile_path":"/mh1NglYgTgFE1C7BRbpz5hNCqes.jpg","credit_id":"60e6c8fba3b5e600291a355e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1191719,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shivendra Singh Dungarpur","original_name":"Shivendra Singh Dungarpur","popularity":0.1124,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"563bc09c9251414c70004fd7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4986964","wikidata_id":"Q24521213","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
