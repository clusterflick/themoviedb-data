At 13, Romek Strzalkowski was the youngest victim of the first workers' rebellion against Communist authorities in Poland. During \"Black Thursday\" on June 26, he was killed protesting near the UB political police headquarters. Peter Mansfeld was the youngest victim of post-revolt Communist reprisals in Hungary. As a 15-year-old he took part in the Budapest fighting. After the revolution had been quelled by the Soviet army in 1956, he did not give up; he was arrested in 1959 and sentenced to death. Because of the Communists' cruelty, it took as long as 13 minutes for Peter to die, \"like Jesus Christ on the cross,\" said his Hungarian biographer. The filmmakers analyze the importance of the legend about the two boys who fought against Communism in Poland and Hungary.","popularity":0.6303,"poster_path":"/ykH1g0D4RMhu8OSgFSuu8IO8xlO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2008-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"13 Years, 13 Minutes","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1530992,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marek Maldis","original_name":"Marek Maldis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56383a1dc3a3681b5201e437","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2758770,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Grzegorz Lubczyk","original_name":"Grzegorz Lubczyk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f49b648d399e60033c8ab99","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2758771,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Krzysztof Kalukin","original_name":"Krzysztof Kalukin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f49b652a1a9ba003459301f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/ykH1g0D4RMhu8OSgFSuu8IO8xlO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":810,"name":"budapest, hungary"},{"id":208611,"name":"1950s"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Polish Film Festival in America","release_date":"2008-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":" Polish Film Festival Los Angeles","release_date":"2008-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
