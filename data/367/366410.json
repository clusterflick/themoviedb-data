On a shoestring budget, they bought an RV on the Internet for only $1,000 and planned the trip of a lifetime. They are starting their journey at the Oregon border and working their way down the coast to the Mexican border. Besides surfing an array of California beaches, they will also be trying new and exciting activities they discover along the way. This surf trip highlights the positive powers that surfing offers and shows how much fun surfing is at any skill level.","popularity":0.1912,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Amateur surfers put their lives on hold to surf at all 14 coastal counties in California, in only 14 days","title":"Crash The Coast","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1254001,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kyle Newacheck","original_name":"Kyle Newacheck","popularity":0.1411,"profile_path":"/2Um5p3KM9U3STRkt1OP4f7RAkjK.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Karl","credit_id":"5637d8b4925141285701daba","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1530937,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Haley Pikhart","original_name":"Haley Pikhart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64bb19d858efd30139529770","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1530937,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Haley Pikhart","original_name":"Haley Pikhart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64bb1af985c0a200e784ce86","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2383991,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Adam Newacheck","original_name":"Adam Newacheck","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/7P5YFUqoTNO80pm8AQDaxJICIxP.jpg","credit_id":"64bb197085c0a201060f23e2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1530937,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Haley Pikhart","original_name":"Haley Pikhart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64bb1a44fd4a9600c8ba5a10","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2383991,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Adam Newacheck","original_name":"Adam Newacheck","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/7P5YFUqoTNO80pm8AQDaxJICIxP.jpg","credit_id":"64bb1a32fd4a9600ae6461ba","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1254001,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kyle Newacheck","original_name":"Kyle Newacheck","popularity":0.1411,"profile_path":"/2Um5p3KM9U3STRkt1OP4f7RAkjK.jpg","credit_id":"64bb19bbe9da69012e0d23bc","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2383991,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Adam Newacheck","original_name":"Adam Newacheck","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/7P5YFUqoTNO80pm8AQDaxJICIxP.jpg","credit_id":"64bb1b0aeb79c200e28c824e","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1776140","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5349,"name":"surfing"},{"id":6075,"name":"sports"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
