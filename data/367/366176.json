It was once part of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy as the capital of the crown province of Bukowina. People of many different nationalities, languages, and cultures lived here together: Ukrainians, Romanians, Germans, Poles, Huzulians. Almost half of the population of Czernowitz, once amounting to 150,000 inhabitants, were Jews. The southern part of Bukowina is now part of Romania, the north, with Czernowitz/Chernivtsi, belongs to the Ukraine. Six years ago Volker Koepp made his film Herr Zwilling und Frau Zuckermann there. Dieses Jahr in Czernowitz returns there with emigrants and their descendants.","popularity":0.098,"poster_path":"/5LWA0Zkudf11DMvkXflUV2EXCj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2004-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"},{"english_name":"Yiddish","iso_639_1":"yi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Year in Czernowitz","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harvey Keitel","original_name":"Harvey Keitel","popularity":1.9649,"profile_path":"/7P30hza1neYWW3r7rSQOC736K2Z.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"594a1c5ac3a36861cb009b37","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1836739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Manea","original_name":"Norman Manea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"594a1c8fc3a368619b008709","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1047379,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Volker Koepp","original_name":"Volker Koepp","popularity":0.0801,"profile_path":"/f3Yb6zVCMsjIhncmcd10a9LvFdm.jpg","credit_id":"59393fcf9251410895010589","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1047379,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Volker Koepp","original_name":"Volker Koepp","popularity":0.0801,"profile_path":"/f3Yb6zVCMsjIhncmcd10a9LvFdm.jpg","credit_id":"59393fdcc3a368784c00f9cb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38196,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Thomas Plenert","original_name":"Thomas Plenert","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59393fe79251410880010c20","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1798441,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Angelika Arnold","original_name":"Angelika Arnold","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59393ff1c3a368784c00f9e1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0409894","wikidata_id":"Q50228141","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/5LWA0Zkudf11DMvkXflUV2EXCj.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":842,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/vVB8vxAadeL0wXwoUf7KDnhigOb.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":590}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-12-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
