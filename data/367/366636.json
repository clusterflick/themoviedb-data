Freedom for those who wish to live in a place where they are able to feel inspired. Dignity for the hotel owner to stand by his promise to his father and keep their mission alive: to provide an affordable sanctuary for artists and students in search of fulfilling employment, which they certainly won’t find at other hotels. Freedom, too, to be in an environment of tolerance and rid of prejudice. This film is not just a story about a mythical setting in Paris; it portrays the microcosm of a lifestyle in which collective values reign supreme. A film where what’s real and true is placed above national borders or cultural barriers.","popularity":0.2231,"poster_path":"/2YUJPjL3MSVGXuu6tMsfQ3qYv5T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92237,"logo_path":"/5JQrxwunQSSZWkichSKP4Jj2H0D.png","name":"Les Films
