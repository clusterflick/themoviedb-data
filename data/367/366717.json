Sir Howard Morrison (as himself) and Rotorua are the stars in the tiki-flavoured tale. Moving from Sydney to a Rotorua music festival the plot centres on a romance between a young drummer (Gary Wallace) and his girl Judy (Carmen Duncan) and the hurdles they face to stay true. But this is only an excuse for a melange of madcap, pep-filled musical fun. Made by John O’Shea’s Pacific Films, it features Kiri Te Kanawa, Lew Pryme and Aussie star Norman Rowe.","popularity":0.2379,"poster_path":"/2zgz8mi5UG6eyYvTcI8UFG1bPw2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22606,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pacific Films","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"1966-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don't Let It Get You","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Howard Morrison","original_name":"Howard Morrison","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"60a90be0e8131d0078aafe13","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3099425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gary Wallace","original_name":"Gary Wallace","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"60a90bf38dbc33005996feca","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":152489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmen Duncan","original_name":"Carmen Duncan","popularity":0.1777,"profile_path":"/nooIBAY2vQtTenez9HRp1d0Tyz0.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"60a90bfce8131d004198338e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2363912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Normie Rowe","original_name":"Normie Rowe","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/iFdB0sN3Zc1tEXZmmVYP7xPgOep.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"60a90c0366e4690043cc6ebc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1225312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kiri Te Kanawa","original_name":"Kiri Te Kanawa","popularity":0.2451,"profile_path":"/6AqPGMfsMrEwhqoNWEvJVL9Giij.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"60a90c088dbc3300282bda32","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2150797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Lavington","original_name":"Harry Lavington","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"60a90c0f501cf20026d3ee23","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3099426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alma Woods","original_name":"Alma Woods","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"60a90c150398ab0077c7c7d7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3099415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tanya Binning","original_name":"Tanya Binning","popularity":0.0671,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"60a90c1a7f2d4a002d7848aa","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3099427,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernie Leonard","original_name":"Ernie Leonard","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"","credit_id":"60a90c1f66e469007b3d446d","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3099428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Sharland","original_name":"Anne Sharland","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"","credit_id":"60a90c30e8131d005977ffeb","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3099429,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rim D.
