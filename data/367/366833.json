It tells the story of an old man, isolated from the outside world in a little mountain village in Ticino, Switzerland, who fights against oblivion. From books that he has there he cuts out texts and images about geology and geological history to fix and arrange them on the walls of his cottage. Frisch adds these articles to his novel to assemble human history with individual decay.","popularity":0.2788,"poster_path":"/5zOgx7zd633tYPbjiz1jxTfFQhS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1992-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Holocene","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erland Josephson","original_name":"Erland Josephson","popularity":0.2757,"profile_path":"/dopG1nAzyT23DMAPyPoUuwbZs4a.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Geiser","credit_id":"5ae1fa29c3a368767e0147a6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":236135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Duez","original_name":"Sophie Duez","popularity":0.2493,"profile_path":"/ahTZWv7inqyK2LN5P1Vo7w1wteE.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Corinne","credit_id":"5ae1fa34c3a368151d00fd50","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":965879,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manfred Eicher","original_name":"Manfred Eicher","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"563bda5ec3a3681b52025484","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1532040,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heinz Bütler","original_name":"Heinz Bütler","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"563bda479251416d52016c41","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1532040,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heinz Bütler","original_name":"Heinz Bütler","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae1f9b4c3a368767e01463e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64063,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Max Frisch","original_name":"Max Frisch","popularity":0.0769,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae1f9c90e0a262a6701201f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":38522,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Isabelle Dedieu","original_name":"Isabelle Dedieu","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae1f9fe92514124ca011839","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":965879,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manfred Eicher","original_name":"Manfred Eicher","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae1f9bc0e0a262a52013480","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20572,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Giorgos Arvanitis","original_name":"Γιώργος Αρβανίτης","popularity":0.2713,"profile_path":"/8h9SwFNVktZlnWah5jaVky2CwBV.jpg","credit_id":"5b07dfe7925141726a003ac7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0128255","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":824,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5zOgx7zd633tYPbjiz1jxTfFQhS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
