Everything about the family is completely normal, uncomfortably real: Their home, their jobs, her school, the way they hold and love each other. The line between fact and fiction is blurred because THEY ARE A REAL family. Until completely normal turns into what they fear the most. Alex's injury opens the door to a malevolent force that attacks and dismantles the family one person at a time: A violent aggressor determined to prove that possession is real, unconscionably disturbing and very different from how it's depicted in the movies.","popularity":0.6071,"poster_path":"/m9tz62H82NEcGzwUAX3pT0tmaUJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67294,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alexander Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2015-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Luciferous","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":14,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1532392,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mahsa Ghorbankarimi","original_name":"Mahsa Ghorbankarimi","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mahsa","credit_id":"563d15abc3a3681b4b025b0e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1532394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mina Gorelick","original_name":"Mina Gorelick","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Mina","credit_id":"563d15be92514129fe019ee7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1532393,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexander Gorelick","original_name":"Alexander Gorelick","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Alex","credit_id":"563d15ebc3a36862da000d84","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1604879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Schryer","original_name":"James Schryer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"John","credit_id":"570d2b0b92514139880000ed","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1532392,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mahsa Ghorbankarimi","original_name":"Mahsa Ghorbankarimi","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"563d1548c3a3681b4d02e898","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1532393,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexander Gorelick","original_name":"Alexander Gorelick","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"563d155f9251411867000227","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1532393,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexander Gorelick","original_name":"Alexander Gorelick","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"563d1570c3a3681b52027ecb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1532392,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mahsa Ghorbankarimi","original_name":"Mahsa Ghorbankarimi","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"563d158192514129fe019edf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3970874","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":5.06,"height":1360,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zyuDhaGRwjXQuDr66UJKIAtoctR.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":6882}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m9tz62H82NEcGzwUAX3pT0tmaUJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3350,"name":"poltergeist"},{"id":10224,"name":"haunting"},{"id":18035,"name":"family"},{"id":163053,"name":"found footage"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Luciferous Official Trailer","key":"fBVe-lMqTHY","published_at":"2015-11-02T20:08:44.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"563d16d8925141186700024b"}]}}}
