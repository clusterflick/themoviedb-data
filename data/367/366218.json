The opening scenes depicting the formation of the earth, and early marine life, employ such simple means of simulating movement as a moving camera and sliding cels and overlays. One primal, insect-like creature is pictured by means of an elaborate jointed cutout, its legs and antennae manipulated frame by frameâ€”a technique favored by some early animators. Most of the creatures in this film pose sedately before painted backdrops or simple settings; the effect is that of museum dioramas come to life.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/gxkm6YTCOmV5qUxs4vmk8TPZ6Nj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1925-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fifty Million Years Ago","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Fifty Million Years Ago","type":"Repackaged Version's title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3675770","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.514,"height":1764,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gxkm6YTCOmV5qUxs4vmk8TPZ6Nj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":906}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1925-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
