In the name of the Japanese emperor Hirohito, the desperate soldiers, enraged by intense Chinese resistance, stormed the then capitol of China and over a six week period systematically raped, tortured, and killed many of the inhabitants of that city. This is a matter-of-fact although polemical documentary, with many of the horrifyingly intense images taken from home movies made by an American missionary who was there.","popularity":0.0948,"poster_path":"/gxEHjOagB8CPRiaOfjd1ztGo6ew.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":133726,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film News Now Foundation","origin_country":""},{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1998-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In The Name of the Emperor","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1078024,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christine Choy","original_name":"Christine Choy","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":"/jW88Ds6UeYO8EzNhDkw2AQDdfC8.jpg","credit_id":"563ae65b9251414cc900332d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1078024,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christine Choy","original_name":"Christine Choy","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":"/jW88Ds6UeYO8EzNhDkw2AQDdfC8.jpg","credit_id":"563ae664c3a3681b4d0267e0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1538438,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nancy Tong","original_name":"Nancy Tong","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"564e5f159251414afd000d01","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0113411","wikidata_id":"Q130342777","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gxEHjOagB8CPRiaOfjd1ztGo6ew.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
