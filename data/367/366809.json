Hoffmann, the film investigates the tale's themes of obsession and madness, emphasizing expressionist imagery and theatrical style. The story relates the life of the young student Nathanael, whose childhood memories are haunted by a sinister  man. As a child, Nathanael believed this dark figure to be the mythic Sandman, who puts children to sleep by stealing their eyes. When confronted by this same evil presence as an adult, he is pushed toward madness as he tries to confront his childhood fears.","popularity":0.3943,"poster_path":"/r6NyjqqLKCXVLQmKrtTYTfJkig7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sandman","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christoph Waltz","original_name":"Christoph Waltz","popularity":2.5539,"profile_path":"/jMvLGCVXLaBqjRLf5olyvEucZob.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Nathanael","credit_id":"563bc102c3a3681b54026d8e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":36490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monika Baumgartner","original_name":"Monika Baumgartner","popularity":0.2884,"profile_path":"/eEeYi06CLbduje6RpKyQkP64L0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"563bc0f1c3a3681b5c027019","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominic Raacke","original_name":"Dominic Raacke","popularity":0.2224,"profile_path":"/iUlwSZnO9tHBKLPA84NpwcpkXT0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"563bc0fa92514129fe01718c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolf Schündler","original_name":"Rudolf Schündler","popularity":0.2334,"profile_path":"/pCMgzBPLU4CpAVckCiTkAjEM8ca.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"563bc10bc3a3681b59024868","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claus Eberth","original_name":"Claus Eberth","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/aZJtFLk8VcjgXCx54OZlK9ra59e.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"563bc118c3a3681b54026d92","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1166752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Felix von Manteuffel","original_name":"Felix von Manteuffel","popularity":0.1367,"profile_path":"/bThS31di24mh7sjAjSlK43vCGOj.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"563bc120c3a3681b4d02858d","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1087596,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dagmar Damek","original_name":"Dagmar Damek","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"563bc0e19251414c70004fdf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0086237","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.754,"height":890,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r6NyjqqLKCXVLQmKrtTYTfJkig7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":671},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5H9H88KLWTQUhuKN4uTPioIwUjA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
