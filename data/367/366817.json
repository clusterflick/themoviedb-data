The man, once convicted of the murder of a young woman, presents himself as reformed and suddenly plans to study theology and become a priest, for which he seeks the support of the Church. The clergyman Ralf Remberg (Devid Striesow) is then tasked with verifying the sincerity of Geissler's motives to determine whether the incarcerated man is genuinely serious about the matter. However, the more Remberg delves into the case, the more he begins to question his own faith.","popularity":0.4316,"poster_path":"/6KgY4qEH4lygPgPuLQEWWEAL0mf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2014-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Prediger","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lars Eidinger","original_name":"Lars Eidinger","popularity":0.505,"profile_path":"/u2La8Q3FfaFsMAw3YvvmAtMT95Y.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jan-Josef Geissler","credit_id":"563bca5b9251414c700050d5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Devid Striesow","original_name":"Devid Striesow","popularity":0.3552,"profile_path":"/dV5Sdfa7ED8gkbof8pWuBfPR7lo.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dr. Ralf Remberg","credit_id":"563bca6dc3a3681b4d028697","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Held","original_name":"Alexander Held","popularity":0.4981,"profile_path":"/zE9NoMX4657qMX52EMFah9pHYSI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Anwalt Dieter Dorn","credit_id":"563bca84c3a3681b54026ea3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1323355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline Ebner","original_name":"Caroline Ebner","popularity":0.0752,"profile_path":"/5ibhYGttjKpV8EAiEwU2mKN9eiS.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Christa Wagner","credit_id":"563bcae5925141781900259a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Götz Schubert","original_name":"Götz Schubert","popularity":0.471,"profile_path":"/rHeZ6L1XkBDHSdQS4Ilj8N0KQjg.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Pfarrer Klaus Spori","credit_id":"563bcaf3c3a3681b6102663b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erwin Steinhauer","original_name":"Erwin Steinhauer","popularity":0.1441,"profile_path":"/lEDs1d0uTu01uLdOpcw1EmmT2YS.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Bischof Blum","credit_id":"563bcb07c3a3681b4d0286a8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johannes Herrschmann","original_name":"Johannes Herrschmann","popularity":0.1045,"profile_path":"/8Ve17DoBkKGv5HlmonZga6LyUpA.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Franz Feininger","credit_id":"56ce2f52c3a368777c000203","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1324089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wiebke Puls","original_name":"Wiebke Puls","popularity":0.094,"profile_path":"/r3f8d5GWXzW6sfSRic6YWNfwBHu.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Dr. Meinhardt","credit_id":"5aeafcdd0e0a262b3f003340","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Berger","original_name":"Thomas Berger","popularity":0.0952,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"563bca4492514129fe017272","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3515622","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6KgY4qEH4lygPgPuLQEWWEAL0mf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":711}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
