Maurice dreams of becoming a violinist. But his father, a former boxing champion crippled by his bouts, has other dreams for his pudgy but strong 18 year old son. He wants Maurice to become the next Champ. Concerned about his son's lack of machismo, the father arranges a tryst between Maurice and Nora, an aging femme fatale. Unfortunately Nora's jealous husband suddenly interrupts their romantic interlude. Maurice accidently kills the husband in the ensuing scuffle. United by the tragedy, Nora and Maurice eventually fall in love. Maurice is then inspired to become a great fighter.","popularity":0.3089,"poster_path":"/mhdQAXF7CrZXRZNod1oocay6xSK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6849,"logo_path":"/AjdOGHRLAhWbP1aAga85A9EOfD2.png","name":"SFP","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":67161,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ultramarine","origin_country":""},{"id":67162,"logo_path":null,"name":"Diagonale","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1994-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wonderboy","video":false,"vote_average":3.833,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":144780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabienne Babe","original_name":"Fabienne Babe","popularity":0.1679,"profile_path":"/cOny64DetoolafEsbqinPxdTmIN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Nora Mouche","credit_id":"563b30199251414cc9003df3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1531855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Djob","original_name":"Sam Djob","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Maurice Maïeux","credit_id":"563b3021c3a3681b61025382","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":234156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kader Boukhanef","original_name":"Kader Boukhanef","popularity":0.1868,"profile_path":"/r8gikVXAQMoayrDvXgqoNE8TsrO.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Philippe Raclan","credit_id":"563b3029c3a3681b4b021e0f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rüdiger Vogler","original_name":"Rüdiger Vogler","popularity":0.2712,"profile_path":"/bW9FkPAZ1HnzxmlLsXNIgOyTQ0O.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Rudy Faraguss","credit_id":"563b30319251416d520159a6","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Vecchiali","original_name":"Paul Vecchiali","popularity":0.1797,"profile_path":"/asmAmxUh09s7mNbFXWuAaEossPX.jpg","credit_id":"563b2fdc9251416d52015992","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Vecchiali","original_name":"Paul Vecchiali","popularity":0.1797,"profile_path":"/asmAmxUh09s7mNbFXWuAaEossPX.jpg","credit_id":"563b2fe9c3a3681b59023759","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1531853,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frederick Leroy","original_name":"Frederick Leroy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"563b2ff7c3a3681b4b021e03","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Vecchiali","original_name":"Paul Vecchiali","popularity":0.1797,"profile_path":"/asmAmxUh09s7mNbFXWuAaEossPX.jpg","credit_id":"63c906c7abdec000ae24d814","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168418,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Georges Strouvé","original_name":"Georges Strouvé","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c906d2142ef1008a5443f2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Vecchiali","original_name":"Paul Vecchiali","popularity":0.1797,"profile_path":"/asmAmxUh09s7mNbFXWuAaEossPX.jpg","credit_id":"63c906d8abdec0007dd66cc1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60401,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Phillip B.
