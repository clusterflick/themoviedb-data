Pet Memorial Park. Naming the fryer Blinky, Vallance transformed poultry into pet, paying tribute to the billions of hens sacrificed each year for our consumption. Ten years later questions of the true cause of Blinky’s death continue to swirl. Blinky, the videotape, documents the search for this cause. Alas, like the shroud of Turin, Blinky’s death cannot be completely resolved. Blinky’s ten-year story ends where it began, in our culture’s glistening, dreamlike symbol of heavenly closure, the supermarket.","popularity":0.0902,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blinky","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1407074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Yonemoto","original_name":"Bruce Yonemoto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"563845d392514129fe010c3b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1154811,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norman Yonemoto","original_name":"Norman Yonemoto","popularity":1.22,"profile_path":"/jD3I91Y7TiA3t2PA9OIJeK0QGBM.jpg","credit_id":"563845e2c3a3681b5c0207f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
