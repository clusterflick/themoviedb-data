Felico, a hockey champ in a wheelchair, Kraian, a school teacher fond of S &amp; M, Federicona, a romantic fifty year old transsexual that works in the streets, still in love with the man with whom she was engaged to twenty years ago. These are just some of the stories that intersect in this living fresco: 'Pan Play Decadence' is a film in the making, a document of a contemporary world, ranging from little-known instances of collective and individual needs, the search for touching paths of intimate salvation.","popularity":0.0667,"poster_path":"/9K0Znd5TbsKw2ZINWK4P6be6P9R.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pan
