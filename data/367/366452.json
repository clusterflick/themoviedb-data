This subject matter was banned in Communist Poland for political reasons; it was only in the 1990s that Polish historians began analyzing it. \"Polish\" Georgians, loyal to the country that had accepted them, proved their heroism during the September 1939 defense campaign and later in occupied Poland and on the western fronts. Many later received the most prestigious Polish military distinctions. Numerous Georgian officers became involved in all spheres of life in their new motherland, marrying Polish women and brought up their children in the atmosphere of pride and remembrance of a heroic fight for the freedom of both nations.","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wearing A Four-Cornered Cap And A Tiger Skin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1530991,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jerzy Lubach","original_name":"Jerzy Lubach","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5638395dc3a3681b5c020669","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4295840","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
