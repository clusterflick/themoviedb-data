Nara-Nara, a Japanese detective, is assigned to the case because his country has guaranteed safety to these transport ships. Nara-Nara believes that Northfield is guilty, although in reality it is Northfield's secretary Kitty Little, a girl of German ancestry, who is passing information to Dr. Ebell Smith, a German agent. Nara-Nara falls in love with Kitty, but soon after discovers that she is the leak in the quartermaster's office.","popularity":0.4821,"poster_path":"/eLfjWeLmNKEtfiMqe5OwGq2MWJ0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29749,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jesse L.
