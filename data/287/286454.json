The main figure is Zilahy Kálmán, a high-school teacher, very much attracted to Ady's ideology. He is, at the same time, a rational minded sober character keeping a certain distance from the chaotic events. During the first months of the terror of the Whites, he takes a stand for his persecuted colleague, and with his wife's help, he hides Pálos, a Communist commissar in his flat.","popularity":0.1469,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7013,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hunnia Filmstúdió","origin_country":"HU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1973-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fallow Land","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56292,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoltán Latinovits","original_name":"Zoltán Latinovits","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":"/pA2Mc0pUzrRR4HxLQN7R1F0Xzsh.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Zihaly Kálmán - Tanár","credit_id":"53ea3c02c3a3680ec70010f3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":586245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sándor Horváth","original_name":"Sándor Horváth","popularity":0.055,"profile_path":"/1L7Lg2NQPvma356DXqyffBoBUpZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Pálos Endre","credit_id":"53ea3c0dc3a3680ec70010f6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1090507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Drahota","original_name":"Andrea Drahota","popularity":0.1375,"profile_path":"/mDSSPt4or3YCHMNuCbBimfmqa4n.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Zihaly Andrea - Fotós","credit_id":"53ea3c18c3a3680eb50010ba","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1132942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"László Mensáros","original_name":"László Mensáros","popularity":0.0656,"profile_path":"/eAzdvEpOEgnDperuOK8Nsy1UPs0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sághy- Igazgató","credit_id":"53ea3c21c3a3680ebd00105e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125192,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antal Páger","original_name":"Antal Páger","popularity":0.0919,"profile_path":"/pCpU9AUtJbaNxbMDbHjSnZoesYn.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Bíró","credit_id":"53ea3c2cc3a3680ec70010f9","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149362,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"András Kovács","original_name":"András Kovács","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/z47YieDeJtQkMKFxXNCQy09H4vb.jpg","credit_id":"53ea3c3ac3a3680ec70010fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149362,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"András Kovács","original_name":"András Kovács","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/z47YieDeJtQkMKFxXNCQy09H4vb.jpg","credit_id":"53ea3c47c3a3680eb9001045","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":233720,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Éva Kármentő","original_name":"Éva Kármentő","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53ea3c68c3a3680eb50010bc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56290,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"György Illés","original_name":"György Illés","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":"/9e90VKt94prZ8ObBBLfMQUjMayQ.jpg","credit_id":"58fea719c3a3685331001237","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1352509,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andor Kovács","original_name":"Andor Kovács","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58fea723c3a36853520010cb","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":56306,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Tamás Vayer","original_name":"Tamás Vayer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58fea736c3a36852ed0011df","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1803258,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"András Földes","original_name":"András Földes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58fea73e92514107c60011a9","department":"Art","job":"Set Decoration"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1803259,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Boldizsár Simonka","original_name":"Boldizsár Simonka","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58fea74b92514107db00127f","department":"Art","job":"Set Decoration"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1603108,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Erzsébet Mialkovszky","original_name":"Erzsébet Mialkovszky","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58fea753c3a368533100125e","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0068898","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
