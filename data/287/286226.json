When he is killed, she is left destitute and attaches herself to Sir Marcus Ordeyne and begs his protection. He takes her home out of pity, and her charm and innocence cause him to fall in love with her. When he plans to marry her, Judith Mainwaring, who looks upon Carlotta as a rival, tells her he merely pities her and is marrying her to avoid a scandal. Carlotta runs away with Pasquale, a friend of Sir Marcus, though she loves her guardian. Later, Mrs. Mainwaring meets Carlotta in Paris and tells the girl the truth--that Sir Marcus is searching for her. Realizing his love for her, Carlotta is reunited with her benefactor.","popularity":0.2376,"poster_path":"/AvisPnpOHEo2bpuSSByKnHKg3LI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1921-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Morals","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"May McAvoy","original_name":"May McAvoy","popularity":0.1527,"profile_path":"/r1twk0uEppt3dhuZqi4Zx7Nq0NP.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Carlotta \tCarlotta","credit_id":"53e7fce90e0a266fa1002c31","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William P.
