The words, melody, and interpretation of this song fills my eyes with tears when I hear it...the disc is worth it for this number alone.  -Alejandra Vernon","popularity":1.1204,"poster_path":"/kSdcqFH91KzqcUumjKzUESrxteR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16305,"logo_path":null,"name":"Premier Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The top Holiday songs by the Gaithers and friends.","title":"Christmas a Time for Joy","video":true,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Bill and Gloria Gaither and Their Homecoming Friends: Christmas a Time for Joy","type":"Alt"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":974362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Gaither","original_name":"Bill Gaither","popularity":0.3835,"profile_path":"/ciC6nhZjAMfAg9YfVZ9f4kM2YVM.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"53e664b40e0a2628d50021d0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":974363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gloria Gaither","original_name":"Gloria Gaither","popularity":0.2318,"profile_path":"/c1oSwworwRY2ihYgCYibr26FnFe.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"53e664bc0e0a2628d50021d2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1077260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Lowry","original_name":"Mark Lowry","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/jNqwQTlAPCZJf7xLQjOHuNBhWVb.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"53e664c30e0a2628c7002046","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1077935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Phelps","original_name":"David Phelps","popularity":0.2065,"profile_path":"/lpuvtW3S4d6ZrqFCciecCObkrxI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"53e664cb0e0a2628db0020b6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1024163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vestal Goodman","original_name":"Vestal Goodman","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/jWBnDcoa2DMjDmoKz1EEVbZCefF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"53e664d20e0a2628d50021d6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1077261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy Penrod","original_name":"Guy Penrod","popularity":0.2802,"profile_path":"/pE7v2AocUfp1p8Mcg43o3G1KOzy.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"53e664d70e0a2628ce0021fa","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1077262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luke Renner","original_name":"Luke Renner","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53e664f60e0a2628ce0021fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":974363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gloria Gaither","original_name":"Gloria Gaither","popularity":0.2318,"profile_path":"/c1oSwworwRY2ihYgCYibr26FnFe.jpg","credit_id":"53e665000e0a2628cb00209f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":974362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Gaither","original_name":"Bill Gaither","popularity":0.3835,"profile_path":"/ciC6nhZjAMfAg9YfVZ9f4kM2YVM.jpg","credit_id":"53e665080e0a2628d100225f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2940,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kSdcqFH91KzqcUumjKzUESrxteR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18035,"name":"family"},{"id":156064,"name":"homecoming"},{"id":191541,"name":"gaither"},{"id":206271,"name":"southern gospel"},{"id":207317,"name":"christmas"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bill & Gloria Gaither - O Holy Night [Live] ft.
