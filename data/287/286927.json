I believe that each one has the right to see the society he lives in with his own particular view. I am, personally, more interested in Devil than God”- Elias Petropoulos. A restless and inquisitive spirit, a foe of academics and the status-quo, Petropoulos was the first folklorist in Greece, who dealt with social outcasts and described people and situations ignored by his country’s official history. Petropoulos takes us on a journey to unknown landscapes of our tradition and Greek-ness and acquaints us with all those people who belong to our social underground and who dominate his books. Rebetika musicians, bums, spivs, whores and homosexuals, people tormented and Greek-ness and acquaints us with all those people who belong to our social underground.","popularity":0.1042,"poster_path":"/9pnrkk2ym7GuWvc9CfErsHV6pPD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76872,"logo_path":null,"name":"Portolanos
