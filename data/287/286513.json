Everybody is celebrating the 600th birthday of the local hero, Otto the Ironman, who in his time saved the duchy from annexation and beat the enemy so badly, that he fled ... well, that’s what it says in the history books, at least.  Local gossip asserts, however, that Otto wasn’t even part of the battle and was spending his time having fun with a pretty girl.  When one day a piece is introduced at the court theatre, which tells the heroic story of Otto, the director rejects the mediocre story.","popularity":0.1226,"poster_path":"/4YcEbl3pZFVL4h0DtJVTT9gVstn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15730,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bavaria-Filmkunst","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1942-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kleine Residenz","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lil Dagover","original_name":"Lil Dagover","popularity":0.2715,"profile_path":"/eNdCKI0PjnDapWEbTuZln7U2hCl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Herzogin von Lauffenburg","credit_id":"53ea85d00e0a26074e0000f8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johannes Riemann","original_name":"Johannes Riemann","popularity":0.2316,"profile_path":"/46LG5vuLB9TZ3ltgu0Oo6MtCUfI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Freiherr von Luck","credit_id":"53ea85e30e0a26073c000115","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1067627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Winnie Markus","original_name":"Winnie Markus","popularity":0.0816,"profile_path":"/iJuEW7v6d6jJbZ7Io2JOjdAoOy4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Marianne Hartung","credit_id":"53ea85f50e0a26073900011e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fritz Odemar","original_name":"Fritz Odemar","popularity":0.2029,"profile_path":"/t2GaB9HL3LKbEqH0lCyfIgiwrip.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Herzog von Lauffenburg","credit_id":"53ea86050e0a260748000120","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gustav Waldau","original_name":"Gustav Waldau","popularity":0.1054,"profile_path":"/qNucFeS8EtlbSxsQOoUWgpn06Im.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Professor Schmittchen","credit_id":"53ea86160e0a26073f000128","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margarete Haagen","original_name":"Margarete Haagen","popularity":0.2028,"profile_path":"/vTjwPXwDxEtB1zFHKTnT5cTEHZF.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Tante der Herzogin","credit_id":"53ea86260e0a26074b000108","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ulrich Beiger","original_name":"Ulrich Beiger","popularity":0.3051,"profile_path":"/idnBq1xDnWjM6YDJpTZnHfSPfRj.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Möller","credit_id":"53ea86360e0a260748000122","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Wery","original_name":"Carl Wery","popularity":0.1778,"profile_path":"/dSdawnhuEKtbrKd15OAMw2YWEzf.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Dr. Werner","credit_id":"53ea86480e0a260742000138","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1770882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Buhse","original_name":"Walter Buhse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Fresco","credit_id":"58bd492ec3a36866a50495b0","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willem Holsboer","original_name":"Willem Holsboer","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Lampe","credit_id":"58bd493cc3a3680d6800064e","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":49294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wastl Witt","original_name":"Wastl Witt","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Frimmel","credit_id":"58bd494a925141126a03064a","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1740406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Werner Nippen","original_name":"Werner Nippen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Mattes","credit_id":"58bd4959c3a368668f041dd6","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33079,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josef Eichheim","original_name":"Josef Eichheim","popularity":0.1799,"profile_path":"/lXt1MWiAQKZJuDUk2vLy7cWXj5G.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Inspizient","credit_id":"58bd4970925141126a03065f","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":33083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Otto Brüggemann","original_name":"Otto Brüggemann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Flemming","credit_id":"58bd497fc3a3680db10007c8","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1352495,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Wagner","original_name":"Paul Wagner","popularity":0.0386,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Pfundhammer","credit_id":"58bd4995c3a3686630047703","order":14}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans H.
