One evening, while strolling through the subdivision painted up as his alter ego Shadow Zombie, Kim catches the eye of a registered nurse and part-time clown Brandi. What follows is a brief romance marked by destruction by the very real phantoms emanating from Kim's dead-end present and Brandi's traumatic past. Shooting under near-documentary conditions in and around Lafayette, Louisiana, Jorge Torres-Torres operates peopling his film with a coterie of genuine Acadiana misfits. The merciless and at times unexpectedly poignant observation of Kim's world dares to see through to the human core of a drug addict or clinically depressed clown.","popularity":0.3481,"poster_path":"/raS6W2hQVcEannGjKuqFnBJlwra.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29613,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blackout Films","origin_country":""},{"id":29614,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cantina Filmworks","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Meet Kim Filth and enter his horror film existence...","title":"Shadow Zombie","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1351975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Filth","original_name":"Kim Filth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Kim","credit_id":"53e7f52a0e0a266f94002b96","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1351974,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Sally Smith","original_name":"Sally Smith","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53e7f4ed0e0a266f9a002aa1","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1141880,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Torres-Torres","original_name":"Jorge Torres-Torres","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53e7f4710e0a266f94002b83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1141880,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Torres-Torres","original_name":"Jorge Torres-Torres","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53e7f4980e0a266f8d002bb7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1351973,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Neil Edward Benjamin","original_name":"Neil Edward Benjamin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53e7f4cec3a3683999002345","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2891774","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/raS6W2hQVcEannGjKuqFnBJlwra.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":531,"name":"southern usa"},{"id":9872,"name":"grief"},{"id":14964,"name":"drugs"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"SHADOW ZOMBIE trailer 1","key":"qZHKv1bIEHY","published_at":"2014-04-09T16:08:00.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"53e7f67f0e0a266fa5002b49"}]}}}
