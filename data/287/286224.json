But as this intimate film reveals, his work is suffused with the trauma of migration, and the struggle to recognise himself as a â€˜new Australian'. In conversation with documentarian Steven McIntyre, Dirk guides us through more than 40 years of his filmmaking: the early years exploring technique and technology, a subsequent phase of unflinching self-examination brought on by upheaval and overseas travel, and more recent projects where he attempts a fusion of personal, cultural, and historical identity. What emerges is an inspiring, rugged, and at times poignant portrait of an artist committed to self-expression and self-discovery through the medium of film.","popularity":0.104,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":29615,"logo_path":null,"name":"Urni Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2014-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The first retrospective examination of filmmaker Dirk de Bruyn's prolific and prodigious career.","title":"The House That Eye Live In","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1351976,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dirk de Bruyn","original_name":"Dirk de Bruyn","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/bnvs5MAoCf29KzNdw2RRWSKSXz8.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"53e7f9d60e0a266f94002bea","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1351977,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven McIntyre","original_name":"Steven McIntyre","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53e7fa0a0e0a266f97002acd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3861628","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":15126,"name":"historical"},{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
