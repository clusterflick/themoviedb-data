Reimers doesn’t understand the reason for this and since she won’t say a word as to why she’s quit, he asks her to spend the evening with him and his son Konrad.  Konrad, however, wanted to take advantage of the holiday to bring his divorced parents back together and sends Angelika packing as soon as she reaches the house.  Disappointed and sad, she drives to the airport to meet Captain van Santen, who also invited her to spend the holiday.","popularity":0.4036,"poster_path":"/9VNIRarrYSaB0CjZyFgjsKvmAAj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1704,"logo_path":"/sb3PuMTgJgpPUY7x634etBAhodu.png","name":"Bavaria Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1939-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Irrtum des Herzens","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Der 24.
