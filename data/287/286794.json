Based on interviews with eye witnesses and years of dedicated research, this film dramatisation explores the possibility that Hitler didn't die in Germany at the end of the war, but instead escaped from Berlin by air and made his way to Argentina. This is the gripping story of what might have happened; the CIA s possible involvement, his life in Patagonia, the escape routes and the astonishing fact that Hitler may have had two daughters.","popularity":0.2681,"poster_path":"/jV13UtumQXkTGg8pfJZfitqVkHI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168351,"logo_path":null,"name":"Grey Wolf Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":168352,"logo_path":null,"name":"Magnumhold","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Case Presented...","title":"Grey Wolf: The Escape of Adolf Hitler","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Grey Wolf: Hitler's Escape to Argentina","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dante Venesio","original_name":"Dante Venesio","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Adolf Hitler","credit_id":"61eae0d39c97bd0091d41de1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3391906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Heller","original_name":"Maria Heller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Eva Braun","credit_id":"61eae0e89c97bd0044928763","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3391909,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gerard Williams","original_name":"Gerard Williams","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61eae1169ca7590045b2b582","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2493402","wikidata_id":"Q22947477","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xRohX8Pn9iaYxUOkGenmsJ1jcZy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bBegMbFFw0L20ar3UjJQcsWaIoV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wDsZ5UfS8derzVjknMwUUNg93qV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5xixD12VfhWoeV63MoW3GwcC0H0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"sv","file_path":"/vtcJPHXqAcYgGCqDF3BjnGLUQrx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jV13UtumQXkTGg8pfJZfitqVkHI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jmHjMXlVq3XuJ2D200z1tccqL8O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1326,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qBfTIyhhjIH8oQPSmCtfyCzjuy4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":884},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/l9Xp6qKNlHGmLZHw5mrVqWsQ9F5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5ZC2QUcancAgC6YmOFeIcfQCOfh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Grey Wolf  The Escape of Adolf Hitler Trailer","key":"5KYOhyu6NYc","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2023-03-30T16:02:23.000Z","id":"65d92efb0f0da50185325738"}]}}}
