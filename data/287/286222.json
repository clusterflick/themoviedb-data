While the theme of THE FARM was \"to err is human, to forgive divine\", we now delve more deeply and find hope for \"reconciliation and release\". Angola is America's oldest and largest prison, with 5,000 inmates, most of whom have received life -, or death-, sentences for violent crimes, and will never leave Angola. THE FARM continues to provide extraordinary opportunities for learning through storytelling.","popularity":0.0726,"poster_path":"/iXtO3tVzKPPIaoSuNtunBPFX0th.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":248436,"logo_path":null,"name":"Highest Common Denominator Media Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Farm: 10 Down","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Το αγρόκτημα: 10 χρόνια μετά","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1018696,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sean Vaughn","original_name":"Sean Vaughn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"676da62441419aa85092891c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":224846,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Stack","original_name":"Jonathan Stack","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd19487b76cbb00137c49b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":224846,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Stack","original_name":"Jonathan Stack","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676da578bf10ff1984614e37","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":224846,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Stack","original_name":"Jonathan Stack","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676da5c4d0b08f97186146de","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1141561,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nancy Novack","original_name":"Nancy Novack","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676da5e28258294bb8614e17","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1141561,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nancy Novack","original_name":"Nancy Novack","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676da5f662ba310fc0129bb9","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1305584","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":998,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iXtO3tVzKPPIaoSuNtunBPFX0th.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":378,"name":"prison"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2009-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"THE FARM: 10 DOWN - Trailer","key":"u_FXZ_Lqyyc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-03-10T17:37:54.000Z","id":"676da51c62ba310fc0129b1f"}]}}}
