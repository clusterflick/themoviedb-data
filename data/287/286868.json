Warner Bros.' Captain Thunder contains some of the darndest Mexican accents you've ever heard in your life.  The star is Hungarian-born Victor Varconi, portraying a legendary south of the border outlaw who tries to force Canadian senorita Fay Wray to marry a rival rustler whom she despises.  She pleads with the bandito so pathetically that he is moved to grant her a single wish.  Without hesitation she chooses her poor but true love. The bandit king, being a somewhat honorable fellow grants the wish and without a twitch, guns down the wicked cattle thief.  Fortunately the film was played for comedy, a wise decision since it probably would have garnered laughs as a straight drama anyway.","popularity":0.6958,"poster_path":"/5TVzRhh7jqwVweZCPjQBXAZgQ5d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9329,"logo_path":"/aue5pVfj9TcjYEOufkcuCbAL5hE.png","name":"The Vitaphone Corporation","origin_country":"US"},{"id":174,"logo_path":"/zhD3hhtKB5qyv7ZeL4uLpNxgMVU.png","name":"Warner Bros.
