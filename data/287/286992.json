In desperation he runs away to catch up with his only friend; a fisherman. While fishing he is he is confronted by a huge crocodile who demands fish in exchange for something more precious than food! After parting with the fish, the crocodile gives him three secret and wise sayings. He runs back to school, and twenty years later the boy has grown up to be a highly successful political leader. When asked what the secret of his success has been, he delivers the three wise saying with great oratory skills. As he concludes his voice turns into the crocodiles voice of long ago.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/7p91BWZoLa3GrV263LVyWCiHa0g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30080,"logo_path":null,"name":"A Change the World Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TL","name":"Timor-Leste"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chau'u Polo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Romendio Hornay","original_name":"Romendio Hornay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Chau'u Polo","credit_id":"53eed2cd0e0a2675b800080e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zelindo Joao Lay","original_name":"Zelindo Joao Lay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Chau'u Polo as an adult","credit_id":"53eed2e70e0a2675b8000815","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edy May Chailor-Peskador","original_name":"Edy May Chailor-Peskador","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Fisherman","credit_id":"53eed2f60e0a2675bf000849","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nivio Meleve Guerra de Olivera","original_name":"Nivio Meleve Guerra de Olivera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Voice of crocodile (voice)","credit_id":"53eed3090e0a2675bf00084f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abo Lafaek","original_name":"Abo Lafaek","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"53eed979c3a3685ae200057d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353401,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wayne Tindall","original_name":"Wayne Tindall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53eed2820e0a2675b2000828","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353402,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Meluk","original_name":"Charles Meluk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53eed28a0e0a2675bc0007d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353403,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nofiana Da Cruz","original_name":"Nofiana Da Cruz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53eed2a60e0a2675b50007dc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353401,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wayne Tindall","original_name":"Wayne Tindall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6192c8e1223a8b0060b78c8f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2561483,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Danny da Silva Lopes","original_name":"Danny da Silva Lopes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6192c8fb6ca9a00094166855","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3311003,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anne Tindall","original_name":"Anne Tindall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6192c9096ca9a0009416685f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353401,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wayne Tindall","original_name":"Wayne Tindall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6192c8eb6ca9a000672ed342","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3175446","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7p91BWZoLa3GrV263LVyWCiHa0g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
