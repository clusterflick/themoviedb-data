Three tiny castaway islands rise away from the coast of French Guyana, in South America: The Devil's Islands. Now buried under an impenetrable jungle, lay the lost remains of what had been for a hundred years the most storied convict prison in history. There, while most of the prisoners faded into oblivion, a few became legends. Some because they were innocent, as in the scandalous Dreyfus Affair, some because they somehow escaped the islands of nightmare, as did the \"butterfly\", Henry Charrière, immortalized by Steve McQueen in Papillon. Now 50 years after the prison doors slammed shut for the last time, we explore what's left of the Devil's Islands' unbelievably dark and oppressive realm.","popularity":0.8755,"poster_path":"/r9TRTfuhHnZuyJGA13ozvR1n9Th.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77449,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jules Verne Adventures Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2001-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Devil's Island: Journey Into Jungle Alcatraz","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Lee","original_name":"Christopher Lee","popularity":2.2688,"profile_path":"/4zPu5YaRPbhrcp9aVjXQDjpfwPC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6128ccc912197e008b7256da","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213902,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Claude Rives","original_name":"Claude Rives","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6128ce972c6b7b004354df0d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213901,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Philippe Cupilard","original_name":"Philippe Cupilard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6128ce83957ce50029926c6b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1135255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Christophe Jeauffre","original_name":"Jean-Christophe Jeauffre","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6128ce22e04aca0023499cb4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213903,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dimitri Billecocq","original_name":"Dimitri Billecocq","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6128ceb51bf8760042150309","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1135255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Christophe Jeauffre","original_name":"Jean-Christophe Jeauffre","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6128ce330d9f5a002c51e9c4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":237932,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frederic Dieudonné","original_name":"Frederic Dieudonné","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6128ce54373ac2006836a649","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1135255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Christophe Jeauffre","original_name":"Jean-Christophe Jeauffre","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6128ce1781140f004323f6a7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1135255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Christophe Jeauffre","original_name":"Jean-Christophe Jeauffre","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6128ce0a1bf87600421502a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213900,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Thierry Anne","original_name":"Thierry Anne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6128ce715ed962004507b51c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29056,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Scott","original_name":"John Scott","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6128cee481140f008b788c5b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3213909,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Cyrille Charreaux","original_name":"Cyrille Charreaux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6128cefb373ac2002a8e5282","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":237932,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frederic Dieudonné","original_name":"Frederic Dieudonné","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6128ce4b0d9f5a0043da4f2a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1291586","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vQeudUuD0JSsrkHWTQ9rP04Zn0F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/r9TRTfuhHnZuyJGA13ozvR1n9Th.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":378,"name":"prison"},{"id":10787,"name":"jungle"},{"id":191047,"name":"prison break"},{"id":232141,"name":"french guiana"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
