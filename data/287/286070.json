But first, he wants to visit his uncle, Pastor Hoppe, in the small village of Rosenau.  It's here that he again meets his cousin and childhood friend Annie. Annie is the illegitimate child of Pastor Hoppe's sister, who's left the upbringing of her offspring to the man-of-the-cloth.  Conservative chaplain Schigorski continually tries to convince Annie to join the nearby cloister and thus \"atone\" for the sins of her mother. And it's getting more difficult for the fun-loving girl to escape the chaplain's harrassment. When Hans arrives, old feelings of lust come back to the surface.","popularity":0.1858,"poster_path":"/3528LuHyhgYYTf4Wlxflou3rxxN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7448,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tobis Filmkunst","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1938-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jugend","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":55762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristina Söderbaum","original_name":"Kristina Söderbaum","popularity":0.1288,"profile_path":"/yhrxZh69mpoiGLF9Run573y44PQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ännchen","credit_id":"53e6d1ec0e0a266fa5000718","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugen Klöpfer","original_name":"Eugen Klöpfer","popularity":0.1765,"profile_path":"/ix8iib5AjtyQRbSIMx3j0CNRc9Q.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Pfarrer Hoppe","credit_id":"53e6d1f70e0a266fa1000755","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Werner Hinz","original_name":"Werner Hinz","popularity":0.0745,"profile_path":"/wNSIDc0fHIND1ckr3xwLuO87ZwV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Kaplan von Schigorski","credit_id":"53e6d2040e0a266f8d000784","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisabeth Flickenschildt","original_name":"Elisabeth Flickenschildt","popularity":0.201,"profile_path":"/ve95zh3QgOZqnFhqPnaVqY4OtU3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Maruschka","credit_id":"53e6d2130e0a266f9a0006f7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernst Behmer","original_name":"Ernst Behmer","popularity":0.0856,"profile_path":"/zskJNAT2ZtbW3jXtv0XCXMYlI1f.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Kutscher","credit_id":"53e6d21f0e0a266f91000744","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1713433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Otto Sauter-Sarto","original_name":"Otto Sauter-Sarto","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Fischer Ostrowski","credit_id":"5c7323b8c3a3685a3c175dda","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2249789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Berta Reschke","original_name":"Berta Reschke","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Frau Ostrowski","credit_id":"5c7323c80e0a262c1f7f3de1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1086843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gisela von Collande","original_name":"Gisela von Collande","popularity":0.1313,"profile_path":"/iLTOl6QStr1LndVqwUCFyMK1P9H.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Frau Nowosowska","credit_id":"5c7323db92514119e1af8a93","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55761,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Veit Harlan","original_name":"Veit Harlan","popularity":0.1952,"profile_path":"/uCkOnT3a6LCtw5A7Ze9NSEshfDm.jpg","credit_id":"53e6d1be0e0a266f9d00071d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1713660,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Max Halbe","original_name":"Max Halbe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d5f15dd924ce50016149910","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":157,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Thea von Harbou","original_name":"Thea von Harbou","popularity":0.298,"profile_path":"/jQ6EF2gcodiez6PFEOaqMMF3nfF.jpg","credit_id":"5d5f15e6924ce50017149287","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0030296","wikidata_id":"Q17478937","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3528LuHyhgYYTf4Wlxflou3rxxN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":787,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ntw91zmLlI4OT5bfANomuwRmW1w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":525},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2463,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xTyE4vbikyQAx2tmK6p6N4YNmOb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1641}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1938-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
