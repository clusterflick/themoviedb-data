This time he is off on a 'tour of inspection' with his trusted friend von Kleber. Things become complicated when von Kleber, pretending to be the emperor so as to protect the real Joseph from discovery, falls in love with Christine, the landlady of their lodgings. And when Christine later writes to the emperor, her letter is read by the mother of the real emperor, as keen as ever to see him getting married, and so the lady is invited to the imperial court.","popularity":0.5719,"poster_path":"/h1tRkxJ15SZ9XUORoH7xXFvPtQR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12372,"logo_path":"/lcQScIQXHQXuLMLFQt0loJl5gWJ.png","name":"UFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1941-12-19","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tanz mit dem Kaiser","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":48856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marika Rökk","original_name":"Marika Rökk","popularity":0.1973,"profile_path":"/8buBQSNMcpLIJAQsPU24aaZ2PtP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Christine von Alvin","credit_id":"53ed4af10e0a26191e000afc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolf Albach-Retty","original_name":"Wolf Albach-Retty","popularity":0.0592,"profile_path":"/4hh5ZAV3C7FQ2g4SOngiVkWoiJq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Rittmeister von Kleber","credit_id":"53ed4b020e0a26192e000b15","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":11936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Eis","original_name":"Maria Eis","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Kaiserin Maria Theresia","credit_id":"53ed4b150e0a261924000a8d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Axel von Ambesser","original_name":"Axel von Ambesser","popularity":0.1962,"profile_path":"/ptIPAeLh1NVNeNkvzMG9NpxDxwT.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Kaiser Joseph II. -
