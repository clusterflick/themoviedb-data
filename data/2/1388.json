The pair used found objects to construct a complex, interdependent contraption in an empty warehouse. When set in motion, a domino-like chain reaction ripples through the complex of imaginative devices. Fire, water, the laws of gravity, and chemistry determine the life-cycle of the objects. The process reveals a story concerning cause and effect, mechanism and art, and improbability and precision, in an extended science project that will mesmerize the mind.","popularity":0.5202,"poster_path":"/5Av0uOmsji4IZWrUHa6CnVZBULL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1987-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Way Things Go","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":25,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16864,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Fischli","original_name":"Peter Fischli","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/cKJ21dQzCN2JF8zGE80pPylJQj7.jpg","credit_id":"52fe42f2c3a36847f802eef5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16865,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Weiss","original_name":"David Weiss","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/oZDIzUGmZI7uh8fEciv6hy5Ige7.jpg","credit_id":"52fe42f2c3a36847f802eefb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0094300","wikidata_id":"Q290919","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8yLE3xFuQRoYl0NOXjX1zxVf67X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5Av0uOmsji4IZWrUHa6CnVZBULL.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1400},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iI7JtZZM4PL4CyHQLJT0jaAMvDU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3700,"name":"garbage"},{"id":1706,"name":"experiment"},{"id":5460,"name":"rube goldberg"},{"id":6023,"name":"drawing and painting"},{"id":2131,"name":"visual arts"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDb","release_date":"1987-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
