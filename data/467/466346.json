As this was the year of the centenary of the birth of director Michael Powell the location walk included visits to a lot of the places around Canterbury where Powell grew up. The documentary includes interviews with walk organizers Paul Tritton and Steve Crook as well as with various other people there. Some of the scenes from the film are re-created with people on the walk reading out the lines from scenes filmed at those locations 60+ years ago.","popularity":0.1604,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2006-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Canterbury Trail","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1851007,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Melanie Quigley","original_name":"Melanie Quigley","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"596858e492514132e1012162","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":466,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David M.
