As if that wasn't punishment enough, Abbey's mother and Greg's father reveal to the perplexed ex-couple that they are getting married. After the death of Leo's wife, the conservative, aristocratic Gwen and the Greek immigrant met and fell in love in a choir. Gwen and Leo's wedding would turn their estranged ex-partners into stepsiblings. An idea that deeply displeases both of them, as they have not yet overcome the injuries they inflicted on each other when they separated. Abbey and Greg try to talk their parents out of the wedding by any means necessary.","popularity":0.3629,"poster_path":"/9LLsOrQvQt5luTigaYKqGRbLGm1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rosamunde Pilcher: Wahlversprechen und andere Lügen","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":49200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denise Zich","original_name":"Denise Zich","popularity":0.2777,"profile_path":"/nEFN1530fdwhg4o48HRHb4I3C9e.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Abbey Norton","credit_id":"596852acc3a3687298010922","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1249797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim-Sarah Brandts","original_name":"Kim-Sarah Brandts","popularity":0.1252,"profile_path":"/ns8MzY0vJzqkyMWGYtdv2MbNRUB.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Isabell Norton","credit_id":"596852639251413175010577","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michele Oliveri","original_name":"Michele Oliveri","popularity":0.1973,"profile_path":"/orAsZWPrLJGBgIVMWEqNDUxq6y5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Leo Dukakis","credit_id":"5968527ec3a368776700ff2f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":38144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michaela May","original_name":"Michaela May","popularity":0.1835,"profile_path":"/dFCn6vA0eNQ8b5y3fceS1k4gsnm.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Gwen Norton","credit_id":"5a06511fc3a36878f0004bbf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sven Waasner","original_name":"Sven Waasner","popularity":0.0956,"profile_path":"/wjosfX2GuJFInKpXWu0oFypBNqH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Frank Campell","credit_id":"59685271c3a36875e901074e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1322411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francisco Medina","original_name":"Francisco Medina","popularity":0.1267,"profile_path":"/7R7IkDIA9o4a41B3X2RV9AJrlOU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Greg Dukakis","credit_id":"5968529e925141329c0102d1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1921346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Preiss","original_name":"Laura Preiss","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Julia Jones","credit_id":"5a065133925141140c004af3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stuart Davidson","original_name":"Stuart Davidson","popularity":0.4322,"profile_path":"/Wti4IHoN7Dl207OzQtDAqry9Wa.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Greek Caterer","credit_id":"5e90f0d4fdc4fa00156d8bad","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48889,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans-Jürgen Tögel","original_name":"Hans-Jürgen Tögel","popularity":0.2079,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"596852c7c3a3686f60010f56","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/rZ4r9WWRpgHF6s3fODYFhRbXWFI.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xP844DCXs1bjp9dLyWiOuIOwGvb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/9LLsOrQvQt5luTigaYKqGRbLGm1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/lD9dgIK0Yme05kMceQIxq2Zm4WP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2015-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
