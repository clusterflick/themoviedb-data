Everything's got to start over: everything's mad! Only the spivs are rich. When you're 16 with nothing but marbles in your pocket, you nick your schoolmate's savings and leave your home town for the bright lights of the city. Lost among the cute waifs and strays in Montmartre, Victor embarks on his city adventure with his sister's address as his only lifeline - a poor girl who survives by selling her charms and whose man nabs everything as soon as she gets it. The kids who play marbles on the wasteland keep their precious things to themselves but faced with Victor's fresh skin, the haggling starts and more than one of them gives in. He realises his worth and soon starts touting for business. He'll discover the artists of bohemian Montparnasse, as well as the riches of the smart districts.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/3JyogUeXGyUqliuLKCSHb5dR2ga.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65668,"logo_path":"/qHpNaCy2IGoTdyQkI2eD972E7Va.png","name":"French
