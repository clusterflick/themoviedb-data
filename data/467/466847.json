Brod, a professor of philosophy and leader in the pro-feminist men's movement, offers a unique take on the problem of sexual assault, one that complicates the issue even as it clarifies the bottom-line principle that consent must always be explicitly granted, never simply assumed.  In a nonthreatening, non-hectoring discussion that ranges from the meanings of \"yes\" and \"no\" to the indeterminacy of silence to the way alcohol affects our ethical responsibilities, Brod challenges young people to envision a model of sexual interaction that is most erotic precisely when it is most thoughtful and empathetic.","popularity":0.5673,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Asking For It: the Ethics & Erotics of Sexual Consent","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1853105,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Robertson","original_name":"Tom Robertson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"596c922bc3a36825c40009e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1184450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sut Jhally","original_name":"Sut Jhally","popularity":0.0778,"profile_path":"/a06JwBtL1mO2rQM2jILcvTf6NUX.jpg","credit_id":"596c9240c3a3685bb10039ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1653117,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Scott Morris","original_name":"Scott Morris","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"596c9275c3a3684c39012623","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7066,"name":"sex education"},{"id":18257,"name":"educational"},{"id":236789,"name":"consent"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
