The camera shakes, gets in and out of focus, and we don’t exactly know what is happening. At first this is a strange disorientation, but then you get used to it through the cyclical mechanical noise that joins the images. The words of a peaceful female voice allows you to frame the film: a visual exercise after all can also be free.","popularity":0.1966,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Is Not an Olive Tree","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"Isto Não é Uma Oliveira","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1851962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Schlesinger","original_name":"Rebecca Schlesinger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"596a4218925141798700a60e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1851961,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Arteiro","original_name":"Carlos Arteiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"596a4208925141798700a5fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":287803,"name":"experimental cinema"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
