Elysian Park I was shot at three different speeds: fast, normal and slow. A three and a half minute roll of film was shot, then rewound and shot twice more, thus the overlapping effect. Vastly different apertures and filters were used in each film. Elysian Park II was made with filters that rendered the film very dark.  It looks like it was shot at night, but was made in the middle of the day, like E.P. I.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elysian Park II","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1852996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Erenberg","original_name":"Sam Erenberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"596c56c8c3a3684c3900e045","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
