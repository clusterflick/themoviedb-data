In charting its story, Alastair brings a fresh eye to the work of pop art superstars Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein and tracks down pop's pioneers, from American artists like James Rosenquist, Claes Oldenburg and Ed Ruscha to British godfathers Peter Blake and Allen Jones. Alastair also explores how pop's fascination with celebrity, advertising and the mass media was part of a global art movement, and he travels to China to discover how a new generation of artists are reinventing pop art's satirical, political edge for the 21st century.","popularity":0.3744,"poster_path":"/tbL9WAC0GMpIj8ngVNBRhtXrF6G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soup Cans and Superstars: How Pop Art Changed the World","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Soppburken som blev världskändis: Popkonstens historia","type":"TV Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1257703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alastair Sooke","original_name":"Alastair Sooke","popularity":0.098,"profile_path":"/in8f8Xw38Sw8EUDiK5jZUssGUdc.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"596727169251415a4010c7d2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1307210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Blake","original_name":"Peter Blake","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e859e395294e700114a8914","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1720901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Rosenquist","original_name":"James Rosenquist","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/8DWwTO3sKRD4UgulP3gPXjfEpY0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e859e66da10f00018ede7e7","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1701176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jude Ho","original_name":"Jude Ho","popularity":0.0776,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5b17499251413389b8689f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5520602","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6mLWhtcNzwl4G8o39Xvy9TByLTs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tbL9WAC0GMpIj8ngVNBRhtXrF6G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":193156,"name":"pop art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
