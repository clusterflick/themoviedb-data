The tape opens with an idyllic representation of the Midwest and shifts into an expressive exploration of experiences within the narrow confines of a Midwestern moral code. The melodrama follows five main characters who find themselves together in a small motel; Crab, an agoraphobe, is employed as a clerk in the motel and lives at home with his family; Swallow, a recently escaped con and his lover, Jack; Katch, a woman dishonorably discharged from the military and her lover, Joy.\r The market place is a central focus for all the main charaters; as a place of potential employment, a site of crisis in representation, the public arena where the status quo is policed and, ultimately, a closed barrier whereby the \"norm\" is protected.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/41lpBnpRVhMWLUXEGTUdppWIp2p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88516,"logo_path":null,"name":"VTape","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Agora","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1850066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donald Kinney","original_name":"Donald Kinney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59666365c3a36825e8117a39","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1850069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Kinney","original_name":"Robert Kinney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5966636dc3a368253c10e344","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":752,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/41lpBnpRVhMWLUXEGTUdppWIp2p.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1992-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
