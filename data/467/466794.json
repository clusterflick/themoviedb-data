With the 16mm Bolex camera mounted on a tripod, I wound the motor a single crank and ran as far as I could before the camera stopped (about 1 second). I returned and wound it 2 cranks and did the same, then repeated the process adding one crank each time. With these self-imposed limitations, would I make it to the top of the hill before the film ran out?","popularity":0.0713,"poster_path":"/bjnXFYOBMiujsZwA9PdpW97nkUG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Degrees of Limitation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1204992,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Scott Stark","original_name":"Scott Stark","popularity":0.1016,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"596c15eec3a3684c02008cfa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1853,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bjnXFYOBMiujsZwA9PdpW97nkUG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1235}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
