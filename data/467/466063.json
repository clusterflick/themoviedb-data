Everett Koop, Robert Frost and 100+ Winter Olympians have in common? They all spent time at Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH where winters are long and snowy.  Passion for Snow traces over 100 years of ski history in the United States with a focus on the many contributions of Dartmouth College and its alumni to the formation, growth and ongoing innovations in all aspects of snowsports. Passion for Snow combines firsthand accounts from early ski pioneers, veterans of the 10th Mountain Division, Olympians, members of the U.S. Ski Hall of Fame and top ski industry and resort executives, who explain how the most remotely located college in the Ivy League helped spawn a $25 billion industry, and continues to shape it today.","popularity":0.7377,"poster_path":"/36NanUrrAsUyZNxWBAn0QLALb1z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Dartmouth Skiing Story","title":"Passion for Snow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Buck Henry","original_name":"Buck Henry","popularity":0.3139,"profile_path":"/iAOjaj5OHMMXno65MwmDtkqHeb6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"59663ee1c3a3680dec10533f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1849885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tryg Myhren","original_name":"Tryg Myhren","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59664128c3a36828fc10f3f0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1849886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Morten","original_name":"John Morten","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"596641369251410a591278a2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1849891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Corcoran","original_name":"Tom Corcoran","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"596641f09251410bfa1311df","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1849867,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephen Waterhouse","original_name":"Stephen Waterhouse","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59663b6ac3a368293b134106","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1849879,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lisa Densmore","original_name":"Lisa Densmore","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59663e99c3a36828a1146bcd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1849867,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephen Waterhouse","original_name":"Stephen Waterhouse","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59663e8c9251415a400fa77a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1849879,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lisa Densmore","original_name":"Lisa Densmore","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5966419bc3a36828fc10f46c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":844,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vjSdNVJrEb1AxXaI5YxCQCbFszn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":815,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4Cu659ykMldz9i3KjdQsi7H5xuR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1448}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/36NanUrrAsUyZNxWBAn0QLALb1z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1442,"name":"winter"},{"id":3616,"name":"college"},{"id":6018,"name":"new hampshire"},{"id":10794,"name":"snow"},{"id":159558,"name":"snow skiing"},{"id":201953,"name":"winter games"},{"id":220840,"name":"winter sport"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Passion For Snow Teaser","key":"BXOoxFYmrUM","published_at":"2013-03-26T21:54:08.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"59663ad2c3a36825e8114507"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Dartmouth's Passion for Snowâ€“Clip","key":"e_YXQVXb95Y","published_at":"2012-03-14T17:17:25.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"59663ae39251410b8612bdb1"}]}}}
