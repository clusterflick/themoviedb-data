Born in exile in Syria he was first imprisoned at the age of 14, he was never charged but was 'guilty of carrying thoughts'. Repeatedly imprisoned and tortured over the next 20 years he says that writing poetry saved his sanity. Ghazi eventually arrived in Scotland in 2000. After a three-year legal battle, the legal evidence of the torture he had endured led him to being granted asylum in Scotland.  This short film, directed by award winning British/Iranian filmmaker Roxana Vilk explores his poetry as a narrative thread to unravel the complex emotional journey he has travelled through and how he came to eventually call Edinburgh his home.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Came From The Unknown To Sing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4776371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roxana Vilk","original_name":"Roxana Vilk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666d7c2ac0e7e6f187a7cdc3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
