In this programme, we look back at an extraordinary broadcasting career which spanned almost 40 years.  Fronting series such as Trust Me I’m a Doctor and the hit podcast Just One Thing, Michael used his warm, often funny approach to deliver important, life-changing health messages.  He started behind the scenes as an award-winning science journalist and producer, before becoming a much-loved presenter. His programmes have made a lasting impact on the nation’s health habits, from intermittent fasting to the benefits of a cold shower.  Michael also shared his own struggles with audiences worldwide. As a chronic insomniac, he made programmes about sleep and, ever curious, he would also go to extremes in the pursuit of science, even infecting himself with a tapeworm. Celebrating Michael’s career, this programme marks the enormous impact he made, touching the lives of so many.","popularity":0.2161,"poster_path":"/1SBOtynpUh9gwyhhQYT50baeEHD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Michael Mosley: The Doctor Who Changed Britain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pvzt5uTsPDNV3yxRg4NEkSdAy7B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":912,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1SBOtynpUh9gwyhhQYT50baeEHD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":608}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":13005,"name":"doctor"},{"id":34079,"name":"death"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BBC One","release_date":"2024-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
