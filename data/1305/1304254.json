The connection between art and daily life, as well as the game between egocentrism and self-distance, characterises their artistic work. They use their body as dispositive – a medium available for transformation in order to explore their sexual ambivalence and polyvalence treating gender and sex as a constant changing performative act. Toma Alice Péronnet converts the public space into a \"stage of living art” for spontaneous interactions.","popularity":0.0555,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alicia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2586358,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juana Robles","original_name":"Juana Robles","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666b572adb55479cef5ab65a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
