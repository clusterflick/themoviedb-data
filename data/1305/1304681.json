After two years in which censorship was relaxed, in 1977 it was completely abolished, and the “S” classification was created to protect viewers from those films that could “hurt their sensitivity.” The “S” classification was granted when the content was especially violent, sexual or political, creating a mixed bag in which all types of unclassifiable films could fit. In force from 1978 to 1983, this classification turned out to be a great commercial attraction for a society that had suffered four decades of national-Catholic dictatorship and repression.","popularity":1.1435,"poster_path":"/uZentdoTuGZ1sqwn4EMPfWaRsgO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38474,"logo_path":"/wDtZ0YB3KOaVSNGQjoFOc20YPap.png","name":"Severin Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In post-Franco Spain, the revolution began on screen","title":"Exorcismo: The Transgressive Legacy of Clasificada 'S'","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iggy Pop","original_name":"Iggy Pop","popularity":1.0052,"profile_path":"/kZwFoGujhS3D39R1uyuyNbgSPr0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Narrator","credit_id":"666ca7bb744bfa961bde0b7b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gaspar Noé","original_name":"Gaspar Noé","popularity":1.0018,"profile_path":"/wyUEwuZr3ATzltxxS4puwT5RS0b.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Self","credit_id":"670cfdd2f58a9206aa415d0d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57865,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Álex de la Iglesia","original_name":"Álex de la Iglesia","popularity":0.2532,"profile_path":"/nfFGSO2Yn5kJTxaTep3lHfyQG6O.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Self","credit_id":"670cfe06f58a9206aa415d22","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30956,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jesús Franco","original_name":"Jesús Franco","popularity":0.6047,"profile_path":"/sVhaKFvmqD80EbWLTu7sGMbGDt0.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Self - Archive footage","credit_id":"670cfe94d5f93a3da0bbb0f8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168811,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ricard Reguant","original_name":"Ricard Reguant","popularity":0.0794,"profile_path":"/nTcGB0bvjHG25KJ0eRcCwK9Revi.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Self","credit_id":"670cff244df59a608c639d07","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Taylor","original_name":"Jack Taylor","popularity":0.3351,"profile_path":"/bTqdz2PeN9bPN3y6pvFehBAKTAI.jpg","cast_id":21,"character":"Self","credit_id":"670cffcfb15d97b1a93d0813","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5002046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alejandro Melero","original_name":"Alejandro Melero","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"Self","credit_id":"670e782e0b800537d75cfabe","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1208935,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Álex Mendíbil","original_name":"Álex Mendíbil","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/bh33D4QKin3IC72hlib9CLH4yxH.jpg","cast_id":23,"character":"Self","credit_id":"670e7846d5f93a3da0bc4ed4","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Mayans","original_name":"Antonio Mayans","popularity":2.0335,"profile_path":"/vA1qDHVekxZR3QMZJYVnemIB6wN.jpg","cast_id":24,"character":"Self","credit_id":"670e78509f3531e6b26c7381","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100897,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carlos Puerto","original_name":"Carlos Puerto","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":"/oHYXwEfD5rcJto3po10292FmaoA.jpg","cast_id":25,"character":"Self","credit_id":"670e785e9f3531e6b26c738e","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1445616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmen Serret","original_name":"Carmen Serret","popularity":0.4061,"profile_path":"/AuqgkgaGapgBDfzf3gjLwiGFodr.jpg","cast_id":26,"character":"Self","credit_id":"670e786b9f3531e6b26c7398","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":219783,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Gregory","original_name":"David Gregory","popularity":0.1087,"profile_path":"/yTgMxwff5enKKWu12xa6Uyt2IpO.jpg","cast_id":27,"character":"Self","credit_id":"670e787ab15d97b1a93d9741","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1700032,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gloria Sancho","original_name":"Gloria Sancho","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":28,"character":"Self","credit_id":"670e789342e1391c566719ae","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1413917,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ignasi P.
