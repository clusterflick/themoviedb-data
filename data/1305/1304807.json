Today it is one of the cities with the most murders per capita. Bringing together stories about five emblematic Acapulco objects and characters, Biombo de Acapulco is an experimental documentary that records the contrasting complexity of this once-global port. Combining a non-linear and polyphonic narrative with a discordant montage composed of diverse audiovisual materials about the place, the film is inspired by the oriental screens that arrived in America through the port of Acapulco in the 16th century.","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":"/fjz11E6ZjPBVI5qxRcj7aOX8tN9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2024-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Acapulco Folding Screen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3300074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Unidad de Montaje Dialéctico","original_name":"Unidad de Montaje Dialéctico","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667078022d6daa4f85c357ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1405,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fjz11E6ZjPBVI5qxRcj7aOX8tN9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1054}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"Festival Internacional de Cine UNAM","release_date":"2024-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
