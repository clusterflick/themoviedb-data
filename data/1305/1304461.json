The school had been founded in Chicago in 1937 as the New Bauhaus: American School of Design, but it was closed after only one year. In 1939 Moholy-Nagy founded another school, the School of Design in Chicago, which was reorganized and renamed the Institute of Design in 1944. In 1956 the Institute of Design became a department of the Illinois Institute of Technology, where it continues today.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1943-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Student exhibition #1 - unedited fragments","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"László Moholy-Nagy","original_name":"László Moholy-Nagy","popularity":0.0432,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666c0655b92bc9015124acee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1943-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
