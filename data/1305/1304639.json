In this film, inspired by the cycle of nature through the four main elements (water, wind, earth and fire), existence follows non-existence and vice versa, and worlds are linked. With the help of the music, which is exactly based on the evolution of the film and serves to further express its meaning, the audience is immersed from beginning to end, in one event after another, hearing a complete symphony. The notes or frequencies of these compositions are interpreted by algorithms, which generate an evolving, organic film, a kind of matter in motion. My aim is to show the movement of matter in space, as well as its change and transformation in the context of time and space. I leave interpretation open to audiences with different points of view. â€“ K.K.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Enharmonique - Chapitre 4","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4775277,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kaveh Kavoosi","original_name":"Kaveh Kavoosi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666c9416766e291d792d08b4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
