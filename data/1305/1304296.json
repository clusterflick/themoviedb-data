What I admired about her was her absolute courage, and this was shown by the concept and execution of her dance at the Whitney. Most dancers hesitate a little when they are called upon to do something which might involve a disconcerting accident, but Trisha always did whatever was called for without that moment of hesitation.  – Walter Gutman","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/8GCaQ0lqmTTFLH31iGQ2iBpMFsr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Trisha Brown Company at the Whitney Museum 1971 - The Rehearsal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1193385,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Gutman","original_name":"Walter Gutman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666b68fe22c29c5df5382e82","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8GCaQ0lqmTTFLH31iGQ2iBpMFsr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
