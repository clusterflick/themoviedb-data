Missing in action for many years, this raucous comedy of army life, which looks back on the latter days of WWII, is a slam-bang showcase for the boisterous variety antics of comedian Hal Monty, seen here in his heyday performing rough and ready slapstick sketches aplenty. Heâ€™s accompanied by regular foil Les Ritchie, as his uptight sergeant, and comical crooner Max Bygraves, in his screen debut.","popularity":0.2482,"poster_path":"/dJOtDbZSVSrL8f6ue4xH6p4Tcit.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1949-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bless 'em all","video":false,"vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1917358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hal Monty","original_name":"Hal Monty","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Skimpy Carter","credit_id":"59fddf2e925141470501b8bc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":996619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Bygraves","original_name":"Max Bygraves","popularity":0.2107,"profile_path":"/x6A2rKAqUox43Os7KlgHCTPvsOB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tommy Anderson","credit_id":"59fddf4c92514146f501c379","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3123099,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arthur Dent","original_name":"Arthur Dent","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618e52475f2b8d008f935c93","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3306581,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"C.
