This documentary wants to recount the life of the trees and their deep relationship with people that every day work hard to give to the wood a second life. What happens in this second life of the wood, when it becomes boats for sailing and musical instruments for playing... The trees is the opposite of movement: it dies where it's born. But there exists a second life that starts as soon as its saps stop flowing inside its vessels: forests became fleets that explored the world's geography while writing the Romance of the Earth.","popularity":0.0883,"poster_path":"/4zS6nPtQb5E216bAwgtEofuBm6V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trees that walk","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1717106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mattia Colombo","original_name":"Mattia Colombo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a02dbed92514111e4012dfb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1112540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erri De Luca","original_name":"Erri De Luca","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":"/vktUQ5jmf9Z0dyAXNf3ihWkxOwc.jpg","credit_id":"5a02dbb6c3a36863a2012cd6","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1717106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mattia Colombo","original_name":"Mattia Colombo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a02dbabc3a368637f0123fc","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3168792","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/4zS6nPtQb5E216bAwgtEofuBm6V.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/3uYDGlqY9PkQHvGtKnKAWu9T7sF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.738,"height":1897,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/igFKnarcea67sFFZmiuLoNDB5J4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
