Conducting insightful interviews with all four band members as well as filming them at work in the studio as they were planning and rehearsing their forthcoming North American Tour, and then following them as they performed across the US, Bob captured a band attempting to replicate their huge domestic success on the global stage. To mark the 40th anniversary of the release of the News of the World album, the footage has now been carefully restored and revisited to compile this hour-long portrait of a group setting out to take the next step on their remarkable journey to becoming one of the biggest bands on the planet.","popularity":1.294,"poster_path":"/lNcmXoNGjKLSocZpU18uXa7Hy9c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8273,"logo_path":"/pXZ6qUs6bZUsS5zsRXrojW9aZ1f.png","name":"Eagle Rock Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"News of the World Tour","title":"Queen: Rock the World","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Queen - Rock the World","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Freddie Mercury","original_name":"Freddie Mercury","popularity":0.5671,"profile_path":"/29YpQZNzrGJtoa49ZVo2XLKZuQr.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self - Member Queen (archive footage)","credit_id":"59fd924f92514147330126ae","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian May","original_name":"Brian May","popularity":0.3142,"profile_path":"/rTqWm7dZLbrprpKMtOAOeCcj24e.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Member Queen","credit_id":"59fd9257c3a368683501378f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Taylor","original_name":"Roger Taylor","popularity":0.3205,"profile_path":"/4bGDceuYlMPBXIp4XgwettWynJt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self - Member Queen","credit_id":"59fd9260c3a36868530134de","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Deacon","original_name":"John Deacon","popularity":0.2469,"profile_path":"/ucbtgzdLR5oeVXfsTkbxl5TBU5z.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self - Member Queen","credit_id":"59fd926692514146f5012c2a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1241814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Harris","original_name":"Bob Harris","popularity":0.0817,"profile_path":"/xQa96zJgYReC1XpQjipjtb8k77n.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self - Narrator, Interviewer","credit_id":"5ac75e4f0e0a264974025a0c","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian May","original_name":"Brian May","popularity":0.3142,"profile_path":"/rTqWm7dZLbrprpKMtOAOeCcj24e.jpg","credit_id":"5c28b9a592514138c8c072f6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":181552,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Christopher Bird","original_name":"Christopher Bird","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c28b85f92514138cbc05cf4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7804016","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pgO7Rch9JvMzzQdg0wEpGEJrRBu.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1122,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A2Ef5yQdOeoAyGrnkymniUFsCf6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1995}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lNcmXoNGjKLSocZpU18uXa7Hy9c.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pvPCMkLu7GYvNZEYEkNNAXPrFbp.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8U7vdyPA9jlGd62QTMvs8adqWQ8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1228,"name":"1970s"},{"id":5321,"name":"studio"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":9817,"name":"behind the scenes"},{"id":11700,"name":"rock music"},{"id":192694,"name":"lost footage"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"TV premiere","release_date":"2017-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"QUEEN: ROCK THE WORLD trailer","key":"nUsQtgqIYQk","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","published_at":"2018-10-15T16:19:17.000Z","official":false,"id":"5c28b6d30e0a264f4233cc6c"}]}}}
