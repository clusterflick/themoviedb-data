One of them is 78-year-old Denzo, whose son and his wife consider him senile. Left alone, he befriends a young boy, Sentaro, who has heard that the old man was once a great angler. The unlikely pair spend lots of happy time together, until Denzo has a heart attack and dies far upstream. The dam is completed and the entire area is inundated. Everyone will move away, except Denzo.","popularity":0.2677,"poster_path":"/cvnVqRVK8WScrgzCqXqfFh5gtxB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1983-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hometown","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Furusato","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoshi Katō","original_name":"加藤嘉","popularity":0.4645,"profile_path":"/6LpDUFHaIfbrDxEuMMEsUHFX9oy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Denzo","credit_id":"59ffed15c3a368689305a9ec","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":135131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hiroyuki Nagato","original_name":"長門裕之","popularity":0.5302,"profile_path":"/4mRLJoy4qPoMiGmPnOGmhjCU7Hg.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Denroku","credit_id":"59ffed26c3a368687e04d26c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seijiro Koyama","original_name":"神山征二郎","popularity":0.1463,"profile_path":"/m15oIjw5wTmpteyd3hdPCesJjKw.jpg","credit_id":"59ffecc3925141470c05759d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1609731,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Fuminori Minami","original_name":"Fuminori Minami","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59ffecfdc3a3686853058879","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seijiro Koyama","original_name":"神山征二郎","popularity":0.1463,"profile_path":"/m15oIjw5wTmpteyd3hdPCesJjKw.jpg","credit_id":"59ffecb8925141470c057579","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0171332","wikidata_id":"Q4145084","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/cvnVqRVK8WScrgzCqXqfFh5gtxB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1067},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/z4cr5DzbB2fk9UQyVrZTpNXoNrf.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
