And this is the story of a young boy who grew up in that country, and how he ended up challenging -- and sometimes even convincing -- the greatest powers in the world to follow Costa Rica's example. \"Oscar Arias: Without a Shot Fired\" is a Don Quixote-like saga with great historical touchstones -- Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, Cold War politics and Communism, Central American War and Peace. It follows a slight, academic, and most unlikely hero over the course of more than fifty years, as he travels the world in a quest to stop the spread of the weapons of war. In the end, it is a story about the triumph of reason, of the sparrow triumphing over the eagle, and how the impossible dream can sometimes come true.","popularity":0.6368,"poster_path":"/lMPVX1e4aqiHWam5wn4WAZWqsQ3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96915,"logo_path":null,"name":"PeaceJam
