Paulus Potter's simple postcard scene entitled \"The Young Bull\" (\"den jungen Stier\") is artistically alienated in an imposing fashion. By using assorted means of \"painting over\" and/or front projections, the figure of the bull in the center of the card is placed in a state of constant flux. A viewer may also choose to follow the shifting background behind the bull, which continues to recontextualize the bull in shifting worlds. Accompanied by a sound collage.","popularity":0.0322,"poster_path":"/tHf1O99Q4odH0Y4pHGbqLkVq1Qc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72750,"logo_path":"/nvDTUVfgu0KEDs8wuod74e6sLM6.png","name":"DEFA-Studio für Wochenschau und Dokumentarfilme","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"}],"release_date":"1981-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Potter's Bull","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Verwandlungen: Potter's Stier","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174652,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jürgen Böttcher","original_name":"Jürgen Böttcher","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zzgq3s7shKd6zIabGIIG3s7afxq.jpg","credit_id":"65dda01f903c520163bc7d57","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174652,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jürgen Böttcher","original_name":"Jürgen Böttcher","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zzgq3s7shKd6zIabGIIG3s7afxq.jpg","credit_id":"65dda00f903c520163bc7d43","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38196,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Thomas Plenert","original_name":"Thomas Plenert","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dda02e3ff2df01640a8d9b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174652,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jürgen Böttcher","original_name":"Jürgen Böttcher","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zzgq3s7shKd6zIabGIIG3s7afxq.jpg","credit_id":"5a022fe392514111af000dfd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0417063","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.738,"height":813,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tHf1O99Q4odH0Y4pHGbqLkVq1Qc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1078,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4LfhHKJAgvZLUbVXyfYxVgZJ6cN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":718}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
