Blending interviews with some of the world’s great historians, economists, anthropologists, and social critics with on-the-ground footage shot in twenty-two countries, CAPITALISM questions the myth of the unfettered free market, explores the nature of debt and commodities, and retraces some of the great economic debates of the last 200 years. The series features some of the world’s top economists, historians, anthropologists, and sociologists, including Thomas Piketty, Noam Chomsky, Yanis Varoufakis, Nicholas Phillipson, Kari Polanyi Levitt, David Graeber, and Abraham Rotstein. - icarusfilms.com","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":"/gYzhbZmEvpxud3QAkjxZs5Jv6I1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2014-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":320,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Capitalism","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":209942,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilan Ziv","original_name":"Ilan Ziv","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59ffff0ec3a368683505bac6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4896038","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.691,"height":2894,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gYzhbZmEvpxud3QAkjxZs5Jv6I1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
