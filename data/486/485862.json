He drives around in a car that's one big ad for himself and occasionally makes the local news with some freak incident. When the film starts he has just burned down his trailer and caused a traffic jam. He then hits the road with a DV cam to capture real life. A friend promised him he could sell such material to an Italian TV station. When he meets a famous singer on the way and gets drawn into her story things get interesting.","popularity":1.675,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Promised Land","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1053927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chad Smith","original_name":"Chad Smith","popularity":0.1,"profile_path":"/lq2pHc8k3LagaWVVLOWLWQ7SaZV.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Ethan Wildwood","credit_id":"5a02e8b992514111af015077","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":125047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lalaine","original_name":"Lalaine","popularity":0.4785,"profile_path":"/tUNBeQcNBcaY0yJkYK7UTaM2lvZ.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Norma","credit_id":"5a02e8ccc3a36861aa0129a7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giuseppe Cederna","original_name":"Giuseppe Cederna","popularity":0.1585,"profile_path":"/c38oQexxu4ItKbN8RYDD01cGtan.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Mulligan","credit_id":"5a02e8e2c3a36861d401511e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1163066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stanley B.
