Within the tense, haunted context of the harbour and the seaside, and together with them, we slowly lose all sense of time and place. Without investigating their past or their future, the human traffic organisations or the Belgian legislation, the film transgresses into the timelessness in which our society imprisons people without papers. This subtle analysis of human exclusion and the reduction of human beings to the physical body makes us wonder if a human can be illegal at all?","popularity":0.1234,"poster_path":"/20vZzwQuJSrrDZK9MSAEqH09zAv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109423,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cassette for Timescapes","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2010-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Not Waving, But Drowning","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1410871,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Larry Sider","original_name":"Larry Sider","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653cd4155907de0138e14a8b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1736983,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Elias Grootaers","original_name":"Elias Grootaers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59ff960c925141473304cfff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1736983,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Elias Grootaers","original_name":"Elias Grootaers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59ff9618c3a36868350510db","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266010,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Philippe Ciompi","original_name":"Philippe Ciompi","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64be8c1bc51acd00af63848a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1120546,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dieter Diependaele","original_name":"Dieter Diependaele","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64be8c41e9da6900cb7cda50","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1736983,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Elias Grootaers","original_name":"Elias Grootaers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64be8c4cac6c7908e087254f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1120546,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dieter Diependaele","original_name":"Dieter Diependaele","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64be8c37c51acd0102b220e4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1617285,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Emmy Oost","original_name":"Emmy Oost","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64be8c64b865eb011ca0c773","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1594929","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/20vZzwQuJSrrDZK9MSAEqH09zAv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":708}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
