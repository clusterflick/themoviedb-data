Most friends meet for dinner, or at the pub, but for these four old school friends their monthly get together is in the unsettling surroundings of an intensive care unit. Siobhan is a failing TV presenter, Sarah is a rather reluctant mother of three, Pip is a pseudo bohemian and Lucy, well Lucy is in a coma. After the initial shock, the three old school friends soon realise that Lucy is in dire need of help, if only they could provide it. As Lucy becomes more aware of what is going on around her, we delve into unexpected and funny moments from her subconscious.","popularity":0.8499,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coma Girl","video":false,"vote_average":2.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":207384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Solemani","original_name":"Sarah Solemani","popularity":0.5029,"profile_path":"/xwzeUblCcYB9Aexs9ZqdDtZOnZb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Siobhan","credit_id":"5a020d559251412d24002747","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":62975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katy Wix","original_name":"Katy Wix","popularity":0.3542,"profile_path":"/vVr5KhTeqvxTjgYE1xA6SnfxUuB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sarah","credit_id":"5a020d619251412d24002760","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":74158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katherine Parkinson","original_name":"Katherine Parkinson","popularity":1.4343,"profile_path":"/8broF5f3gZsySdtdbpbyiVtCn6n.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Pip","credit_id":"5a020d70c3a36868af00256b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1233545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Crilly","original_name":"Anna Crilly","popularity":0.0986,"profile_path":"/wT6e4gDsQwrJjhXlIAj5IhcLICy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lucy","credit_id":"5a020d839251412d17002842","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":137471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Deakin","original_name":"Julia Deakin","popularity":0.4347,"profile_path":"/jo2uM3LS5DjwAzsIxvMbmewbZlF.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mrs Kay","credit_id":"5a020d94c3a36867ce0026d9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1466145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joanna Neary","original_name":"Joanna Neary","popularity":0.0993,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Judith","credit_id":"5a020da29251412ccc00275d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gwen Taylor","original_name":"Gwen Taylor","popularity":0.4986,"profile_path":"/jFn4ehkvGhwUH9f8YtXQVXnUpaF.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Bernie","credit_id":"5a020dac9251412cbf002836","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ifan Huw Dafydd","original_name":"Ifan Huw Dafydd","popularity":0.2514,"profile_path":"/4EZiobWxlHiJ4cH6MO8o178L2tT.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Driver","credit_id":"5a020dbf9251412ccc00279c","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1919372,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcus Onilude","original_name":"Marcus Onilude","popularity":0.1218,"profile_path":"/aiK0T1ln24omJcgQd8XkTein4Xp.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Benjie","credit_id":"5a020dd1c3a36868410025b3","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":233319,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elaine Cameron","original_name":"Elaine Cameron","popularity":0.1079,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a020e1e9251412d24002933","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":210034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abigail Wilson","original_name":"Abigail Wilson","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a020e08c3a36868af0026ab","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1803807,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Delaney","original_name":"Simon Delaney","popularity":0.0863,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a3ac474925141547508ce08","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
