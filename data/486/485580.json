We have ventilators, dialysis machines, ICUs-technologies that can \"fix\" us and keep our bodies alive-which have radically changed how we make medical decisions. In our death-denying culture, no matter how sick we get, there is always \"hope.\" Defining Hope tells the story of patients dealing with life-threatening illness as they move between ICUs, operating rooms, hospice care and home. Diane is a nurse caring for end-stage cancer patients when she is diagnosed with ovarian cancer herself. 23-year-old Alena undergoes a risky brain surgery that destroys her short-term memory. 95-year-old Berthold lives with his elderly wife who struggles to honor his wish of dying peacefully at home. Defining Hope follows these patients and others- and the nurses that guide them along the way- as they face death, embrace hope, and ultimately redefine what makes life worth living.","popularity":0.4168,"poster_path":"/sH3y1ZYQZJ1N3j0qBRduDZ14PV6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":179179,"logo_path":null,"name":"Carolyn Jones Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Defining Hope","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1969745,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolph Bilotti Sr.","original_name":"Rudolph Bilotti Sr.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a70c73b92514137510134d0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3633092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Berthold Cohen","original_name":"Berthold Cohen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62d9c575df2945004c42f57c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3633093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte Cohen","original_name":"Charlotte Cohen","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/2FJ5F3i8daYDBOcR4jpUDGJrKgq.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62d9c58ee10f46004f96177e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3633094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmen Hernandez","original_name":"Carmen Hernandez","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62d9c59df6596f00b6fdeb4f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3633096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deborah LaFond","original_name":"Deborah LaFond","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Self -
