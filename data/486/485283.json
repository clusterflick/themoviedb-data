Maggie escapes her loneliness and the chaos of her family by entering the strangely beautiful world she discovers through the viewfinder of her snap-n-shoot camera. Yet, unable to trust that what she sees is worth capturing, she never takes a picture. When the family makes a pit stop in the middle of nowhere, Maggie's feelings of being invisible are intensified after she is accidentally left behind. There at the gas station she meets June, the desert-worn, reclusive proprietor who proves more than just a passing influence on this little girl's journey to find her own voice.","popularity":0.3425,"poster_path":"/iyF648gSZZ6GpJu09GNhZGcYvMJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Inspiration Lives in the Most Unlikely Places","title":"Pitstop","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1917936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shawnna Youngquist","original_name":"Shawnna Youngquist","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Maggie","credit_id":"59fee026c3a368687e0313d4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1917937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Helene","original_name":"Andrea Helene","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":"/6XJRSyDxN1vztvDmdJF8UeXf4W5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"June","credit_id":"59fee0359251414705036a19","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1451392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gretchen Koerner","original_name":"Gretchen Koerner","popularity":0.2188,"profile_path":"/6D7LrZnGCtBoh2i7nXWW3i8KyU5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Connie","credit_id":"59fee045c3a3686844034616","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1917938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blake Oswald","original_name":"Blake Oswald","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Joe","credit_id":"59fee052c3a36868a703139b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1917939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Day","original_name":"Mary Day","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Sister / mary","credit_id":"59fee061c3a3686835039de5","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1917940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melanie McGraw","original_name":"Melanie McGraw","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59fee073c3a36867f603b318","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1917940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melanie McGraw","original_name":"Melanie McGraw","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59fee07c9251414705036aa3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1052032","wikidata_id":"Q4338508","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.603,"height":1045,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iyF648gSZZ6GpJu09GNhZGcYvMJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":630}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
