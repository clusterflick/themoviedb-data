This black and white film begins with an introduction by Bertrand Russell, who explains the history of the run-up to the American involvement in Vietnam. The film shows scenes of Vietnamese soldiers in trenches, American helicopters, agricultural workers, and children assembling anti-aircraft shells. A narrator speaks of the American invasion as being on par with the Germans during World War II and characterizes the Vietnamese as resistance fighters. Anti-American protests are shown. Ivens is shown interviewing Ho Chi Minh. Vietnamese villagers build dams for rice paddies, make traps using bamboo spikes, and take cover during air raids. Scenes include the headquarters of the National Liberation Front, a military execution, bombings, and villagers fighting back against US aggression.","popularity":0.3466,"poster_path":"/mZ2lvP2biUblwvMfvjbYzVElOcJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31117,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dovidis","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"VN","name":"Vietnam"}],"release_date":"1966-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Threatening Sky","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Il cielo e la terra","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"O Céu, a Terra","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joris Ivens","original_name":"Joris Ivens","popularity":0.2496,"profile_path":"/fNUOfmwxX37zV05kkbK4EFSrAfY.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Interviewer","credit_id":"5d48be77a0be2841a3a13582","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hồ Chí Minh","original_name":"Hồ Chí Minh","popularity":0.0892,"profile_path":"/cc8CN9THrMfv7qhVflrilSxmoWG.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d48be7d2d1e400199c0c53c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1249714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bertrand Russell","original_name":"Bertrand Russell","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d48be852d1e405db5c1767a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lindsay Anderson","original_name":"Lindsay Anderson","popularity":0.5796,"profile_path":"/l4R2RoLdqtY8xLrrt6v176tbtNQ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator (UK)","credit_id":"5d48be8c028f140012008334","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serge Reggiani","original_name":"Serge Reggiani","popularity":0.2608,"profile_path":"/7URSpmWp6SDIfLhKoPExc2oueet.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5d48bf97a0be28081ea4cd97","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joris Ivens","original_name":"Joris Ivens","popularity":0.2496,"profile_path":"/fNUOfmwxX37zV05kkbK4EFSrAfY.jpg","credit_id":"59fdde16c3a368686801a879","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1917352,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Robert Destanques","original_name":"Robert Destanques","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59fdde2092514146f501c0bb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1545828,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Catherine Dourgnan","original_name":"Catherine Dourgnan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59fdde3ac3a368686801a8bd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1917354,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Thu Van","original_name":"Thu Van","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59fdde30c3a368689301d5c1","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1917353,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Duc Hoa","original_name":"Duc Hoa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59fdde29c3a36868a7018e4c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2379898,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"J.-C.
