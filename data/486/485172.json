But the story is interrupted by a bandit raid in which Ishvaku’s mother is killed, and Ishvaku is packed off to his ancestral village in the Chambal Valley ravines of Central India. There he discovers a family in crisis, whose rituals, traditions and orthodox feudal values are becoming redundant. Meanwhile, Ishvaku’s own life take a strange turn, as a visiting sacred bull predicts that both wisdom and tragedy will soon come to him. In anticipation of such tragedy, Ishvaku attempts to escape into the magical realm of Ashwatthama","popularity":0.2066,"poster_path":"/7iZNmFqoSsZARBdzUzZSujgRL0F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2017-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ashwatthama","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1429176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aryan","original_name":"Aryan","popularity":0.0566,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Ishvaku","credit_id":"59fdfe8cc3a368686801e71f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1917565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chitra sharma","original_name":"Chitra sharma","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"59fe00c492514146f50207e7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1929846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sangeeta Kumari","original_name":"Sangeeta Kumari","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Mathu didi","credit_id":"5a1ac3bb925141033603dc17","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1438945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pushpendra Singh","original_name":"Pushpendra Singh","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/5p4kzyr7Xtg7qZkEh0rDHKfAdDb.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"5da17b6e1967570017a75bb5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2997769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashya","original_name":"Ashya","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":"/a7VUEsMsqs0coBANBeYviTXQc0V.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Laali","credit_id":"604058f6813cb6006ff9e605","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2473099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anju Singh","original_name":"Anju Singh","popularity":0.0904,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"","credit_id":"6147998585da12008ca85ee8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3240369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pravendra Singh","original_name":"Pravendra Singh","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"","credit_id":"61479998a6ddcb00621457b0","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2264472,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Amrendra Srivastava","original_name":"Amrendra Srivastava","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c8909379251410ce2c0f28a","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2264472,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Amrendra Srivastava","original_name":"Amrendra Srivastava","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c8909c1c3a36824bf0a8bd9","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1438945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pushpendra Singh","original_name":"Pushpendra Singh","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/5p4kzyr7Xtg7qZkEh0rDHKfAdDb.jpg","credit_id":"5da17b37afe2240018e872b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1438945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pushpendra Singh","original_name":"Pushpendra Singh","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/5p4kzyr7Xtg7qZkEh0rDHKfAdDb.jpg","credit_id":"5da17b41e860170017ac90e2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1929848,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ravi Kiran Ayyagari","original_name":"Ravi Kiran Ayyagari","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60174a6fd96c3c0041102468","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14210760","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7iZNmFqoSsZARBdzUzZSujgRL0F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hi","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"ASHWATTHAMA Trailer | Filmfest München","key":"Kvd1pWp1BLw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-06-11T08:58:37.000Z","id":"61479893a579f90029170c5e"}]}}}
