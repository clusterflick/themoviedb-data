Using various methods of \"painting over\" or projecting on top of Giorgione's \"Sleeping Venus,\" Boettcher alienates the work artistically. Venus' beauty is seen within a new context and is thereby newly interpreted through the eyes of STRAWALDE. The assorted landscapes behind Venus range from idyllic pastorales to morbid backgrounds. STRAWALDE's art knows no boundaries and makes a strong impression on the viewer with bizarre sound collages.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/tHf1O99Q4odH0Y4pHGbqLkVq1Qc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72750,"logo_path":"/nvDTUVfgu0KEDs8wuod74e6sLM6.png","name":"DEFA-Studio für Wochenschau und Dokumentarfilme","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"}],"release_date":"1981-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Venus nach Giorgione","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174652,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jürgen Böttcher","original_name":"Jürgen Böttcher","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zzgq3s7shKd6zIabGIIG3s7afxq.jpg","credit_id":"65ddcd453ff2df01870b65dc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174652,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jürgen Böttcher","original_name":"Jürgen Böttcher","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zzgq3s7shKd6zIabGIIG3s7afxq.jpg","credit_id":"65ddcd4ca894d601640c7218","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38196,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Thomas Plenert","original_name":"Thomas Plenert","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ddcd5489d97f017c993cc6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174652,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jürgen Böttcher","original_name":"Jürgen Böttcher","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zzgq3s7shKd6zIabGIIG3s7afxq.jpg","credit_id":"5a022fa792514111f9000cc3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0417230","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.738,"height":813,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tHf1O99Q4odH0Y4pHGbqLkVq1Qc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1078,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s7xQz1e9y5ME2Xq6oxxTUTgy1kn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":718}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
