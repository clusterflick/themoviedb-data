Due to the Allies’ bombing and Resistants’ attacks, the railway was in such bad shape that the journey across France took 57 days. The deportees even had to walk at some occasions and were seen by several eye witnesses. The journey ended in Dachau and more than half of the deportees never came back.\r This story is unique, because of the incredibly long voyage that made many people witness the deportations towards German camps, usually made « invisible ». The film, based on the eye witnesses’ evidence and on the deportees’ own letters, ask us, « What would we have done in a similar situation today ? ».","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lettres du train fantôme","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0944957","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
