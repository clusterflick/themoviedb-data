The glassy facades of this city’s skyscrapers reflecting the passing by people of its diverse districts, shown in the reflection of distorted mirrors, symbolically depict the Spirit of a metropolis, as if it lives in its own shadows and reflections.  This distorted reflection of Tehran comes together with modern verses of a poet who was known as the Poet of Tehran after publishing his illustrious cycle of poems about Tehran in the 60s. As a flâneur, the poet himself saunters around this city -through his voice/poem/memory- reflecting upon the reflections of old/modern monuments, sculptures, statues etc. of this giant metropolis.","popularity":0.0646,"poster_path":"/iDVa5A8juow0lC5vhROeXcdF6P5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97091,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cultrual & Art Organization of Tehran","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2012-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"a documentary about a city","title":"Tehran, A Conceptual Art","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1316494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohammad Ali Sepanlou","original_name":"Mohammad Ali Sepanlou","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":"/u6pEEhF4zagB4C8O4jBuCCX6dZQ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"61255006c439c0007e5b961e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174326,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mohammad Reza Aslani","original_name":"Mohammad Reza Aslani","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/a9gh7AqnUaBnzuQJhsGFHpGCCEE.jpg","credit_id":"5a034863c3a368639101e48e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174326,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mohammad Reza Aslani","original_name":"Mohammad Reza Aslani","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/a9gh7AqnUaBnzuQJhsGFHpGCCEE.jpg","credit_id":"5a03486992514111da01e5f2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2130234","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iDVa5A8juow0lC5vhROeXcdF6P5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fa","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
