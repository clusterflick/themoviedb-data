This is a disoriented horror movie or the unsorted memories from a traumatized camera.","popularity":0.1171,"poster_path":"/tUBa3s6AMfarPgPsVbkPkbGK465.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seven Days in the Woods","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2685498,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Larsson","original_name":"Peter Larsson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6786856cababbba040bba31a","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4323103,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Rasmus R Streith","original_name":"Rasmus R Streith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678685b7601acfe7bd4f84ce","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2685498,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Larsson","original_name":"Peter Larsson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67868d8b2b1e40e83fbb15c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5179250,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Karlsson","original_name":"Daniel Karlsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67868dc178cfcd77ed4f1328","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tUBa3s6AMfarPgPsVbkPkbGK465.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":2481,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oVjaSMBYC1kmDGazOz3Zz5X1uFo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1772}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"2010 Uppsala International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2010-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
