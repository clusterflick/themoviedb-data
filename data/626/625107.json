At night he dreams of the capital. The next day he leaves his country home to see his fortune in London. He fails to find work at first and is almost starving when a wealthy sea-merchant takes him in as a cook's help. The cook takes an instant dislike to him and tortures him mercilessly. His garret is full of rats and he often goes without food. One day, a man on the street takes him for a beer and gives him a coin, which he uses to buy a cat.","popularity":0.1104,"poster_path":"/gdIvLaisKeLI7wjXvT95JGdwbH3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26305,"logo_path":null,"name":"Solax Film Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dick Whittington and His Cat","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1691357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vinnie Burns","original_name":"Vinnie Burns","popularity":0.0418,"profile_path":"/fPQmJ38qNxz6AaUbacmbJrCZdET.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dick","credit_id":"5d5d9f47202e11001892ca8d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2088861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Audrey Berry","original_name":"Audrey Berry","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"The Child","credit_id":"5d5d9f4da3d02700160c16ab","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1071403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alice Guy-Blaché","original_name":"Alice Guy-Blaché","popularity":0.2645,"profile_path":"/y1atPvIVDpS2pJR2rnQZ4VR7ULM.jpg","credit_id":"5d5d9f34a3d0277fe50a915f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1071403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alice Guy-Blaché","original_name":"Alice Guy-Blaché","popularity":0.2645,"profile_path":"/y1atPvIVDpS2pJR2rnQZ4VR7ULM.jpg","credit_id":"5d5d9f2e202e11001892ca7a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0207409","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1112,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c3fKXMxfZSwMJi0JYKBLQEo1qT2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":741},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gdIvLaisKeLI7wjXvT95JGdwbH3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1913-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
