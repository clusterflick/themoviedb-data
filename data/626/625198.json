Both elude him, and after clerking for two years, Homer returns home for a vacation. Impressed by his flashy clothes, the townspeople assume that Homer has achieved success. Attempting to win Rachel Prouty from his rival, Arthur Machim, Homer continues the deception by announcing that his employer, Kort and Bailly, has dispatched him to enroll stockholders for a proposed new plant to be built in Mainsville. Machim discovers the sham and denounces Homer as a crook.","popularity":0.1597,"poster_path":"/exUyp1WAmZfZ3r8FociU0UlIrzI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31782,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thomas H.
