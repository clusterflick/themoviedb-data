Headwinds arise as critics get offended by the claims that Eryn is being declared a living literary legend. The storm gathers force as the assaults gravitate from bad reviews to a fake-memoir designed to obliterate her from the field. Through the noise, Eryn attempts to write her way out of the public fray, and reclaim her voice in the minds of her readers. Along the way, she hopes to prove a happy ending is not always a bad thing.","popularity":1.3696,"poster_path":"/tpwsbzvSVgzXkxcOC1HLDhOOj4Z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Creatress","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":53122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fran Drescher","original_name":"Fran Drescher","popularity":1.5803,"profile_path":"/kQzvZ4ksLunfs3QZQtzRhzLJPBY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Carrie Robards","credit_id":"5d626f787f6c8d0016ee34d2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39012,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Bogdanovich","original_name":"Peter Bogdanovich","popularity":0.8766,"profile_path":"/m3aMMYzzEbqKEwGOyEPq7Rt1gAj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Theo Mencken","credit_id":"5d626f896dea3a746b946e39","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":51936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lindy Booth","original_name":"Lindy Booth","popularity":0.9151,"profile_path":"/5vT2mIIGTM7XQx4utAyRjW1aRPW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Eryn Bellow","credit_id":"5d651850bcf8c944db7613cb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":109858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kayla Ewell","original_name":"Kayla Ewell","popularity":0.7229,"profile_path":"/erWiC1tRwFvPbj0KivUQk0Of9Xx.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lacey","credit_id":"5d651869813cb60013f9bc2f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dante Basco","original_name":"Dante Basco","popularity":0.9779,"profile_path":"/2bfQho7MEo4wAQTmC687FkXUoKU.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Franklin","credit_id":"5d651881bcf8c944db7613e2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2777681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brianni Walker","original_name":"Brianni Walker","popularity":0.1443,"profile_path":"/W7x7g0N8nkpGeYKUmuYhWxUEnW.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Girl with backpack (uncredited)","credit_id":"625f21d6d1a893005172e8f6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1445513,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mario Aguja","original_name":"Mario Aguja","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Delivery Person (uncredited)","credit_id":"6386e01fcb802800813a4305","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1445513,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mario Aguja","original_name":"Mario Aguja","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639555cfa1a9ba00872f5b99","department":"Directing","job":"Script Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1445513,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mario Aguja","original_name":"Mario Aguja","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639555dad05a03007d58c259","department":"Directing","job":"Continuity"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1672389,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Barbara Anne Klein","original_name":"Barbara Anne Klein","popularity":0.1492,"profile_path":"/t1hAd96oiNpFfEXl6oB9knfjYzX.jpg","credit_id":"643c204946aed4051c4fb35a","department":"Crew","job":"Stunts"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2394702,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jason Cook","original_name":"Jason Cook","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6112e46dea3a001493c4a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7203052","wikidata_id":"Q104876289","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zWJIQYimxP7feFWGiISPNtQYvQ8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tpwsbzvSVgzXkxcOC1HLDhOOj4Z.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vr5WtS0vtHLekTOU6A3DeJ3tThp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tAGginMqbZMKXmC2EIw9MQB2Ije.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yU5fWjEAwqLsGq0qJiz6rhFGOAJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c8fgnCIxSToXzR5zwCemDmfguMG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2EyWWzbPKiU4nrhATF4xjgYHO5k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"THE CREATRESS -
