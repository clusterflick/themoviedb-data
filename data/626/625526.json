Mark Cousins – who left Belfast at 18 – returns to his hometown to reflect on how the place and its history have been used and occasionally abused by cinema. He traces how the legacy of division has impacted on the nation’s cinematic imagination; and, in a city that once had one of the highest rates of movie-going in the UK, he scrambles around the ruins of Belfast’s once-grand cinemas.","popularity":0.1349,"poster_path":"/jTkL5DrvgCtLQ0od06bmrJ27kyA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25055,"logo_path":"/eyNIfbCskdzFRfHIDdzgOmRMjbW.png","name":"DoubleBand Films","origin_country":"XI"},{"id":6705,"logo_path":"/iNB1FCwT4XjO6wkN3PnpPnwr9GX.png","name":"Film4 Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"50 Years of the Troubles: A Journey Through Film","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1061561,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Cousins","original_name":"Mark Cousins","popularity":0.1609,"profile_path":"/f5B9kcpJXLETRYwRZJmvKmiWfLu.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d602711ea37e00012760c1f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1889,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Holmes","original_name":"David Holmes","popularity":0.2898,"profile_path":"/fT30VY0itg2AYj11uOm15Nd6kWr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d6c497765686e3c12884779","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1991008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurence McKeown","original_name":"Laurence McKeown","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d6c498665686e6d7d88b077","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1286614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian Henry Martin","original_name":"Brian Henry Martin","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6026f4924ce52305149a18","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11424698","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jTkL5DrvgCtLQ0od06bmrJ27kyA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
