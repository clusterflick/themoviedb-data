By employing visually impressive shots, the film establishes a signature spatial and temporal narrative, at the same time entering the space of fusion of personal and collective memory and dismemory, which, in the context of political and economic changes that have been occurring in Croatian society for the past several decades, acquire metaphorical and symbolic meanings, imbued with powerful socio-psychological implications.","popularity":0.0954,"poster_path":"/pwRc3bAxWsxjQlo7TvF2rLUrtJm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95508,"logo_path":null,"name":"Udruga REA","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2019-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yet Another Departure","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1831014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dajana Čuljak","original_name":"Dajana Čuljak","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5d910fad109cd0000f4557b3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1895805,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Renata Poljak","original_name":"Renata Poljak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d5df5cf4a52f80014d98df8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1496451,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boris Poljak","original_name":"Boris Poljak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d910fc1ec1879000ed60f9b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1496907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Damir Čučić","original_name":"Damir Čučić","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d910fcc109cd0000f4557c5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2421600,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Silvio Belušić","original_name":"Silvio Belušić","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d910fe0ec18790018d627bb","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1922368,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alen Sinkauz","original_name":"Alen Sinkauz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d910feb109cd00021452732","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1898619,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nenad Sinkauz","original_name":"Nenad Sinkauz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d910ff5172d7f001f591047","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1895805,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Renata Poljak","original_name":"Renata Poljak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e146fd5d8af670012c17e99","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11095464","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1260,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pwRc3bAxWsxjQlo7TvF2rLUrtJm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":840}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Oberhausen festival","release_date":"2019-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
