An arrival in the cinematic tradition of 1920s avantgarde, with the railway and industrial modernity as a favourite graphical motif, which takes him past a fish market and a strange procession, and finally home to a small family, where the grandparents drink tea, smoke cigarettes and chat cheerfully. The image of a young woman burns itself onto the celluloid - and into the filmmaker's consciousness.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/sLXYV7TrFkPlFt7veYlxtuVXlDh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83012,"logo_path":null,"name":"If You Hold a Stone","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Winter of Zeljka","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2013679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Željka Suková","original_name":"Željka Suková","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f4ab3d865e0a200324c27e1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1286332,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lucas Barbi","original_name":"Lucas Barbi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/a9SkAQnj66PWD98OY5Y1Wv5GHsM.jpg","credit_id":"624524933af9290090bfaeae","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1161064,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gustavo Beck","original_name":"Gustavo Beck","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":"/lkNN3nFNZIw85VEK2bWwNSWvHbc.jpg","credit_id":"5d5ffb18ea37e06c7d75daa9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3401860","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sLXYV7TrFkPlFt7veYlxtuVXlDh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
