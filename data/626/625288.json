Sir Georg Solti conducts the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus in a magnificent performance of Berliozs concert cantata. This feast of Berlioz launched Soltis farewell tour with the orchestra he had directed for twenty years and was described by The Times as the unsurpassable culmination of two decades of music-making...one that summarised all that has been most admirable about Soltis long reign in Chicago.  Like reading the book by flashes of lightning was how one writer described the relationship of Berlioz to Goethe in this Dramatic Legend, his way of shaping twenty scenes selected from the story into a narrative in four parts. Though it has sometimes been staged, the works drama is to be found within the music itself, which illuminates the incidents with what the conductor Sir Thomas Beecham once called a bunch of the loveliest tunes in existence.","popularity":0.1986,"poster_path":"/eQKygqB1Avj5GIJPtcQ2kEq25CV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":133,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Damnation of Faust","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1338565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Sofie von Otter","original_name":"Anne Sofie von Otter","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":"/uXD0zu2hmutgGX7veVbjbROMLrb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Marguerite (mezzosoprano)","credit_id":"5d5eab4ff263ba2ba5944c14","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Lewis","original_name":"Keith Lewis","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Faust (tenor)","credit_id":"5d5eab6f69d2807b2c001e52","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José van Dam","original_name":"José van Dam","popularity":0.1477,"profile_path":"/ogj5ITifaFJeg89UY4WDIu5sUTr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mephistopheles (baritono)","credit_id":"5d5eab87a894d600149b1479","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1431555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Rose","original_name":"Peter Rose","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Brander (basso)","credit_id":"5d5eaba5a894d600129b1cd2","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1234023,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Georg Solti","original_name":"Georg Solti","popularity":0.1113,"profile_path":"/aeGFb8BBQq8jIywJPpJJBaWF1EN.jpg","credit_id":"5d5eabc7a894d657449a8ed0","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":550671,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodney Greenberg","original_name":"Rodney Greenberg","popularity":0.1476,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d5eabdaf263ba001694f0bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1365812,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hector Berlioz","original_name":"Hector Berlioz","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/uXu4EJxHhOkz8NqtnBAAwx8CLLG.jpg","credit_id":"5dbc58e654f6eb00154f2f38","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1655392,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Almire Gandonnière","original_name":"Almire Gandonnière","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dbc590ad388ae0016d7eee8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1365812,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hector Berlioz","original_name":"Hector Berlioz","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/uXu4EJxHhOkz8NqtnBAAwx8CLLG.jpg","credit_id":"5dbc5921d2c0c100161fe1ac","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oO4otg88sNSJp1vmAtn9dtsV6Gx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1365}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eQKygqB1Avj5GIJPtcQ2kEq25CV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
