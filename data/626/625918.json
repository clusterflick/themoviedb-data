Jeff's young wife did not survive the accident, and unable to bare the pain of his loss, Jeff becomes a religious lunatic who projects his delusions onto Lily and makes her life a living hell. Looking for an escape, Lily becomes a well known burlesque dancer, losing herself nightly in a world of mystery and passion. Her life seems perfect and carefree, but the physical and emotional abuse she suffers makes it nearly impossible for her to have any kind of personal relationships with men. Everything changes when she meets Nate, a fiery young police officer with a troubled childhood that he can't forget. They fall into an affair that spins out of control, as everything they once believed in beings to change... Will they choose faith or fear?","popularity":0.7912,"poster_path":"/dsOT6Cjcjtnk3doJpWEU8WBEtq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trust Me","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2257376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paulina Michaels","original_name":"Paulina Michaels","popularity":0.085,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Lily","credit_id":"5d6297016dea3a00119581ab","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2027597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isaac Harrison","original_name":"Isaac Harrison","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/57PlGK9ef9YH8jK8VgEIkw6Wobn.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Nate","credit_id":"5d62972b39a45d0014c06294","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":201355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Anthony Samuel","original_name":"Marc Anthony Samuel","popularity":0.165,"profile_path":"/1CwbfWZq42VJgV5BDkNn9c2WTn0.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ray","credit_id":"5d62974f7f6c8d4476ec4d06","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Roberts","original_name":"Eric Roberts","popularity":3.0557,"profile_path":"/NiWg1TaUcal7xn1ZQeyA2dLd5F.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jeff","credit_id":"5d629782bc8abc176c251d03","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2395628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lyman Johnson","original_name":"Lyman Johnson","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Young Jeff","credit_id":"5d6297a839a45d0012c06790","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2395630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bo Youngblood","original_name":"Bo Youngblood","popularity":0.2325,"profile_path":"/lfrJdlBhJns0otqQI19p3O5Vv6q.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Helen","credit_id":"5d6297c739a45d0013c065e2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2395632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karsen Rigby","original_name":"Karsen Rigby","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Katrina","credit_id":"5d6297e66dea3a7aa3938788","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1379122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zackary Arthur","original_name":"Zackary Arthur","popularity":1.1332,"profile_path":"/x7tVHHzKkc5fl1KpEASiQTBtYs6.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Little Nate","credit_id":"5d629807bc8abc176e251bf0","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3571519,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pete Pepe","original_name":"Pete Pepe","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6296a0c81e92250064195fbe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2240004,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lucas Lechowski","original_name":"Lucas Lechowski","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6296a0d9d48cee0d70733346","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1650645,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Thor Wixom","original_name":"Thor Wixom","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":"/keBTNzbqWahIXI7FONaUNkKAyai.jpg","credit_id":"6296a107fd140b005117bde4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2636770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Brea","original_name":"Daniel Brea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6296a11c0f21c6153732aff3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3471690,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jade Puga","original_name":"Jade Puga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6296a139d71fb400a6b7ffd4","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2257376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paulina Michaels","original_name":"Paulina Michaels","popularity":0.085,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6296e76dea3a001195819c","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3547358","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dsOT6Cjcjtnk3doJpWEU8WBEtq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5707,"name":"childhood trauma"},{"id":207691,"name":"abuse"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
