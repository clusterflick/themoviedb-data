Beyond Men and Masculinity explores how men see themselves, how they relate to the people they say they care about and how the personal impacts the political.  What happens when men are taught to disconnect from their feelings in the name of being strong and independent? What is the link between shame and male violence? Why do we find it hard to value kindness and compassion in men? And what role do women play in defining what is expected from men and masculinity?  A discussion of these sometimes uncomfortable questions is now more crucial than ever. From the therapy room to the political battlefield, this provocative film offers a clear insight into why we must look beyond traditional definitions of men and masculinity.","popularity":0.0759,"poster_path":"/hN0wOeBajsfhLs36AledOQHboY8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":146877,"logo_path":"/xdxXUXaOlu9HRJk4cQfZvmPeYfM.png","name":"Sideways Film","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond Men and Masculinity","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2915882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Gabbay","original_name":"Alex Gabbay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639d0f50be6d880084eab68b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23463762","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"futureishumane","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":2.5,"height":250,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4nvzrVIP5yMoYc1uGbPjOtn4UVP.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":625}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hN0wOeBajsfhLs36AledOQHboY8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":535}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Netflix","release_date":"2020-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Beyond Men and Masculinity trailer","key":"514648887","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-02-20T13:39:43.000Z","id":"639d124df12cf400ba45f6e2"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Beyond Men and Masculinity Trailer","key":"z0iBCmqDNT8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-02-14T17:40:32.000Z","id":"639d1276f12cf400911291f8"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Beyond Men and Masculinity - Trailer","key":"479796142","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-11-16T11:04:52.000Z","id":"64f8b512ffc9de00e13372d0"}]}}}
