It begins with an ascent of Mount Carmel upon which the Druze towns of Dalyet el Carmel and Isfiya are located, drawing the viewer into a world of geographic isolation and a locale shaped by coercion and control. Living mostly in mountainous areas in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Palestine/Israel, as well as in diaspora globally, the Druze maintain close-knit social and religious ties as a minority within and across national borders.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/xMZY4PKclqmme1f2xF1NSn8FUqw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We No Longer Prefer Mountains","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1778382,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Inas Halabi","original_name":"Inas Halabi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639de8c2f12cf4007ac7b6c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27481012","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1412,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xMZY4PKclqmme1f2xF1NSn8FUqw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hot Docs Festival","release_date":"2023-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"The Show Room","release_date":"2022-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
