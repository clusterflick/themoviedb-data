He’s going back to living the single life of a gay Tel Avivian as an unemployed. At Purim party, he meets Idan (27yo), a well-known gay icon, a successful photographer, a bold guy who doesn’t mince words. They enter into a sort of undefined romantic relationship. In a new reality, when the entire economy and country is paralyzed, the world stops for a moment.
