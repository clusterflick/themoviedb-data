Mitchâ€™s professionalism is tested by his erratic nature and ongoing struggles with a mental health condition. While Connor is bright, confident and well liked, he has anxiety about his place in the world as a person living with Down syndrome. The film explores the nuances of their relationship, which is at once transactional and yet a genuine friendship.","popularity":0.0976,"poster_path":"/slUtUfUI2tkdm6ghQYpP17Vp4s0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94007,"logo_path":null,"name":"Victorian College of the Arts","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2022-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441318,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Johnston","original_name":"Will Johnston","popularity":0.0499,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Mitch","credit_id":"639f0bac688cd0008c5ee914","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3835872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Buster Murphy","original_name":"Buster Murphy","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Connor","credit_id":"639f0bbc8ddc3414aa019649","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":75181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edwina Wren","original_name":"Edwina Wren","popularity":0.1235,"profile_path":"/iMfeQvttnthKT1H1LKOKNoAZHMS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"639f0bcc9bcd0f283a3dc0a7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3785264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tegan Bowden","original_name":"Tegan Bowden","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"639f0bd62f3b170085db885c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3835873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isaac Wicks","original_name":"Isaac Wicks","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"639f0bdc8ddc34150ee0a717","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3835874,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oliver Wicks","original_name":"Oliver Wicks","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639f0be88ddc3414969bb17b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3206495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cameron Dunlop","original_name":"Cameron Dunlop","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/uSH5Hv9uh827ZPf58WFPMfrUuTY.jpg","credit_id":"639f0c089bcd0f27c9c2b853","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3835874,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oliver Wicks","original_name":"Oliver Wicks","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639f0c202f3b1700e6d989d5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3835874,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oliver Wicks","original_name":"Oliver Wicks","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639f0c2a688cd00084ce6a09","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3835878,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brad Vaughan","original_name":"Brad Vaughan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639f0c5b2f3b1700e6d98a02","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3835879,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samara Lucich","original_name":"Samara Lucich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639f0c7c4f33ad008c00526b","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3835880,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joseph Buchan","original_name":"Joseph Buchan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639f0c91223e2000a8b47fcf","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3835881,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Rose Morgan","original_name":"Rose Morgan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639f0ca0be6d8800a2c1e7a5","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/slUtUfUI2tkdm6ghQYpP17Vp4s0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1196}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
