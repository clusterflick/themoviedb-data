Animation and found footage create a powerful montage that evokes the atmosphere in women's prisons--the violations as well as the hope and courage of prison activists who fight quietly, and from the inside.  As well as documenting the experience of many women including Patti Contrerras, Blind Eye To Justice educates audiences by providing an overview of the issues of human rights for HIV+ women caught in the criminal justice system.","popularity":0.1281,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blind Eye to Justice: HIV+ Women Incarcerated in California","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":938972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Davis","original_name":"Angela Davis","popularity":0.3221,"profile_path":"/rCGiP5iycqFodkrxslZl19IsIcf.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"639f49b3223e2000c981749d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":168103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carol Leigh","original_name":"Carol Leigh","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639f49c82f3b170085dba2e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
