The time that an idea takes to be born in our mind. The time that a fleeting hallucination lasts. This hallucination is that of Neanderthal man who thinks he sees, at the moment his mate was giving birth, a baby from the modern world, erasing for a fleeting second the slow evolution of the species. Immediately after, the mind of the primitive man goes on a imaginary time travel trip that takes him to... 1960. The father tries to get in touch with his son, reincarnated as a 40-year old man, an ordinary man... or almost.","popularity":0.2455,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1984-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ADN","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Pierre Delamour","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Delamour","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"639d3599be6d88007f17041a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Étienne Bierry","original_name":"Étienne Bierry","popularity":0.0668,"profile_path":"/mXEdhcN563xDdC9qDiLN9lrZycZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"639d35bc2f3b1700ba03035a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1802751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"François Michaux","original_name":"François Michaux","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"639d35f59bcd0f008c51a50d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3834126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Bellet","original_name":"Olga Bellet","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"639d364ff12cf4009112a5c5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3834127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Wuillman","original_name":"Jonathan Wuillman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"639d3674b5400200b06804d4","order":4},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1545081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brigitte Lahaie","original_name":"Brigitte Lahaie","popularity":266.357,"profile_path":"/b3CBMBsDsKzHb56eb1pWFdfuDTV.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"64581d1cfe077a01398c231b","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3834129,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Serge da Silva","original_name":"Serge da Silva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639d3709fd7aa400e07b1c63","department":"Crew","job":"Special Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3834128,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ali Borgini","original_name":"Ali Borgini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639d36b4fd7aa4007f7c5a8a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":997,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Thierry Arbogast","original_name":"Thierry Arbogast","popularity":6.434,"profile_path":"/mBbeGwG9rHRh3b61XzchPEG4gp1.jpg","credit_id":"639d36d0be6d880084eace81","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
