The story concerns the opera singer Floria Tosca who tries to save her lover, the painter Mario Cavaradossi, from the brutal chief of police, Scarpia. Through-composed and expertly orchestrated it contains some of Puccini’s best-known lyrical arias and remains one of his most performed operas. In this 2022 production, an eminent cast is directed by the acclaimed Australian director Barrie Kosky – ‘the Amsterdam audience was completely swept off its feet by Kosky’s stunning production’ (Opera News).","popularity":0.1086,"poster_path":"/oEwM8U2KNwAuIXsQGFMYjMcuJy4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tosca","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1566561,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malin Byström","original_name":"Malin Byström","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Floria Tosca","credit_id":"639df039b5400200961d1d89","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1695206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joshua Guerrero","original_name":"Joshua Guerrero","popularity":0.2329,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mario Cavaradossi","credit_id":"639df05df12cf400cd6fd290","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2225969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gevorg Hakobyan","original_name":"Gevorg Hakobyan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Il barone Scarpia","credit_id":"639df079be6d8800a2c1697f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638622,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martijn Sanders","original_name":"Martijn Sanders","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Cesare Angelotti","credit_id":"639df093b5400200e180b634","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donato Di Stefano","original_name":"Donato Di Stefano","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Il Sagrestano","credit_id":"639df0adbe6d8800a2c1699f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2700423,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucas van Lierop","original_name":"Lucas van Lierop","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Spoletta","credit_id":"639df0c42f3b1700a00fc364","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1682904,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barrie Kosky","original_name":"Barrie Kosky","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639df0d7b5400200e180b653","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3245864,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lorenzo Viotti","original_name":"Lorenzo Viotti","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639df0ee9bcd0f00b4e92a5c","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/crq3seLOl3CDV2SQKvGQB6VplI3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fKV2hIbNAGMYgdxzUtPsxJVW4DW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6tJ19pI6YclBzCZAICTTd5TuE7G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/oEwM8U2KNwAuIXsQGFMYjMcuJy4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1272,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eSYHPLw2ZFsuaEnljr45fkHyPax.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":848}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Lorenzo Viotti about Puccini's masterpiece Tosca | Dutch National Opera","key":"JFsxaKommCs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-04-12T17:28:56.000Z","id":"66a58ffa17aa3b8924dad999"}]}}}
