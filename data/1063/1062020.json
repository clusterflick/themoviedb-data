Singing gracefully and joyfully, her little colleagues lay the drops of dew that feed the trees they have to preserve, but Pwet just can’t seem to do it. Worse, the single, stunted leaf she finally manages to germinate flies away in a gust of wind. This is the beginning of a long journey for Pwet, in search of her precious shoot. A wondrous adventure in the company of Tut Tut, an eccentric dandelion Mellow, with whom she finds friendship, a whole new world... and herself.","popularity":0.056,"poster_path":"/9hWWpz2o64HmKLbrDnXffMdgkil.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94452,"logo_path":null,"name":"SUPAMONKS","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"The Mellows","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3833087,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marlène Ranchon","original_name":"Marlène Ranchon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639c56329408ec00a8dcbacf","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1875090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niels Prayer","original_name":"Niels Prayer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639c56399408ec0083a335e0","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2528103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maïté Sonnet","original_name":"Maïté Sonnet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/ns2rMNPPjMtTOgqMyw4zmPUveX6.jpg","credit_id":"639c56429408ec007b5c6269","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3833089,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julien Bagnol-Roy","original_name":"Julien Bagnol-Roy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639c564a18864b00877b3fa4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1881296,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Valentine de Blignières","original_name":"Valentine de Blignières","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639c5651d2b2090094234fcf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9hWWpz2o64HmKLbrDnXffMdgkil.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
