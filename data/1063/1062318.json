This film concentrates on the politicking and lobbying that finally led to its patriation in 1982. Five prime ministers had failed before Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau took up the challenge in the early 1970s. Principal players in this documentary are federal Minister of Justice Jean Chrétien, Prime Minister Trudeau, 10 provincial premiers and a host of journalists, politicians, lawyers, and diplomats on both sides of the Atlantic.","popularity":0.2461,"poster_path":"/3ttdTxojaGbexiilGdsCURfc09m.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1982-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Road to Patriation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1249780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Maitland","original_name":"Alan Maitland","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"639d2421be6d8800a2c10f1f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1351515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Elliott Trudeau","original_name":"Pierre Elliott Trudeau","popularity":0.1504,"profile_path":"/tpdjMQT7fCrtCHoHojsddxDthZs.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"639d24bd2f3b170094c903b2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2125711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Chrétien","original_name":"Jean Chrétien","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/bPtrwCjOLWjPcFBETzv4lqi8PXO.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"639d24fdfd7aa400a25c5614","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1586614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert A.
