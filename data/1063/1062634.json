Next day, Oleg Karavaichuk took the footage and assembled film. It was first shown on April 1, 2009 in Gogol's birthday at a concert \"Diary of a Madman\" in Culture House \"Lensovet\"  in St. Petersburg. This film is not about Gogol, but is dedicated to him: in the intervals of playing the piano, the composer talks about the true roots of the writer's work, about the common fate of the greatest people of art, about the synthesis of music and literature, about eternity and paradoxes.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/34gSn8w2P9PTwhswZHxN0PhQejh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":188604,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bomba-Piter","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2009-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"«What is Gogol?
