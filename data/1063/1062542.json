Because there weren’t any. Karavaychuk’s eccentricity was too bewildering for the culture officials of that time, and he was practically banned from performing in public. He began to work at the Lenfilm Studio and write film music there. Recognition came to Karavaichuk only in the 2000s. It is summer 2015 and Oleg Karavaichuk gives his “Pure Music” concert. Half a year later he travels to Spain, where rehearses again. While there he meets with journalists and talks about how he senses the smell of death in the streets of ancient Pamplona.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/xdLKZQ0ciI63Za3EIVKOPJjNOKO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Karavaichuk.
