This is the question asked by Henrik Ibsen's drama Ghosts (Gengangere). Oswald Alving returns from a bohemian existence in Paris to small-town Norway. Encountering people who do not communicate, Oswald responds by becoming ironic and distant. He gradually learns more of the secrets that weigh on his family, as well as those inside himself. His mother, Mrs Alving, welcomes her much-missed son home - and slowly understands what, or whom, he has brought home with him. Together with the young, critically acclaimed choreographer Cina Espejord, she retells Ibsen's play as a ballet. The pair feel the story is suited to dance because both it's inner and outer brutality can be pitted against the power of dance. Ibsen's Ghosts is an evocative production in a modern dance style. Nils Petter Molvær has composed new music, which he performs on-stage together with Jan Bang.","popularity":0.2648,"poster_path":"/n0Kv8NNlu8YBvrGqVd1QlfQnAgL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":179295,"logo_path":"/beF0jVLbIPewobC4FpyY7co7TPu.png","name":"BelAir Media","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":188616,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Norwegian Opera & Ballet","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ibsen's Ghosts","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3001620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melissa Hough","original_name":"Melissa Hough","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Mrs Alving","credit_id":"639e7fd3688cd000a9ee40e0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3835443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Currell","original_name":"Philip Currell","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Pastor Manders","credit_id":"639e80014f33ad0084559c2f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3835452,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natasha Jones Dale","original_name":"Natasha Jones Dale","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Young Mrs Alving","credit_id":"639e811d8ddc3400c6a90cc5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3835453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Olofsson","original_name":"Jonathan Olofsson","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Young Pastor Manders","credit_id":"639e81319bcd0f27f044483e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1010048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Håkon Ramstad","original_name":"Håkon Ramstad","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"","credit_id":"639e8225688cd000935d0c65","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3835461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nils Petter Molvær","original_name":"Nils Petter Molvær","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"","credit_id":"639e824fbe6d8800bca7a27e","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2240953,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marit Moum Aune","original_name":"Marit Moum Aune","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639e7e07f12cf4007ac7ee28","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3835437,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Even Børsum","original_name":"Even Børsum","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639e7e81f12cf40091132b6e","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1421949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nils Petter Molvær","original_name":"Nils Petter Molvær","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639e7e60223e2000a8b43830","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2240953,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marit Moum Aune","original_name":"Marit Moum Aune","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639e7e25be6d8800d9cc5276","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3196637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ingrid Nylander","original_name":"Ingrid Nylander","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639e7e98be6d88008caf85a8","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3835435,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cina Espejord","original_name":"Cina Espejord","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639e7e3cbe6d88007f178351","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3835439,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Kristin Bredal","original_name":"Kristin Bredal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"639e7ebb223e20008359a4d6","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":848,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n0Kv8NNlu8YBvrGqVd1QlfQnAgL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nTVTeasRlkjQeQLCNiQzm9mBmzz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rFOYurkovNeqKz2ByHYsZKgiU0I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1346,"name":"dance performance"},{"id":235168,"name":"contemporary dance"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"no","note":"","release_date":"2017-02-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
