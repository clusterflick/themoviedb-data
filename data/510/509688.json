Max is 61. He has a lot of sex. Sex with clients. Sex with 'leather friends'. Sex with Dima, his younger Ukrainian boyfriend. Even sex with his old friend Jan. Everyone comes to Max's Kreuzberg playroom. Luckily, Max was once a lieutenant colonel in the German army, so he's good at ordering his life.
