Each guest there has one, a past, a conflict, as well as hope. Set in a hotel over the course of 24 hours, 'Checking In', tells five stories, each allowing us an insight into some of these guests.

These are just some of the stories you will find when you 'check in'.","popularity":0.0614,"poster_path":"/38GR5tUw7f32kKrFzi28mdOcOKn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Checking In","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1803463,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Hastings","original_name":"David Hastings","popularity":0.0803,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9f5c6dc3a3680a3000bf4e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1803464,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kaushy Patel","original_name":"Kaushy Patel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9f5c7ec3a3680a2700a944","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1986724,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Adams","original_name":"Mark Adams","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/btanoQAmsOJqgUd1DdtFdLNzxy4.jpg","credit_id":"5a9f5c3bc3a3680a1900adbc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1803466,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Troy Dennison","original_name":"Troy Dennison","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9f5c4fc3a3680a3000bf2a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1992025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leah Solmaz","original_name":"Leah Solmaz","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9f5c8a0e0a2641d400b842","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1803462,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rebecca Harris-Smith","original_name":"Rebecca Harris-Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9f5c610e0a2641cb00ab14","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2360424","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/38GR5tUw7f32kKrFzi28mdOcOKn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":706}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
