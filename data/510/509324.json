Strangers pulled him to safety, giving him a second chance at life and propelling him on a global journey to explore the limits of body, mind, spirit and art. Spanning Germany, Canada, Japan, Kenya, and the United States, Fox's journey includes collaborations with Canadian First-Nations artist Rande Cook and African-American artist Zulu, who help him memorialize his experiences in a full back tattoo. In our digital age where personal confession and self-exposure abound, Fox instead transforms his experiences into art, making a film that is both innovative and accessible.","popularity":0.0731,"poster_path":"/vJzYbh380XqTNQdubZhI0HRR4Ib.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Skin I'm In","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1434736,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Broderick Fox","original_name":"Broderick Fox","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9cfb70c3a3680b57042285","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2099763","wikidata_id":"Q17012258","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vJzYbh380XqTNQdubZhI0HRR4Ib.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
