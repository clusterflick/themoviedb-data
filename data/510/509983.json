A Noble Revolution aims to decipher the historical dimension of one of the most prominent personality of the Italian political movement for civil rights of the last forty years, Marcella Di Folco, leader of the MIT (Transsexual Identity Movement). The reconstruction of the film, however, does not want to be objective, but done through the filter of an intimate relationship, that one between the director himself and protagonist.","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":"/7OM0pUqrYRE7f8o1f7YZjW1WZ4e.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2014-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Una nobile rivoluzione","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1992795,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simone Cangelosi","original_name":"Simone Cangelosi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa09dacc3a3683fa800249f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4357602","wikidata_id":"Q29034252","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zpvamYSsM8yUMDUyjWBCCwefS48.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7OM0pUqrYRE7f8o1f7YZjW1WZ4e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Archivio Aperto","release_date":"2020-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
