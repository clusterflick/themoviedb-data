In 2012, forty-three years later, History doesn't have to repeat itself is an attempt to find the community born from these riots and how the wide project of transformation that inspired this movement is being continued and transmitted. Seven conversations about the politics of sexual minorities and the fight against the AIDS epidemic are combined in order to present their various perspectives, experiments and ideals. Their projects include archiving, video, activism and the creation of community spaces. They share a deep desire for justice which travels across decades : they have learned the lessons of the past and look now towards the future, craving utopia.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/zQalivh5u1yx82E0MQK96KDyQL5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"History Doesn't Have to Repeat Itself","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Rien n'oblige à répéter l'histoire","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1992089,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stéphane Gérard","original_name":"Stéphane Gérard","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9f8f6d925141581e00d13e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3733072","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ixWa87yn18kuGi1Ly02hbhhUu0d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zQalivh5u1yx82E0MQK96KDyQL5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
