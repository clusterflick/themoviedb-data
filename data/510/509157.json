In relating their personal stories, these remarkable men and women take us back to the 1970's and 1980's, creating a vivid portrait of how a small, dedicated group tackled the seeming-impossible: the attainment of the world's first law that affirmatively recognized same-sex relationships. In doing so, they changed the very language that is used to describe same-sex relationships and created a template that spread worldwide. Their accomplishment made possible today's efforts to establish marriage equality. Their contribution is revealed in this stirring documentary.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/nLdAQWqkd2ivJ57XN9EvAJVQQhS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Citizen Change","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1990242,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Chambers","original_name":"James Chambers","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9bbc700e0a2630b803b787","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3198370","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nLdAQWqkd2ivJ57XN9EvAJVQQhS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
