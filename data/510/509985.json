One deep breath: this is what Maël might need to cope with his partner Adam's suicide, a tragic event that, apart from great sorrow, has caused him to have a physical breakdown. He is troubled by his doubts about his lover's last drastic act, by how he put an end to his life and to their difficult relationship. But his grief turns into anger when he discovers that Adam had a secret long-term relationship with a woman called Patricia: he digs deep into his own memories, recollecting past events and eventually meeting his rival. On her part, Patricia will have to face unexpected dangers. A claustrophobic melodrama, with an unstructured and evocative narrative style. Here, South African director Antony Hickling, 34, confirms his visionary talent and ability to adopt a fresh point of view on queer cinema. All the performers are strictly gay and transgender, including Manuel Blanc, who was once André Téchiné's muse.","popularity":0.1684,"poster_path":"/LvuTY4KgBnsbPKOvEtjsxdEKtM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143332,"logo_path":"/joWd59ceVDjk9SF5huy5HBcMgkr.png","name":"Optimale","origin_country":""},{"id":2298,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vivàsvan Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Love is a Danger Zone.
