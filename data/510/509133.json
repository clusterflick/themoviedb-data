Refusing to betray his own conscience, McNeill stood up to the man who became Pope Benedict XVI and would not be silenced. The Film depicts McNeill's remarkable journey: growing up in Buffalo, escaping death as a POW in Nazi Germany, falling in love with his husband, writing groundbreaking books, coming out on national television, calling for compassion and justice during the AIDS crisis, and celebrating the unique spiritual gifts of LGBT people. Theologians, journalists, activists, and LGBT religious figures, including openly gay Episcopal Bishop Gene Robinson, movingly testify to McNeill's influence and importance.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/3ENHhDYwI7vAtVTh7DIw5eLITLr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taking a Chance on God","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":218422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brendan Fay","original_name":"Brendan Fay","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9b96d392514128420293e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3511932,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dan Messina","original_name":"Dan Messina","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f83f2e6c3583c9759a2db9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":218422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brendan Fay","original_name":"Brendan Fay","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f83fb831775276d6d9c087","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2023719","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s2nwS4NbT6O73Ts6HznvlPjFm6O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3ENHhDYwI7vAtVTh7DIw5eLITLr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
