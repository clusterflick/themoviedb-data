Roland’s collage, ‘Cloud of Witnesses’, is comprised of thousands of photographic portraits, newspapers, and magazines cutouts, presenting an alternative visual history to empower the black community. The film explores collective representations of history, memory, and culture; where pasts, presents, and futures are modeled by the blending of imagination, facts, and love.","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":"/ywRHl8SZfbTiyIF7H0kop3JX8Zp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Give","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1991999,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David de Rozas","original_name":"David de Rozas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9f3bed9251414bd30035cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1991999,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David de Rozas","original_name":"David de Rozas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ada98df0e0a261432002957","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7391962","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.525,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ywRHl8SZfbTiyIF7H0kop3JX8Zp.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":630},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/betraK4niNsDMuyavAtggwV5ER.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer | Give | David de Rozas","key":"JpkzDELBpAQ","published_at":"2018-03-14T10:52:20.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5ada99c6c3a36862ef002a1b"}]}}}
