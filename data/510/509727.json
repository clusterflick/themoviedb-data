The French filmmaker Sylvie Ballyot was shooting a feminist documentary in Yemen when her tapes were requisitioned by the authorities. Adrift in unknown territory with the only help of a translator, Ballyot carried on, shooting images of herself in public spaces â€“the only woman in a crowd of men. Her reactions in a culture she is not familiar with get combined with interviews with students who talk about love, family, and sexuality.","popularity":0.4214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love and Words Are Politics","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":545256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sylvie Ballyot","original_name":"Sylvie Ballyot","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a9f1adf9251414bd30016a7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":545256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sylvie Ballyot","original_name":"Sylvie Ballyot","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9f1aee0e0a2632a00018f6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1017947","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2383,"name":"feminism"},{"id":187,"name":"islam"},{"id":173262,"name":"yemen"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
