Watching these evocative home movies, looking through photos and hearing the couple's stories, we are transported through the glorious and dreamy moments of a young, beautiful couple in love. But as the façade of those picture-perfect moments fades away, Aldo and Gabriella are forced to ruminate on the mistakes they've made and the people they no longer are. Adriana Loeff and Claudia Abend have crafted a heartfelt film about the power of love, the universality of heartbreak, and an inescapable truth: We all will grow old with less-than-perfect grace.","popularity":0.1294,"poster_path":"/v5WfiPewjahSvw1YJ9ECYezc3jl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2017-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Flor de la Vida","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1812607,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Claudia Abend","original_name":"Claudia Abend","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad5fcb39251415dc001597a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1812608,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adriana Loeff","original_name":"Adriana Loeff","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad5fcc1c3a3680c0f017bc8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6705596","wikidata_id":"Q60338050","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jj67tzTdJnmlbD0bRsDIcrWCeP6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v5WfiPewjahSvw1YJ9ECYezc3jl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":771}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"IDFA 2017 | Trailer | La flor de la vida","key":"ncD9793bJ_g","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-11-14T11:00:38.000Z","id":"634dec5e81a7fc0079fd4cae"}]}}}
