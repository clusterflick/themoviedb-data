Filmed over the course of nine years, Zoned In traces the remarkable real-life journey of 16-year-old Daniel from a Bronx high school to an Ivy League university while simultaneously exploring the role of race and class in the American education system. Narrated by Daniel himself, the movie celebrates the accomplishments of this extraordinary young man but does not shy away from depicting his struggles to fit in amongst the privileged students at his college and his candid questioning of a system that has allowed him to excel but has left so many of his friends and family members behind.","popularity":0.2463,"poster_path":"/3Jus3V2Jx7mKDxZzhhnhrBSsbyX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101816,"logo_path":null,"name":"Disruptive Element Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zoned In","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1992076,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniela Zanzotto","original_name":"Daniela Zanzotto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9f855b925141580c00c874","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1202581","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.525,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3Jus3V2Jx7mKDxZzhhnhrBSsbyX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":630}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6270,"name":"high school"},{"id":242,"name":"new york city"},{"id":3616,"name":"college"},{"id":2470,"name":"education"},{"id":11479,"name":"social commentary"},{"id":12425,"name":"racism"},{"id":161307,"name":"bronx, new york city"},{"id":233134,"name":"classism"},{"id":262228,"name":"observational documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
