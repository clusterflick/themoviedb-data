They reflect on each word, considering its conventional meaning and what it means to them personally. The resulting extraordinary five-year dialogue is by turns poignant, profound and funny. Both poets move seamlessly from present to past, a move echoed by the use of striking new and archival footage from both countries. Narrative, travelogue, and memoir are combined in a fusion of image, sound and word that is a total sensual experience. As the film progresses and intimacy grows, both the similarities and differences between Russian and American ways of grasping the world are revealed. Letters Not About Love becomes both a revealing portrait of two cultures and a compelling exploration of language, communication, and the art of mutual understanding.","popularity":0.21,"poster_path":"/zJ3uqpj96EKuXMVruhbZ2LrLC7P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":179110,"logo_path":null,"name":"Human Arts Association","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Letters Not About Love","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1992027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Nord","original_name":"Victor Nord","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Arkadii Dragomoshchenko (voice)","credit_id":"5a9f655a9251414bd3005a06","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lili Taylor","original_name":"Lili Taylor","popularity":1.1192,"profile_path":"/kP1tZLv3IclVldzeG9OINJXXxlU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lyn Hejinian (voice)","credit_id":"5a9f659e0e0a2641d100c349","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1104898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacki Ochs","original_name":"Jacki Ochs","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9f65c10e0a2641cb00b312","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1104898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacki Ochs","original_name":"Jacki Ochs","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9f65e5925141580c00adf4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1104898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacki Ochs","original_name":"Jacki Ochs","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9f65f2c3a3680a2000a80a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1992028,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"James Livingston","original_name":"James Livingston","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9f6604925141581e00afba","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1104898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacki Ochs","original_name":"Jacki Ochs","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9f661fc3a3680a0c00b697","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1992029,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Larry Ochs","original_name":"Larry Ochs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9f66420e0a2641e000b388","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1118003,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sergei Kuryokhin","original_name":"Сергей Курёхин","popularity":0.1587,"profile_path":"/kIvtmkFXVGW2gp1UjsXrG5D6sVH.jpg","credit_id":"5a9f665e925141581e00b008","department":"Crew","job":"Additional Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":40140,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Margaret Crimmins","original_name":"Margaret Crimmins","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9f6681925141581500b2ff","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1992031,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marie Cieri","original_name":"Marie Cieri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9f66a5925141581e00b049","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1992032,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alexey Adashevsky","original_name":"Alexey Adashevsky","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9f66b6925141581100b52b","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40141,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Hsu","original_name":"Paul Hsu","popularity":0.2383,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad36e480e0a266c2202c3f0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0151335","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zJ3uqpj96EKuXMVruhbZ2LrLC7P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Letters Not About Love - New Day Films - Arts - International Relations and Global Issues","key":"dshwn-DN4Vc","published_at":"2014-07-15T22:15:28.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Clip","official":true,"id":"5a9f6955925141581500b543"}]}}}
