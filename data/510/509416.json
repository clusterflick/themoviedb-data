But she harbours more than one dark secret, and whoever gains the throne may find that he has lost more than he has won.  Based on a story by Voltaire, this rarely performed tragic opera reveals 'The Barber of Seville' composer Giaochino Rossini in a whole new light. The title role—composed for Rossini’s wife, Isabella Colbran—features some of the most demanding vocal music he ever wrote. Angela Meade takes on the challenging vocal fireworks in this revival of a production last seen at the Met 25 years ago.","popularity":0.1664,"poster_path":"/oj4THAdbRRfVmjWAUYqFO7tWJ4t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":236,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This rarely performed tragic opera reveals 'The Barber of Seville' composer Giaochino Rossini in a whole new light.","title":"The Metropolitan Opera: Semiramide","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1576931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Meade","original_name":"Angela Meade","popularity":0.0745,"profile_path":"/pLMj6XPlTfPehXCwSvojPVxeVBV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Semiramide","credit_id":"6515e5c89b861600e24ed6b8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3009184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Javier Camarena","original_name":"Javier Camarena","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Idreno","credit_id":"6515e5e293bd6900e12c99ad","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1566958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth DeShong","original_name":"Elizabeth DeShong","popularity":0.0877,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Arsace","credit_id":"6515e5f5cadb6b02bf011e06","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1382760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ildar Abdrazakov","original_name":"Ildar Abdrazakov","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/8HP51tQMPhmwDklRduihCpXFhSM.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Assur","credit_id":"6515e6040499f200fe98df8c","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1388378,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Maurizio Benini","original_name":"Maurizio Benini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/1E7gh1B8Z3Ht9bx8yHtauIyFIsG.jpg","credit_id":"6515e613a199a600ab180b8a","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385428,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gaetano Rossi","original_name":"Gaetano Rossi","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6515e62a9b861600c5ca0c42","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932836,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gioacchino Rossini","original_name":"Gioacchino Rossini","popularity":0.0507,"profile_path":"/rEOcvlxwKQlOgFpzLPp0Qw6Ig7n.jpg","credit_id":"6515e649cadb6b02bdec6505","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1361529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Willis Sweete","original_name":"Barbara Willis Sweete","popularity":0.0994,"profile_path":"/51iCIgVSN1d0hiMG5RyqQaftWK1.jpg","credit_id":"6515e6a993bd6900fe47a578","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2923063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"MET Orchestra","original_name":"MET Orchestra","popularity":0.0984,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6515e721cadb6b02c1d0b5d0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6898654","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/omSj50QHzYLoBW5z0l1U9N850DQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oj4THAdbRRfVmjWAUYqFO7tWJ4t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1191,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/vnaAstETXYYwdbdhzQmxLZbDcC5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":842},{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1430,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lbO8EJtYA5ulpfJYHdwG6UTnU0M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"The Met: Live in HD 2017-18 Season","release_date":"2018-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
