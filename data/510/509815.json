In 1921, Shipman refused a contract with Sam Goldfish (later Goldwyn) and moved to the Idaho wilderness with a zoo of 70 wild animals to write, direct, produce and act in movies portraying women as self-reliant heroines who rescued their male leads. Shipman performed her own stunts and developed an uncanny rapport with her animal actors. The film reveals the forgotten legacy of Shipman and a generation of female silent film pioneers. The documentary includes rare footage of these artists, including minority filmmakers, Zora Neale Hurston and Miriam Wong. Geena Davis and women directors discuss gender-inequities Nell and her counterparts faced that perpetuate in today's film industry.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/bP1hJM3pO8HO1n1kDJM6R8slOB3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Girl from God's Country","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1992075,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karen Day","original_name":"Karen Day","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9f850a925141581e00c87b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4280350","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/95NJl7mV4veRrysAfHeu7UoWLoQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1095,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bP1hJM3pO8HO1n1kDJM6R8slOB3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":771}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
