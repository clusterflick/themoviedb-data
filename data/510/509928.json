This warm and carnevalistic film portrays humans in the middle of ordinary everyday survival. The main protagonists come from two totally different kinds of landscapes, from two diffent time zones. There is a scenery of contemporary modern society and just a few hundred kilometres away we find a rural and nostalgic universe with forgotten people and land.Our first protagonists are Fellini-like family, going from village to another, trying to sell meat from a small meat truck and also run a tiny funfair business. The father, the mother and their four children are working together and trusting only in themselves, not in the help of society. While countryside family is counting coins, the other pair of entrepreneurs, the two well-educated women from the capital area, have invented a vegetable protein product called Pulled Oat, and have become millionaires. But have they also made a world a little bit better?","popularity":0.6717,"poster_path":"/6ea1OxoWovOGc9gTbC6eXeoXfs7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7079,"logo_path":"/m4er9bvkoHHgELav4HPgMDlq3MP.png","name":"Oktober","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2018-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Entrepreneur","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1995968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maija Itkonen","original_name":"Maija Itkonen","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5aa53a820e0a26076002090e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1995970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reetta Kivelä","original_name":"Reetta Kivelä","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5aa53d3ec3a3687c32022e51","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1995971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jani Laine","original_name":"Jani Laine","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5aa53d5dc3a3687c060203d2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1995972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Satu Laine","original_name":"Satu Laine","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5aa53d68c3a3687bfc025ad3","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":235503,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joonas Berghäll","original_name":"Joonas Berghäll","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/lq5DsqUjwgJ80ZCklV8tvnGcJv7.jpg","credit_id":"5aa53acfc3a3687bfc025842","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1178073,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Virpi Suutari","original_name":"Virpi Suutari","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa53ade0e0a26075a02515a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178075,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Heikki Färm","original_name":"Heikki Färm","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebcf5723d3557001edd347f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1178073,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Virpi Suutari","original_name":"Virpi Suutari","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebcf5db8586780021e3f8ca","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7606162","wikidata_id":"Q104145164","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.683,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3cbatx6LIgmVverR4EYFA6cQHWL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":512},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6ea1OxoWovOGc9gTbC6eXeoXfs7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":159983,"name":"entrepreneurship"},{"id":163080,"name":"finland"},{"id":242778,"name":"pulled oats"},{"id":242779,"name":"heirloom meat"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fi","note":"Tampere Film Festival","release_date":"2018-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
