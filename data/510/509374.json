A group of neighbors wants, in a meeting, to approve the installation of security cameras and gates, to avoid actions of criminals in the place. The images have an important role in the process of convincing, so Beto asks for help from Carneiro, a cameraman who owes him favors to defend his idea. The two make images by Beira, with the intention of presenting them at the next meeting when the installation will or will not be decided. The sense of insecurity continues to grow and Beto moves internal and external forces to avoid the installation of cameras and gates in the neighborhood. Although he hates to admit it, he knows in his heart that Beira has changed.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/x1oKkUB4BlGZk2mUTV3y7Js7nDB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2018-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beira","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1991104,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Douglas Farias","original_name":"Douglas Farias","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9d70610e0a2605c6044b7e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2049,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x1oKkUB4BlGZk2mUTV3y7Js7nDB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1366}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
