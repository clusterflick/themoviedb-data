Made with intimacy and warmth, the film takes us deep into Blacker’s world as he buries his mother, closes his business and faces prison for the first time. Being Blacker offers a rarely-heard perspective on life in Britain today.","popularity":0.0769,"poster_path":"/nHVxrxIL6bEOh0YcAkJZeJJeFI9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101701,"logo_path":"/uqlHSPjt2wdmDDwqd9l4jTdG779.png","name":"Dartmouth Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":205148,"logo_path":null,"name":"RTO Pictures","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Being Blacker","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1990501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blacker Dread","original_name":"Blacker Dread","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a9c3887c3a3680c0803442a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1258170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Molly Dineen","original_name":"Molly Dineen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/cqGRQX51CVbWSDu7LhQjYNFWw3o.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Herself/Interviewer/Narrator","credit_id":"5aa4046c0e0a26075701006b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1258170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Molly Dineen","original_name":"Molly Dineen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/cqGRQX51CVbWSDu7LhQjYNFWw3o.jpg","credit_id":"5a9c38a692514127ea034082","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1258170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Molly Dineen","original_name":"Molly Dineen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/cqGRQX51CVbWSDu7LhQjYNFWw3o.jpg","credit_id":"5a9c38b30e0a260649037740","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1258170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Molly Dineen","original_name":"Molly Dineen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/cqGRQX51CVbWSDu7LhQjYNFWw3o.jpg","credit_id":"5a9c389b0e0a260658035d0f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7889514","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nHVxrxIL6bEOh0YcAkJZeJJeFI9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Being Blacker Q&A with Blacker Dread | BFI","key":"Hvr37OibLAQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":true,"published_at":"2022-08-31T15:54:18.000Z","id":"6329b4a86af9dd00821a1eb8"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Being Blacker (2018) clip - available on BFI DVD from 8 Aug 2022 | BFI","key":"lf7mx-3s3cg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":true,"published_at":"2022-08-01T17:09:16.000Z","id":"6329b4c5caab6d007dcc627c"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Being Blacker Trailer","key":"9IZkjbKJwqo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-02-02T10:51:04.000Z","id":"64e6362506f98400eb5eb43f"}]}}}
