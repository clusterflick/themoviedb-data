A hauntingly sterile emergency room. A girl crying out for her Father: God. One by one, all of the players in her life, angels and devils alike, emerge and illuminate how she ended up in this liminal consciousness between life and death. It is both in this consciousness and her previous existence that she begins to understand why God had forsaken her and how she can be redeemed. Dreamlike, visceral, and at times surreal, It's Hard to Be Human elegantly poses the age-old questions of what it means to be human and how to have a connection with the Divine in a fallibly human world.","popularity":0.2191,"poster_path":"/bhlBxwDGbdNdkt8865saoIdz4XR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2018-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"Tibetan","iso_639_1":"bo","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It's Hard To Be Human","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1991093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Gilmour","original_name":"Nina Gilmour","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Agnes","credit_id":"5a9d6c5ac3a3680c08045368","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1991094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Wilson","original_name":"Tom Wilson","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"God","credit_id":"5a9d6c70c3a3680b7d04919d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1049919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deragh Campbell","original_name":"Deragh Campbell","popularity":0.1579,"profile_path":"/4EWpsyfKr2FR0OL84dl5Vqcuq8Z.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Victoria","credit_id":"65004026efea7a00fd1b60ae","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1991089,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Peter Strauss","original_name":"Peter Strauss","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9d6bdc0e0a2630b80554ed","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1991087,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Johnny Hockin","original_name":"Johnny Hockin","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9d6bb50e0a2630b80554ca","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":55188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valerie Buhagiar","original_name":"Valerie Buhagiar","popularity":0.2042,"profile_path":"/sbYDziH3yhiFfzqIL7RSgr8QUEd.jpg","credit_id":"5a9d6b7e0e0a2605c6044707","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1562979,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rudolf  \"Rudi\" Blahacek","original_name":"Rudolf  \"Rudi\" Blahacek","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9d6b960e0a2605d5048979","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1991092,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Michelle Evans","original_name":"Michelle Evans","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9d6c20c3a3680beb0470a5","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Key Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1991091,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Judith Ann Clancy","original_name":"Judith Ann Clancy","popularity":0.0683,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9d6bf192514127ea044c75","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5065678","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2592,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bhlBxwDGbdNdkt8865saoIdz4XR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1728}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Cinequest Film Festival","release_date":"2018-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
