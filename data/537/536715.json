In 1984 he got married, to Jean. They decided to start a family. During the subsequent four years, Robb's life moved to and fro between his job as a cameraman and the regular, but failing attempts to have children. In THE TOURIST he brings these two worlds together and examines the various ways in which the personal and professional crises mirrored each other: at times comically, sometimes ironically, at other times confusedly. A reflection on fertility, uselessness, and making documentaries. -IDFA","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tourist","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90641,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robb Moss","original_name":"Robb Moss","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/wNIfIUDxHZKEwPUP0XGR3MhJyku.jpg","credit_id":"5b50df66c3a3680f04001308","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7625550","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
