Whilst revisiting his own childhood haunts, he attempts to relaunch the ancient sport of the Quintain, horseless jousting, and tries his damnedest to understand the rules of the Jingling Match. Not forgetting his attempt to restage the forgotten spectacle of Cricket on Horseback.  This might just be a journey to the very heart of sport itself, but if not, it will be a lot of fun playing games that have not been seen for hundreds of years and even more fun discovering why.","popularity":0.6571,"poster_path":"/9HnaUHPJ9IYzxUwH0C2t9jerklI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4316,"logo_path":"/7B9nsj17Yux1t2H8DrdH8W4wXhm.png","name":"Avalon Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2010-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Games That Time Forgot: Cricket on Horseback and Other Forgotten Sports","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1784796,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Alex Horne","original_name":"Alex Horne","popularity":0.2808,"profile_path":"/jLWUSMSOjwFgI6ukZw90kiQj3cT.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself -
