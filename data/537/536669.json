Zahra and her family are Muslim refugees searching for re-settlement. Her  parents, both orphans in Afghanistan, fled to Iran to continue their forbidden  love for each other where Zahra and her two sisters are born. Here, they suffer  persecution and witness severe brutality towards Afghan refugees. The  children are not permitted to attend school and the family is in constant fear  of being deported to Afghanistan.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Story of Love & Survival","title":"Journey Beyond Fear","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2087579,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robyn Hughan","original_name":"Robyn Hughan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b50a16b0e0a2641320100f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9196980","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
