This region has been called different names in different eras. Its namesakes have been buildings in nearby areas, all of which now disappeared; places like the Shinyoung Shopping Complex, which was dismantled; Baeksukdongcheon, an area now under restoration plan; Segumjeong, an already-restored building.
