Drawing upon a wealth of worldwide ballet talent, Petit's ballet and Chaplin's films, Suo reinvented the work and has given it a new lease of life. The resulting piece is not simply a filmed record of the ballet but a union of the two media that reflects the meeting of the great talents of Chaplin, Petit and Suo","popularity":0.2937,"poster_path":"/88TwCPPLkDxLpFUDIUaBxhrqFco.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5099,"logo_path":"/TN8pQL6oEqypiNvCqGop6wIGtg.png","name":"Altamira Pictures","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2011-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":131,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dancing Chaplin","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":68703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamiyo Kusakari","original_name":"草刈民代","popularity":0.3826,"profile_path":"/bhApIWYJJC9MfqzNlgDl0QaBWQH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b519e850e0a26259f010e8b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":578708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luigi Bonino","original_name":"Luigi Bonino","popularity":0.0547,"profile_path":"/lsS70rAzVK7doFqsZvpzNyR6WDb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5b519ea30e0a2625a6010977","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1007754,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Roland Petit","original_name":"Roland Petit","popularity":0.1581,"profile_path":"/bp6MstASg2TX04AbCxEYQ1p5ezo.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b519ec5c3a3680f1001150a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie Chaplin","original_name":"Charlie Chaplin","popularity":1.8855,"profile_path":"/lRI9Ky1SMOehn04OqhYJ5hQfgIK.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5b519ef492514112bd00edd9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2088024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Charles Verchere","original_name":"Jean Charles Verchere","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b519f1c0e0a2625a10116fd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2088025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lienz Chang","original_name":"Lienz Chang","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b519f3fc3a3680f10011562","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2088026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Halnaut","original_name":"Philippe Halnaut","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b519f4c0e0a262599010b22","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2088027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Harrigue","original_name":"Martin Harrigue","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b519f580e0a262599010b30","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2088028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gregoire Lansier","original_name":"Gregoire Lansier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5b519f6292514112b8010062","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":68716,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yoshikazu Suo","original_name":"周防義和","popularity":0.0772,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b51a01a92514112b8010111","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68707,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masayuki Suō","original_name":"周防正行","popularity":0.2622,"profile_path":"/4A2CECBoHNdo1hbJzsjLLIE4cWM.jpg","credit_id":"5b519e23c3a3680f0800ef0b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1007754,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Roland Petit","original_name":"Roland Petit","popularity":0.1581,"profile_path":"/bp6MstASg2TX04AbCxEYQ1p5ezo.jpg","credit_id":"5b519e66c3a3680f1300ee58","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1697894","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1441,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/88TwCPPLkDxLpFUDIUaBxhrqFco.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1017},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1498,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/e6ynJ5qq53xlX3qzaP5EWbGblM0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1011}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Montréal World Film Festival","release_date":"2010-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Pusan International Film Festival","release_date":"2010-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
