In autumn 1998, near his home in the southwest of Damascus, Khaled Abdulwahed took a landscape photograph of a cactus field on a 35mm chrome film. The old cactus fields in that area link the city with the countryside. Cacti grow all over the Middle East and are used for their fruits and as borders between houses and villages. The thorny, tough plant is also a symbol of resilience. The cactus field in Khaled’s film “backyard” consisted of 500,000 square-yards that belonged to farmers, who used to sell their cacP fruits every summer in the streets of Damascus. In the summer of 2012, the cactus fields were destroyed during the uprising, and the war started to form a new landscape. Khaled's picture on the film was damaged and lost, but he still had a scan of the photography-film.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Backyard","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2086005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Khaled Abdulwahed","original_name":"Khaled Abdulwahed","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b4de5e7c3a36823d804c3d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"FID Marseille","release_date":"2018-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
