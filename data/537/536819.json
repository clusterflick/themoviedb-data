Out of habit? Out of kindness? Out of cowardice? Intoxicated by the idea of tidying up their schedules by sorting through their old friends, Pierre and Clotilde Lecoeur (played by ERIC ELMOSNINO and LYSIANE MEIS) decide to organize farewell dinners, the ultimate form of friendly divorce. However, by choosing - as their first victim - Antoine Royer (played by GUILLAUME DE TONQUÉDEC), their oldest friend, Pierre and Clotilde are unaware that they are getting caught up in a downward spiral.","popularity":0.4102,"poster_path":"/rdc9CbYSsIVBdQVd5kHdtmvY2rC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7981,"logo_path":"/6Yv1gIAuGkHS5Vis4UjnqHhCPWV.png","name":"Pathé","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":20339,"logo_path":"/zPj4RPXztwznZcKDef583wqKERy.png","name":"Chapter 2","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":94349,"logo_path":null,"name":"Théâtre Édouard VII","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un diner d'adieu","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17896,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillaume de Tonquédec","original_name":"Guillaume de Tonquédec","popularity":0.3034,"profile_path":"/mDPeqkKJgFMiH60gH32VTwgOHSp.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"663fc0f51bed50222d908c61","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Elmosnino","original_name":"Eric Elmosnino","popularity":0.2135,"profile_path":"/tBiMY94OLEUWbBaH7GJtAZ3TY37.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"663fc11b0befec34fb435f19","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1304842,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lysiane Meis","original_name":"Lysiane Meis","popularity":0.1214,"profile_path":"/2ETJ4PQBahzLlHlwICDYxaDyw9T.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"663fc129664e117f03908b87","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1694652,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emmanuel Murat","original_name":"Emmanuel Murat","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663fc20274d9539c86165ff7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591643,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernard Murat","original_name":"Bernard Murat","popularity":0.0741,"profile_path":"/gniuqvF49lxzL2JxyAyk1YETAGN.jpg","credit_id":"663fc1d26450048a4c1ff7dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57558,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Matthieu Delaporte","original_name":"Matthieu Delaporte","popularity":0.5545,"profile_path":"/ofOMIBoC3FyRgfPRWhQxzJMCeLy.jpg","credit_id":"663fc1a445bd1c39c6f9ff6d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58255,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexandre de La Patellière","original_name":"Alexandre de La Patellière","popularity":0.2909,"profile_path":"/er7ZbU5inozZfFmvpwswjujxBos.jpg","credit_id":"663fc1bb94b8567abe0b3163","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15142404","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":980,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/rdc9CbYSsIVBdQVd5kHdtmvY2rC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6054,"name":"friendship"},{"id":4333,"name":"theatre group"},{"id":259184,"name":"public theatre"},{"id":284103,"name":"theatre"},{"id":318032,"name":"theatre performance"},{"id":323287,"name":"théâtre"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"6play","release_date":"2022-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
