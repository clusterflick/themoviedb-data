He was one of the greatest, most original talents of this time and has been judged a precursor of firstly the modernist style and subsequently of the Art Deco movement. His legacy lives on all around us in his instantly recognisable style.  A MODERN MAN takes a critical look at Mackintoshâ€™s life and artistic career and the importance of the friends and patrons who provided him with regular work when it mattered most.","popularity":0.3042,"poster_path":"/52LRM7kpY5xW5k7VF8I15uLvzAe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3712,"logo_path":"/7PdJYn2l0iBViud7oqxRHO9UEIR.png","name":"BBC Scotland","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Charles Rennie Mackintosh: A Modern Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":934457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terence Conran","original_name":"Terence Conran","popularity":0.0847,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b513b1e92514112c3007b28","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2087878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Jones","original_name":"Anthony Jones","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b513bc792514112c9008391","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1530566,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Downes","original_name":"Richard Downes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/sRtrBRunA3S7J4ZLHiZu5oYEEv.jpg","credit_id":"5b513bf892514112b8008772","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/52LRM7kpY5xW5k7VF8I15uLvzAe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":388,"name":"scotland"},{"id":892,"name":"glasgow, scotland"},{"id":2301,"name":"architect"},{"id":2679,"name":"artist"},{"id":12436,"name":"architecture"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
