However, despite his name being Crazy Samad, he is more honest and intelligent than some people. Since the film is based on a combination of three stories, it tells the story of the misfortunes of three different families: Samad, who is tortured by his brother, Karbalai Eyvaz, who beats his wife because of her stubbornness, and Zuleykha, who is beaten by her husband because of her harsh language. We look at all these events through the eyes of Crazy Samad.","popularity":0.1069,"poster_path":"/qonSmhA44UT9KwQJjh0hJQOfjRJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105543,"logo_path":"/6Fq1RN4322VfSLrVRZqbt80jp9i.png","name":"AzTV (Azərbaycan
