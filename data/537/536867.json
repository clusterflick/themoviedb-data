Here the protagonists are an accident-prone worker and a ballerina-manager who has the tools to alleviate the worker’s problems.  At the center of the piece is the color equation, Red + White = Pink, from which multiple parallel meanings emerge. The first is the old term “pinko,” meaning a watered down Communism, or a liberal with uncommitted Red sympathies. The second is a proposal to solve future crises in meat supply by re-valuating hot dog and sausage production as a solution, by integrating ‘undesirable’ portions of pig with the ‘desirable’ portions, embodying perfect equivalence in consumable form. And the third is pink as femininity – not as a ‘natural’ fleshy softness, but rather a synthetic, engineered (and potentially violent) hybridity.","popularity":0.0853,"poster_path":"/s0vTKLg82CHGBr0EOr5cd2ut7qC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pink Detachment","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2216774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katharine Liu","original_name":"Katharine Liu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Accident-Prone Worker","credit_id":"5c3bc65dc3a36853ce3c1a7c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2216775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mayu Oguri","original_name":"Mayu Oguri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Manager Ballerina","credit_id":"5c3bc67ac3a36821623bff6a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2216779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corey Tazmania","original_name":"Corey Tazmania","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5c3bc6b2c3a36859f53c221c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1831604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabelle Zufferey Boulton","original_name":"Isabelle Zufferey Boulton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5c3bc6bfc3a368638a3c2cfc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2216770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eli Condon","original_name":"Eli Condon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Company Dancer","credit_id":"5c3bc6180e0a2654c18c8e2d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2216771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jasmine Hong","original_name":"Jasmine Hong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Company Dancer","credit_id":"5c3bc626c3a36821623bfed2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2216772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathalie Encarnacion","original_name":"Nathalie Encarnacion","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Company Dancer","credit_id":"5c3bc634c3a368638a3c2c6b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2216777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maura Harris","original_name":"Maura Harris","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Company Dancer","credit_id":"5c3bc69a9251411a58ab3b26","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2216778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sorcha Fatooh","original_name":"Sorcha Fatooh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Company Dancer","credit_id":"5c3bc6a50e0a2676538c8ddc","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2088183,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jen Liu","original_name":"Jen Liu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b51ffbb0e0a26259d014e22","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1799453,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Maria Rusche","original_name":"Maria Rusche","popularity":0.0645,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe0473e3c887d0042ae0d1d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s0vTKLg82CHGBr0EOr5cd2ut7qC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"vimeo","release_date":"2015-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
