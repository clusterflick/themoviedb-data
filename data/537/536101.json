It takes us into the minds and hearts of a group of idealists and careerists as they take their separate paths in life. These people will tell you that they are the best of friends.  They believe they are from the same country, yet in the privacy of a room, they are apart, alone and in a state of exile.","popularity":0.5441,"poster_path":"/6q1nIqN5fJblf72OWFhp6d0KA6R.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Ourselves","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aidan Gillen","original_name":"Aidan Gillen","popularity":2.2435,"profile_path":"/fWWRgyJEGjOPcx43CaFiUCWMBLo.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5b4cbb64c3a36823de044623","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1007679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seána Kerslake","original_name":"Seána Kerslake","popularity":0.1722,"profile_path":"/CGlj8ei2SGqOGId2vbvQRXcYDM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5b4cbb6dc3a36823e6044630","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1373165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Reid","original_name":"Paul Reid","popularity":0.3355,"profile_path":"/j94PrRDF1bZQ4fDE4y8NaxIPVt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5b4cbb7d0e0a26453203a939","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":232941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Walker","original_name":"Catherine Walker","popularity":0.3216,"profile_path":"/sWPaelbeMW1Z7ZGnXCsaRpJevW6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5b4cbb8a9251417d1e03a3fc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2085605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caitríona Ennis","original_name":"Caitríona Ennis","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5b4cbb9d0e0a26453b03fbb9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gavin Drea","original_name":"Gavin Drea","popularity":0.3246,"profile_path":"/6UjJETk9PHdZuBCkMkhE7d7SAXV.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5b4cbbaf0e0a26454403e6ff","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1135879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Declan Conlon","original_name":"Declan Conlon","popularity":0.4561,"profile_path":"/tozd3BAPHMVZ7Vzk330kNU2gjpx.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5b4cbbc09251417d0f03864a","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74953,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Mercier","original_name":"Paul Mercier","popularity":0.1571,"profile_path":"/1GcIA6oQ3aaBG8HSfBcCRf6R5DW.jpg","credit_id":"5b4cbbe50e0a26454403e73d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74953,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Mercier","original_name":"Paul Mercier","popularity":0.1571,"profile_path":"/1GcIA6oQ3aaBG8HSfBcCRf6R5DW.jpg","credit_id":"5b4cbbf2c3a36823ed044c66","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2085608,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anne Gately","original_name":"Anne Gately","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b4cbc09c3a36823db0307a3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8649118","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1763,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6q1nIqN5fJblf72OWFhp6d0KA6R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1175}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
