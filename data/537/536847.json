He works a dead-end office job where his colleagues make fun of him but comes alive when he's out dancing, drinking and womanising.  Edward's world is turned upside down when he meets Agatha - the woman of his dreams - who helps him to become the gentleman he's always strived to be, but is she real or just a paper doll?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paper Doll","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2088140,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Keller","original_name":"Matthew Keller","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b51e51992514112ae012c9c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2088140,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Keller","original_name":"Matthew Keller","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b51e525c3a3680f13013088","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2088141,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Anya Krasnikova","original_name":"Anya Krasnikova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b51e588c3a3680f0c0156e4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"paperdollfilm","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
