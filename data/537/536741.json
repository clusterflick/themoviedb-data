A female voice reads a mythological text on the origin of the world and sets the tone for a documentary-meditation on the presence of primeval elements – like water and flora – and their cohabitation with the natives, whose portraits intersperse the film. The stealthy camera follows a boat drifting across the calm waters of a river, as if the latter were the rings of a tree disclosing its history, in a movement that lulls us and drives us to the physical and metaphysical core. Finally, accompanied by an ancestral chant, the etching gives way to a sequence of images (which in turn emerge like a river reducing the field of action to the essential) and moves into a poetic terrain, summoning the imagination of each one.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/rnuCSCeTX1Sg4hgwoTwk0qQNw0d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2018-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strong Waters","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2094175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adriana Villa","original_name":"Adriana Villa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5b5c787c0e0a262e9c015f62","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1891411,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mónica Baptista","original_name":"Mónica Baptista","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b51d09992514112c3011983","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2094173,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pedro Augusto","original_name":"Pedro Augusto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b5c77dfc3a368421b016b96","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2094174,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Dayana Lucas","original_name":"Dayana Lucas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b5c77f60e0a262ea1015c8f","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1891411,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mónica Baptista","original_name":"Mónica Baptista","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b5c7746c3a368422f017373","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1891411,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mónica Baptista","original_name":"Mónica Baptista","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b5c7755c3a3684221018538","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2094171,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Don Pedro Sinuiri","original_name":"Don Pedro Sinuiri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b5c77770e0a262e95016019","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8947190","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":980,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rnuCSCeTX1Sg4hgwoTwk0qQNw0d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"26th Curtas Vila do Conde - International Film Festival","release_date":"2018-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
