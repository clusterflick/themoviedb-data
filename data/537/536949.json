De Agostini made in the Patagonian mountain range and in the Tierra del Fuego archipelago. Executed with rare mastery and exquisite artistic sense, the film shows the explorer in the labyrinth of Patagonian channels, penetrating the deep fjords between large masses of floating ice of curious shapes, coming from the immense glaciers that descend from the Cordillera and bathe its frontal walls on the waters of the sea. Transported to regions of extraordinary beauty, situated in front of gigantic mountains, from which majestic waterfalls rush, the viewer experiences the illusion of finding themselves in a mysterious kingdom of dream and enchantment.","popularity":0.2537,"poster_path":"/5u0anBNrC6PJNCconXPLzNFGqIk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"1933-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Terre magellaniche","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","title":"Patagonia 1915-1928","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Patagonia 1915-1928","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2088547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto María de Agostini","original_name":"Alberto María de Agostini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b52cebec3a3680b5b008840","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1269596","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.745,"height":886,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5u0anBNrC6PJNCconXPLzNFGqIk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":660}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18266,"name":"south america"},{"id":18330,"name":"nature"},{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1933-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
