Maybe once, some time ago, he was loved. Maybe, some time, he had loved ones waiting for him, missing him. Today he is only a shadow, lost amongst all the shadows of the days that begin and no one sees. He is a shadow that wakes up in the sidewalk and rummages the trashcans, searching for plastic bottles or cans to sell for a few coins that will give him to eat for the day. It’s the fight to survive one more day, every day, one more day.","popularity":0.0762,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"2013-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"From the eyes of a homeless man","title":"Galus Galus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1292345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leónidas Urbina","original_name":"Leónidas Urbina","popularity":0.049,"profile_path":"/fi13CY6aS25K59Iyy7TQxBJzD9e.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"538017920e0a2624c0006ad3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clarissa Duque","original_name":"Clarissa Duque","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"538017390e0a2624bd006947","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323524,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Clarissa Duque","original_name":"Clarissa Duque","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"538017510e0a2624c700686f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2899450","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
