Khader is a young man whose family's crushing debts force him to choose between his dream of becoming an actor or abandoning everything to become an illegal alien in Europe. Rabia is an opinionated, ambitious young woman, with strong religious beliefs, struggling to open a clothing store while waiting for the return of her boyfriend. Youssef, a small-time drug dealer coming out of prison, follows any clue he comes upon in search of his brother, who had disappeared without a trace. How will these three young people build their futures? Ordinary Boys is a fly-on-the-wall film that provides a vision from within of what life is truly like in a poor Muslim community.","popularity":0.0436,"poster_path":"/fd97mCN5b2VEn7mChqhk2Z57Ab.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10070,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alea Docs & Films","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2008-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ordinary Boys","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","title":"Normální kluci","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Τα παιδιά της διπλανής πόρτας","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Chicos normales","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1324403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"El-Khader Aoulasse","original_name":"El-Khader Aoulasse","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5382facbc3a368059e0083b7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1324404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Youseff Belefki","original_name":"Youseff Belefki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5382fad3c3a368059e0083bc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1324405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rabia Bouchfira","original_name":"Rabia Bouchfira","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5382fadac3a36805a1008023","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1324406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohammed Saadoun","original_name":"Mohammed Saadoun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5382fae1c3a368059800839e","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1191027,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Hernández","original_name":"Daniel Hernández","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":"/2ACcjcG6y3MGFLFPVtAPYQxEhir.jpg","credit_id":"5382fafbc3a368059e0083c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4041753,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jorge Mota Ortiz","original_name":"Jorge Mota Ortiz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6451bc8f713ea6017ba24f5e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1596847,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gabi Martinez","original_name":"Gabi Martinez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6451bc38d8f44e0154ee5988","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4041754,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gael Wermelinger","original_name":"Gael Wermelinger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6451bc9b713ea6017ba24f6d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1191027,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Hernández","original_name":"Daniel Hernández","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":"/2ACcjcG6y3MGFLFPVtAPYQxEhir.jpg","credit_id":"6451bc1d87a27a00e38e8dc5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2413985,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alberto García Demestres","original_name":"Alberto García Demestres","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6451bc5d87a27a011b12b156","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1674398,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pablo Usón","original_name":"Pablo Usón","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6451bc51d8f44e0154ee59a6","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2718867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pedro Ballesteros","original_name":"Pedro Ballesteros","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6451bc80c044290122caf270","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1281370","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fd97mCN5b2VEn7mChqhk2Z57Ab.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"San Sebastián Film Festival - Spain","release_date":"2008-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
