Duchy z morza","overview":"In the crystal clear waters off the coast of Borneo, a unique way of life threatens to disappear forever. For generations, the Badjao were oceanic nomads, living in harmony with the sea as fishermen and free divers. Nowadays, however, only a few Badjao remain, like Alexan, who still remembers the old ways. He hopes to pass his knowledge along to his ten-year-old nephew Sari, but time and opportunities are running out. Sari loves the sea, but it can only offer a hard life of subsistence fishing, while the nearby tourist resort sings a siren song of easy money.","popularity":0.0703,"poster_path":"/9tLOiA6RZqlTurNyU6rYqglb6GO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116008,"logo_path":null,"name":"Braidmade Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walking Under Water","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1322902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sari","original_name":"Sari","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"537e7a9dc3a368059b001ca3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1322900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eliza Kubarska","original_name":"Eliza Kubarska","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"537e7a63c3a368059e001cf3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1322900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eliza Kubarska","original_name":"Eliza Kubarska","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"537e7a6dc3a3680598001c6e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":566111,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jacaszek","original_name":"Jacaszek","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/6R14UCTZod7bweP2pF8VjtKDNDd.jpg","credit_id":"638655a0fb8346007c48c29c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1610570,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bartosz Pietras","original_name":"Bartosz Pietras","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662638ee197de401642b0239","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1173993,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Monika Braid","original_name":"Monika Braid","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662638fd221ba6016313eda4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589430,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Piotr Rosołowski","original_name":"Piotr Rosołowski","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/92CPp9zFRTbTl2IlSp3IBSy5W0T.jpg","credit_id":"662638e162f335017ddad767","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3772325,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maciej Ostoja-Chyżyński","original_name":"Maciej Ostoja-Chyżyński","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676e845a355bec07b092b56f","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3715964","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9tLOiA6RZqlTurNyU6rYqglb6GO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hot Docs","release_date":"2014-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Badjao.
