He had been a critic of the racist Bantu education system and the brutal disciplinary methods of his school’s Afrikaner principal. The film juxtaposes Professor Bolofo’s flight to asylum with vibrant scenes from the daily life of his village. This is not a documentary of explanation— of politics, of sociology— but an outpouring of images of the people given life by an artist and photographer.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Land Is White, the Seed Is Black","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323299,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Koto Bolofo","original_name":"Koto Bolofo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"537f4e9a0e0a2624c7004e61","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0180791","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
