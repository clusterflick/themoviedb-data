Using the words of their ancestors passed on by oral folklore, the villagers trace the history of their village and their difficulties in working their land and living off their produce. Fad'jal is an extraordinary boundary defying film that interweaves ethnographic footage, intimate observation of everyday village life and fictionalised historical scenes. With it, Faye carefully encourages the viewers to reflect both on African history and storytelling, and on the intersection of fiction and documentary.","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":"/56DErD8o0rTxKfabWPHfvhbn8A8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SN","name":"Senegal"}],"release_date":"1979-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Come and Work","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Fad Jal","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Grand-père raconte","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"Come and Work","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1298788,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Safi Faye","original_name":"Safi Faye","popularity":0.1038,"profile_path":"/xwxoVwvhmIwlGNVgHXEoIoo5yK9.jpg","credit_id":"538086f40e0a2624bd007967","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":129920,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marie-Christine Rougerie","original_name":"Marie-Christine Rougerie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d29230b5f6c496ff25ed3b6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2360525,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dominique Smadja","original_name":"Dominique Smadja","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d2923155f6c4916bc628b2e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1595663,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Patrick Fabry","original_name":"Patrick Fabry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d2922d95f6c4916bc628a66","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2360526,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Babacar Diagne","original_name":"Babacar Diagne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d29232da294f000112a8d17","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1158026,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andrée Davanture","original_name":"Andrée Davanture","popularity":0.0791,"profile_path":"/uhLcjEf2mNzlORwvfyqGnZS4g7Z.jpg","credit_id":"5d2922faa294f0000f2a8174","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1298788,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Safi Faye","original_name":"Safi Faye","popularity":0.1038,"profile_path":"/xwxoVwvhmIwlGNVgHXEoIoo5yK9.jpg","credit_id":"5d2922d0be4b3612f5a2fa73","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2360523,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Papa Mictar Ndoye","original_name":"Papa Mictar Ndoye","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d2922f05f6c491be35edb0a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1659259,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Monod","original_name":"Jean Monod","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d2922e2caab6d7ddb972d42","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0126292","wikidata_id":"Q122874755","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8Wc6fA2YuvVIx1quhxrekS5yx6v.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.729,"height":776,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/tbn9Y6zF8DC0TPrZZS2Ej41Tdey.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1371,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/56DErD8o0rTxKfabWPHfvhbn8A8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":914}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Melbourne International Film Festival","release_date":"2023-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
