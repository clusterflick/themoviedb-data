A \"Bray\" Studios Production. Bobby tries to sneak his dog into the theatre. He gets past the woman at the kiosk but the commissionaire spots the dog in a mirror. The pooch licks tears from his master's eyes as they sit on the pavement outside. An aristocratic lady arrives at the theatre in a chauffeur driven car and the dog gets underneath the train of her dress and into the auditorium. Bobby follows after him. They watch a film where a hypnotist commands his victim to \"Bark like a dog\". Bobby tries to hypnotise his pet and tells him to \"Bark like a dog\". He does so and they are thrown out of the theatre. They are kicked so hard that they fly through the window of a tram. Bobby then hypnotises the conductor into believing that they had paid their fare and indeed that the conductor owes them change. The conductor gives them some money. Bobby has a good laugh about their scams.","popularity":0.048,"poster_path":"/eLW3SJoXvOK9xYLyO4pviHGBDGC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1919-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bobby Bumps and the Hypnotic Eye","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Earl Hurd","original_name":"Earl Hurd","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"537ed3c60e0a2624cb003a11","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0009944","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1732,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eLW3SJoXvOK9xYLyO4pviHGBDGC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1156}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1919-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Pen And Inklings - Bobby And His Hypnotic Eye (1920)","key":"S5-XvgejKE0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-04-13T13:32:11.000Z","id":"67474dda026682b92eb07d63"}]}}}
