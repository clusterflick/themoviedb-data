Having gained their trust, he was able to get close to them. Living among the gang members, he witnessed horrific events, and while hiding his real identity, he photographed a one-of-a-kind collection of gripping stills.  Over thirty years have passed. Esaias Baitel has laid his camera down. He returns to the dark nights he spent in the City of Lights, the city where he lived a double life, going back and forth from the gang to the young family he had just started.","popularity":0.1222,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1864,"logo_path":null,"name":"Claudius Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2013-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A documentary film about the Photographer and second holocaust generation - Esaias Baitel and his journey to the darkness of the Neo-Nazis gang in Paris","title":"Four Years of Night","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1030507,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Esaias Baitel","original_name":"Esaias Baitel","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5381eaf80e0a2624c000a52a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1324105,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Itamar Alcalay","original_name":"Itamar Alcalay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5381eb0f0e0a2624b400a425","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1324106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Claudia Levin","original_name":"Claudia Levin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5381eb300e0a26588c005aa0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1324105,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Itamar Alcalay","original_name":"Itamar Alcalay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5381eb420e0a2624bd00a26b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1324109,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Aliza Azkira","original_name":"Aliza Azkira","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5381eb680e0a2624c000a537","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1324110,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ronit Rolland","original_name":"Ronit Rolland","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5381eb7b0e0a2657cd002dbd","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1033063,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Yoav Raz","original_name":"Yoav Raz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5381eba70e0a2657cd002dcc","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1324107,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Itai Neeman","original_name":"Itai Neeman","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64551817d8f44e0dadf55a21","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1739,"name":"holocaust (shoah)"},{"id":161316,"name":"social documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-08-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Four years of night trailer english (A film by Itamar Alcalay)","key":"ms1ppzaib4g","published_at":"2013-06-28T07:34:13.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5381ec840e0a2624c000a55f"}]}}}
