After he filled in for Brian Wilson as a touring member of the Beach Boys that year, the Beach Boys' label, Capitol Records, offered Campbell a solo recording contract, which paid off two years later when Campbell's pop-folky country version of John Hartford's poetic and tumbling \"Gentle on My Mind\" hit the pop charts. Campbell's solo career was on the way, and the rest, as they say, is history. This collection features live performances from Campbell captured between 1972 and 2001, and includes versions of all of his classic hits, as well as bonus tracks of Campbell duets with Wayne Newton, Anne Murray, Seals & Croft, Helen Reddy, and others.","popularity":0.6732,"poster_path":"/dEGXkOvB8rW0fjCkEfcJ5uvem40.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Glen Campbell | Live Anthology (1972-2001)","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glen Campbell","original_name":"Glen Campbell","popularity":0.5469,"profile_path":"/kBd4JGVWRjSVEjHsnqe77OVDEEA.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"654ac379391b9c00ad734c2c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wayne Newton","original_name":"Wayne Newton","popularity":0.3686,"profile_path":"/nyRTuri5DvC1WYhMpMjORUci9Gl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"654ac49dfd4f8000ae2c56b0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15178,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jimmy Webb","original_name":"Jimmy Webb","popularity":0.1129,"profile_path":"/18Jum4p1eAmZKyn7Z4qzcBSqdS6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"654aca051ac2927b2c81fb41","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1236806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Murray","original_name":"Anne Murray","popularity":0.16,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"654adca4532acb01380cc89e","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kol8keo4bawChdip2NTfvjqipm8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4uXgnFXlHFOhUrhHHtunLgg0mSd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dEGXkOvB8rW0fjCkEfcJ5uvem40.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uTJKc7ABGtE6Eyw5Z0tvldf0BeS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
