One day, acting on a suggestion by his father, he lands a job at the Weather Bureau. The work is challenging to him, and a little daunting, and his adjustment is considerably eased for him by his female co-worker \"George,\" as she is called. The two become close, eventually marrying and moving in together. While they are adapting to the married state, conditions at work are deteriorating in a bizarre and irrational way, which puts a considerable strain on both the newlyweds.","popularity":0.6631,"poster_path":"/pug7blFR3Twgf7KnnqOiKN1RYit.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A sunny love story in an overcast world","title":"Stan and George's New Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":127348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Chubb","original_name":"Paul Chubb","popularity":0.1149,"profile_path":"/nCg5n8aytXwnGhAScKIfYW8EyoM.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Stanley Harris","credit_id":"537e2a7f0e0a2624c0002612","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":218254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julie Forsyth","original_name":"Julie Forsyth","popularity":0.1438,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"George","credit_id":"537e2a880e0a2624cb0023b4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Bluthal","original_name":"John Bluthal","popularity":0.3077,"profile_path":"/vdM8UyPL8Plaroa7rlOVX4SWbJ6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Stan Senior","credit_id":"537e2a900e0a2624bd0024f8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1322657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Ford","original_name":"Margaret Ford","popularity":0.0843,"profile_path":"/omaYLXCKEJ85nf6u6uNOmfkbtHW.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sheila Harris","credit_id":"537e2a990e0a2624c000261b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1322658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Baldwin","original_name":"Roy Baldwin","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Thomas Sterns","credit_id":"537e2aa20e0a2624cb0023bc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1212152,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Alexander","original_name":"Bruce Alexander","popularity":0.0991,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Geoffrey","credit_id":"537e2aad0e0a2624c7002547","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1322660,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian McKenzie","original_name":"Brian McKenzie","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"537e2ad4c3a36805a1001663","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":582391,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Deb Cox","original_name":"Deb Cox","popularity":0.2573,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"537e2acec3a368059500166d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1322660,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian McKenzie","original_name":"Brian McKenzie","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b1f7722c3a368405e000990","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0102974","wikidata_id":"Q7597991","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pug7blFR3Twgf7KnnqOiKN1RYit.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Stan and Georges new life excerpt","key":"i-MRYdBJ-0g","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":true,"published_at":"2014-09-26T01:58:29.000Z","id":"63bc675afc31d3008bcf099a"}]}}}
