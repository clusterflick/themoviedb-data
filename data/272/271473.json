Set in various locations - including a gymnasium, an abandoned hospital, and a trailer park circus - Martin and Olsen slip between a ventriloquist and his dummy, a seducer and his surrogate, a doctor and his patient, and synchronized dance partners. The film examines a complex social psychology - questioning the colonization of the human body for various political, medical and religious agendas.","popularity":0.2179,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"29 incidents of dual consequence","title":"A Heretic's Primer on Love and Exertion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kym Olsen","original_name":"Kym Olsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"537f9518c3a36805a40038be","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1323450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trevor Martin","original_name":"Trevor Martin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"537f95860e0a2624cb005606","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1090679,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniele Wilmouth","original_name":"Daniele Wilmouth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"537f8336c3a3681a0200022c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323451,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Messing","original_name":"Mark Messing","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"537f8d4bc3a36805a4003830","department":"Writing","job":"Musical"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323452,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Split Lip Rayfield","original_name":"Split Lip Rayfield","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"537f8d6ac3a36805950038a8","department":"Writing","job":"Musical"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1090679,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniele Wilmouth","original_name":"Daniele Wilmouth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"537f8ecd0e0a2624c7005831","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1456468","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10583,"name":"performance art"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
