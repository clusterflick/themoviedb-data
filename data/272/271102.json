To paraphrase Satō Tadao’s blurb on the back cover of the video, this is an important film for three reasons. 1. it is an almost perfectly well preserved copy of one of only a few full-length movies still available of the first superstar in Japanese cinema history, the very famous Onoe Matsunosuke. 2. it uses a method that was common in the silent era, the dyeing/tinting of film to mark given moments of day (for ex., blue for night-time) or given situations (for ex., red for fire) – and even though most films that used this technique have been redeveloped in straight b&w, this one is available in its original form. 3. it is an early SFX (special effects) movie that uses the basic tools of the trade - a great action movie full of swordsmanship and monsters (bakemono).","popularity":0.1304,"poster_path":"/h5zTIaJfTwH1yKtygYRNcK7vgZ8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122567,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nikkatsu Kyoto","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1922-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shibukawa Bangorō","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1088028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matsunosuke Onoe","original_name":"尾上松之助","popularity":0.1095,"profile_path":"/dG59bo5oxZ4KIgZ5FsnK9piKgtl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"537d48540e0a2624c0000568","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1322349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kohaku Arashi","original_name":"Kohaku Arashi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"537d485a0e0a2624c3000579","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1322350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shôen Kataoka","original_name":"片岡松燕","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"537d48600e0a2624bd000561","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1282061,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomiyasu Ikeda","original_name":"池田富保","popularity":0.1288,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"537d48680e0a2624cb0004d2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1322351,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sennosuke Nakamura","original_name":"中村仙之助","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"537d486f0e0a2624b4000551","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1322352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Utagoro Onoe","original_name":"尾上卯多五郎","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"537d48750e0a2624c0000577","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1322353,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kijaku Ôtani","original_name":"大谷鬼若","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"537d487b0e0a2624b4000558","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1282063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"En'ichirō Jitsukawa","original_name":"實川延一郎","popularity":0.0739,"profile_path":"/dA5SWrDvuyVRkIAxWunRpprsNG4.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"537d48860e0a2624b4000561","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1322354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamanokyoku Onoe","original_name":"Tamanokyoku Onoe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"537d488b0e0a2624c0000582","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1322355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hazaemon Bando","original_name":"Hazaemon Bando","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"537d48910e0a2624ba000501","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1322356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kakumatsuro Arashi","original_name":"嵐珏松郎","popularity":0.0847,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"537d48980e0a2624ba000506","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1322357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kamesaburo Arashi","original_name":"Kamesaburo Arashi","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"537d48a00e0a2624c000058b","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1322348,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kōkichi Tsukiyama","original_name":"Kōkichi Tsukiyama","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"537d48250e0a2624c3000562","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1828953,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Seitarô Matsumura","original_name":"Seitarô Matsumura","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d48e5466ee96854dc0f3f8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0160863","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h5zTIaJfTwH1yKtygYRNcK7vgZ8.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1922-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
