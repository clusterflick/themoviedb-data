The trouble begins when his ambitious younger son, Kalifa lapses and gets involved with his older brother's hoodlum friends. Kalifa then gives them his money and soon loses his job. The city has a curfew at night and only those with a highly-prized identity card are allowed out. Police rigorously patrol the streets in search of whores and people without cards. One homeless, unemployed man, Oussou, decides to earn the card by becoming a stoolie for the cops, and snitches on Kalifa's older brother, precipitating a police raid of Faco's home that results in their finding a cache of illegal drugs. Faco and the older son are both stripped naked and thrown in jail. Suddenly Faco finds himself brutalized and humiliated by his Muslim brothers. Meanwhile, the dark-skinned daughter of a white storekeeper, with a lust for black hookers, sets off to find her real mother.","popularity":0.078,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BF","name":"Burkina Faso"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1995-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bambara","iso_639_1":"bm","name":"Bamanankan"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Haramuya","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abdoulaye Kaba","original_name":"Abdoulaye Kaba","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"53819bc0c3a36805a1006624","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rakieta Kabore","original_name":"Rakieta Kabore","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"53819bc8c3a36805a80063f1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1289941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aï Keïta","original_name":"Aï Keïta","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"53819bd0c3a36805a80063f5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1083486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abdoulaye Komboudri","original_name":"Abdoulaye Komboudri","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"60daae3a17c443005e8397cc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3140258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fatogoma Konate","original_name":"Fatogoma Konate","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"60daae40590086005dc0273b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323973,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Drissa Toure","original_name":"Drissa Toure","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60daae090e5aba00296facca","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2391869,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"François Kuhnel","original_name":"François Kuhnel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60daae1205f9cf002b7020f4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1595114,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kahéna Attia","original_name":"Kahéna Attia","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/4fUbzJysBoNLFFTRVASwVAtY1Wy.jpg","credit_id":"60daae1adbf144005e2cc8d4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323973,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Drissa Toure","original_name":"Drissa Toure","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53819bddc3a368059b00674b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20680,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jean Bréhat","original_name":"Jean Bréhat","popularity":0.0877,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d7f2f112b10e00851ce435","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323973,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Drissa Toure","original_name":"Drissa Toure","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d7f2fa20e6a5007b01ecd9","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0113258","wikidata_id":"Q65322142","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
