The 65 fire stations situated in the Bronx receive fire calls about 160,000 times a year, that is to say 200 times a day. Some are false alarms, but many are very dangerous situations.The fires are caused by different reasons, but most of the fires are cases of arson. A special fire brigade including sheriffs has been created to combat this. We follow police inspector Haynes who investigates the motives for the fires which caused the death of 9 firemen who died this year in arson blazes. This film spends 14 harrowing days with the firemen of the Bronx as they fight fires and perform a last-minute rescue of a baby who fainted in the smoke.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Firemen of the Bronx","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
