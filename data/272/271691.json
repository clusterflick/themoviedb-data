In the story, a young forest ranger who sees that his work holds the key to the future of his country (through reforestation) is disgusted at the short-sighted, money-grubbing ways of his superiors. He has a much better relationship with local villagers than with his agency's bosses. As the movie opens, the villagers are preparing to hold a hunting ceremony but are not sure whether they will do it the old fashioned way, with a bonfire, or will obey a government decree that open fires are too dangerous. There is a lot of sexual teasing between the villagers, including some harmless horseplay. For instance, when a man whispers another woman's name in his sleep, his wife pours water into his ear in revenge.","popularity":0.3093,"poster_path":"/9RH9gd3PHKaxu2HrbnIP8BFJ1RE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84261,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kora Films","origin_country":""},{"id":93505,"logo_path":null,"name":"C.N.P.C.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ML","name":"Mali"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1991-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Bambara","iso_639_1":"bm","name":"Bamanankan"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fire!","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Djeneba Diawara","original_name":"Djeneba Diawara","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Koro","credit_id":"53803e91c3a3681a020012b0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mamadou Fomba","original_name":"Mamadou Fomba","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"53803e98c3a36805a1004868","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":545037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Balla Moussa Keita","original_name":"Balla Moussa Keita","popularity":0.061,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Fakoro","credit_id":"53803ea0c3a3680598004977","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1320800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diarrah Sanogo","original_name":"Diarrah Sanogo","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Gnedjougou","credit_id":"598b980e92514107ee000151","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1721169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fily Traoré","original_name":"Fily Traoré","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Sidy","credit_id":"598b9818c3a368736c000192","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1303653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adama Drabo","original_name":"Adama Drabo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53803eb8c3a368059800497a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1303653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adama Drabo","original_name":"Adama Drabo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"598b97e6c3a36873bd000113","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4028124,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rose Evans","original_name":"Rose Evans","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6447f6e7c51acd050ea94604","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1720482,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lionel Cousin","original_name":"Lionel Cousin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6447f6e1140bad04fda772fc","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0195325","wikidata_id":"Q5451250","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":1239,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9RH9gd3PHKaxu2HrbnIP8BFJ1RE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":833}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":409,"name":"africa"},{"id":208669,"name":"mali"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-02-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
