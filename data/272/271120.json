It reveals Singapore's past and present with a delight and humour that makes it a necessary film for all Singaporeans. We hear buskers, street vendors, school cheerleaders sing hymns to themselves and to their communities. From these vocabularies (including Arabic, Latin, Hainanese), a sense of what it might mean to be a modern Singaporean emerges. This is Singapore's first documentary to have a cinema release. With English and Chinese subtitles.","popularity":0.214,"poster_path":"/6YCA4pGqyjNeTVaLjAQODp6ZmFd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2005-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Singapore GaGa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1322397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melvyn Cedello","original_name":"Melvyn Cedello","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"537db9560e0a2624bd00185b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1322399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Khoo","original_name":"Victor Khoo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"537db9680e0a2624c70018c7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1322400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hong Chow Yew","original_name":"Hong Chow Yew","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"537db9750e0a2624c3001849","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1322401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Leng Tan","original_name":"Margaret Leng Tan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"537db9860e0a2624b400190e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1322402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juanita Melson","original_name":"Juanita Melson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"537db9970e0a2624c000199f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1322394,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tan Pin Pin","original_name":"Tan Pin Pin","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":"/a4Fo2ccwMyo53Hf8e8aJodK5Dj2.jpg","credit_id":"537db8670e0a2624b70018b4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0976172","wikidata_id":"Q107060058","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zTNfa6DEBahAnADLsAGv7tXZ1PU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":2.493,"height":511,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zx6vtLZUwE9lslIuB88YRXmqHGf.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1274}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6YCA4pGqyjNeTVaLjAQODp6ZmFd.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1066},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/e5gYrNBIiSzb7GTXP3LPwzqgpwS.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5WVRwQEHuNDfjcXNQHt0AAmZMWd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.659,"height":992,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rK3W1S4X738j5LgSHZanAwnCiKo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":654}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4224,"name":"singapore"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Singapore GaGa - Official Trailer","key":"117253974","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-01-20T09:29:43.000Z","id":"6165b37284591c008fc0fd17"}]}}}
