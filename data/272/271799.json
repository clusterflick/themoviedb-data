For now, he's still looking at the fundraising and casting stage of the process. He calls upon Jean Almereyda, a once-fashionable producer who is now going through a bad patch, finding it increasingly difficult to raise the capital he needs for his ventures. His wife Eurydice dreams of being a movie star. A perverse game between the two men ensues, with Almereyda wanting to please his wife, but reluctant to demand a role for Eurydice because of Bazin's reputation as an incorrigible seducer.","popularity":0.3956,"poster_path":"/27sJGjDalRxhgFWCc9F1LwTDr25.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13799,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hamster
