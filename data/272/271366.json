This shorter work, seemingly assembled from leftover footage from the longer film, continues the story of the circus owner Leni Peickert  after she first abandoned her idea of a radical circus in favor of a job in television. It opens where the previous film left off, at a TV station where Leni and her friends have gathered as employees, attempting to infiltrate the corporate establishment with their own revolutionary ideas. This radicalism is somewhat undercut by the way that Kluge deliberately shoots down the low-cut blouse of one of these young revolutionaries, the camera eyeing her cleavage and then panning down, to the text she's reading, and then back up again, finding her sexuality ultimately much more interesting than her radicalism.","popularity":0.1997,"poster_path":"/zMeQD8JLcGlF3YrIFzzwC6sY4Hi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21534,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kairos-Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1970-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Indomitable Leni Peickert","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":39303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannelore Hoger","original_name":"Hannelore Hoger","popularity":0.2272,"profile_path":"/cSEgeVHkVQRATHMoFnBPoXIOCuG.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Leni Peickert","credit_id":"5579ee469251417f700001ac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1304970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernd Höltz","original_name":"Bernd Höltz","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Mr. Von Lüptow","credit_id":"5579ee52c3a36803540001b6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1046782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sigi Graue","original_name":"Sigi Graue","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Manfred Peickert","credit_id":"5579ee64c3a368036500017b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39299,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Heinrich Böll","original_name":"Heinrich Böll","popularity":0.1118,"profile_path":"/jqjAooEuBtKj7uKsyOAJbgFgAph.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Discussant","credit_id":"5579ee6d9251417f7e00019d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49838,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Martin Walser","original_name":"Martin Walser","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Discussant","credit_id":"5579ee829251417f7a0001e0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1541126,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Walter Jens","original_name":"Walter Jens","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Discussant","credit_id":"5681429192514131df00e196","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50870,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexander Kluge","original_name":"Alexander Kluge","popularity":0.2615,"profile_path":"/3zC5rpInRtutN29trvMIXJV3cx0.jpg","credit_id":"5579ee9f9251417f6e0001e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50870,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexander Kluge","original_name":"Alexander Kluge","popularity":0.2615,"profile_path":"/3zC5rpInRtutN29trvMIXJV3cx0.jpg","credit_id":"5579eeaec3a3680365000181","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":39303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannelore Hoger","original_name":"Hannelore Hoger","popularity":0.2272,"profile_path":"/cSEgeVHkVQRATHMoFnBPoXIOCuG.jpg","credit_id":"5579eebac3a3680365000185","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20554,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Beate Mainka-Jellinghaus","original_name":"Beate Mainka-Jellinghaus","popularity":0.0502,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5579eef09251417f740001b0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20553,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Thomas Mauch","original_name":"Thomas Mauch","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"573912cc9251414b2e0009a8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1476315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Günther Hörmann","original_name":"Günther Hörmann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"573918e192514111a800118a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0065149","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zMeQD8JLcGlF3YrIFzzwC6sY4Hi.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1412,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kWaPn7FSSHo4D548S4eG3Cd35Sw.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
