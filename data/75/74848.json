His quiet life is turned upside down when he learns of the imminent death of his uncle, godfather of the Mafia, Italian billionaire with a promised big inheritance. Gino must prove to his uncle that he is a formidable godfather reigning on Brussels pizzerias, ordering a director, a documentary to present it as a major mobster. Nothing happens quite as planned: Gino family does not quite agree and the crew is not \"open\" to Gino orders, taking his new role very seriously, especially as the comedy soon attracts the malevolent eye of a true thug.","popularity":0.5414,"poster_path":"/fuh9LzhuyomaGfqV0Iv5wOzbJj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2927,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fidélité Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":856,"logo_path":"/3tfzS2CrX6Ntbu927XzHXEPDA6y.png","name":"Wild Bunch","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":819,"logo_path":"/cEqVIluQuO1ubtID8RvOem4ZiIg.png","name":"Mars Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":2577,"logo_path":"/QZ4zbeJ0sULzGNJvfukrzgx4d8.png","name":"Studio 37","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":11199,"logo_path":"/tWXanyy8XwpcOPannNJ33QUcXp5.png","name":"SCOPE Pictures","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":83,"logo_path":"/9OQ0rm55xtlgX7KcAKMUePJSrQc.png","name":"France 2 Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2011-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chez Gino","video":false,"vote_average":4.441,"vote_count":17,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Garcia","original_name":"José Garcia","popularity":0.9469,"profile_path":"/8KqGjV89hgj15yDeWZkk0FUsr13.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Gino Roma","credit_id":"52fe48e1c3a368484e10fb8b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":54327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Mouglalis","original_name":"Anna Mouglalis","popularity":0.4893,"profile_path":"/jltxoIc4RbHHUneODrVmawnd8BY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Simone Roma","credit_id":"52fe48e1c3a368484e10fb8f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54296,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samuel Benchetrit","original_name":"Samuel Benchetrit","popularity":0.227,"profile_path":"/gXQwbLBHlxU4MJVo8UZK3nzbR78.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Daniel T.
