They can only make their living as hosts in a nightclub with other wannabes like them. The young women who come there often have relationships with them but the underlying fear is whether such a relationship can withstand the pressures on a girl to get married and have children. All three boys deal with this in different ways. These three hosts, the Shinjuku Boys, take us into their lives.","popularity":0.3834,"poster_path":"/iF3Iar67B5troXAc8SEXhV8SBSM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":177462,"logo_path":null,"name":"20th Century Vixen","origin_country":""},{"id":82784,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vixen Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1995-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film about love and gender.","title":"Shinjuku Boys","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"新宿ボーイズ","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Shinjuku Boys: Tales of Transgender Men in Japan","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3596523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaish","original_name":"Gaish","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62b1901990cf510053512bb3","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":3596525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatsu","original_name":"Tatsu","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/nAE2bCAaQXg4vVmAJ1mrX4eDYqc.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62b19032f1b57105611044a5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3596526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kazuki","original_name":"Kazuki","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62b1903c77b1fb043bf8e619","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434360,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Abe","original_name":"Abe","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62b19055bf0f6305f6f8cb96","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1897621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kumi","original_name":"Kumi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62b190a090cf51008d4f361d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1046935,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Longinotto","original_name":"Kim Longinotto","popularity":0.0678,"profile_path":"/u5tB6AkfkgZ3nk3EBtWPlp0WigN.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48bdc3a368484e108703","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3596521,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nigel Hawks","original_name":"Nigel Hawks","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b18fa896386404701d7110","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1046935,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Longinotto","original_name":"Kim Longinotto","popularity":0.0678,"profile_path":"/u5tB6AkfkgZ3nk3EBtWPlp0WigN.jpg","credit_id":"62b18fb4ecc7e805095e2b52","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1046935,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Longinotto","original_name":"Kim Longinotto","popularity":0.0678,"profile_path":"/u5tB6AkfkgZ3nk3EBtWPlp0WigN.jpg","credit_id":"62b18fe2eb0932009253c675","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":935539,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"John Mister","original_name":"John Mister","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b18fc5ecc7e8050a4dc06c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1833687,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alan Bookbinder","original_name":"Alan Bookbinder","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b1900077b1fb043c4b0527","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1088162,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jano Williams","original_name":"Jano Williams","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5371ecb80e0a2672ee001732","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0114427","wikidata_id":"Q7497616","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":844,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/szd1nXObfjY8Co8olPaB9QAnPLA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1501}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iF3Iar67B5troXAc8SEXhV8SBSM.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rg6m4juHbGSu92undjYnCwQzvxM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":233,"name":"japan"},{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":194530,"name":"trans man"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Shinjuku Boys -
