The \"almost\" is because of Dan Dance (Eddie Byrne), an old rogue who would rather drink and philosophize than work. The Village Council are determined to have a perfect record so they connive to have the old man put into the alms-house which has been unoccupied for many years, where he must abide by rules laid down 400 years ago. A new Vicar arrives and discovers that, because of the circumstances created by the Council, Dan Dance is entitled to 6,000 pounds a year at the expense of the village.","popularity":1.3197,"poster_path":"/brZNG28yGfnxfIi2akbdsy6RLZf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1952-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time, Gentlemen, Please!","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Time Gentlemen Please!","type":"On-screen title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Byrne","original_name":"Eddie Byrne","popularity":0.2297,"profile_path":"/9CfcebeFE3EpJ2cibv2XkPfYWqW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dan Dance","credit_id":"52fe48ddc3a368484e10ef1f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":550393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Barrett","original_name":"Jane Barrett","popularity":0.1456,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sally","credit_id":"52fe48ddc3a368484e10ef23","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Brown","original_name":"Robert Brown","popularity":0.3573,"profile_path":"/oJ8gAHNETOFwh1vgi7YiSjX05Cu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Bill Jordan","credit_id":"52fe48ddc3a368484e10ef27","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40952,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sid James","original_name":"Sid James","popularity":0.7056,"profile_path":"/cjldtyJMt8J0nuWwVIuBSn0o70w.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Eric Hace","credit_id":"52fe48ddc3a368484e10ef2b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hermione Baddeley","original_name":"Hermione Baddeley","popularity":0.3711,"profile_path":"/33ZEfseoz0NFa5wB76mW86ed5Re.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Emma Stebbins","credit_id":"52fe48ddc3a368484e10ef2f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":83910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thora Hird","original_name":"Thora Hird","popularity":0.1333,"profile_path":"/bz4AXWd9k7mrFPGi5eImfZxZwN2.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Alice Crouch","credit_id":"52fe48ddc3a368484e10ef33","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":106628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marianne Stone","original_name":"Marianne Stone","popularity":0.3537,"profile_path":"/koHtShEtkbm1rO2YbjfQN3Opz0t.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mrs Pincer","credit_id":"59f24f78c3a3680ef4017dfd","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Lovell","original_name":"Raymond Lovell","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":"/9FjhATIvvaTJ1eEhR8uDlzrsS5M.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Sir Digby Montague","credit_id":"5d1df44055b0c07f3b6d527d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":127023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marjorie Rhodes","original_name":"Marjorie Rhodes","popularity":0.1044,"profile_path":"/h1Jn0YMWgZfyb5AspQb305prB4v.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Miss Mouncey","credit_id":"5d1df45ba13533000f09f05f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":43626,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dora Bryan","original_name":"Dora Bryan","popularity":0.2649,"profile_path":"/m244dIbw7X4okcfSSLxMgK9lvze.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Peggy Stebbins","credit_id":"5d1df47494d8a84bf13cc360","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89209,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivor Barnard","original_name":"Ivor Barnard","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":"/cgkH1MwlmCIzcLg5K2CVRYT13GY.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Timothy Crouch","credit_id":"5d1df49194d8a804ba3c3261","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":107539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edie Martin","original_name":"Edie Martin","popularity":0.1328,"profile_path":"/sWfslzW71MSmW1eAhWBAPNdd6Qs.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Mary Wade","credit_id":"5d1df4b255b0c01c356e047d","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":83758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joan Young","original_name":"Joan Young","popularity":0.2435,"profile_path":"/obTjWWZHHVbEiO8dNfyxnG3eo4h.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Mrs. Round","credit_id":"5d1df4d855b0c0678f6aea37","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sydney Tafler","original_name":"Sydney Tafler","popularity":0.2012,"profile_path":"/oN5ZolUFZYWrqOTaujkZ62kVCl2.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Joseph Spink","credit_id":"5d1df4f3a135337871085736","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":201489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick McAlinney","original_name":"Patrick McAlinney","popularity":0.2452,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Rev.
