Paul embarks on a rollicking, downright dangerous and often unhinged quest across the continent, riding an environmentally friendly motorcycle which was built on a shoestring budget by University of Adelaide students. For a guy who spent twenty years in the oil industry, its a delicious irony, especially since Pauls around-the- continent ride is sponsored by oil service companies. When Paul Carter is involved, there is always bound to be a high-octane adventure and this journey is no exception. This is the story of one man, one bike, and one hell of a ride.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Is That Thing Diesel?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
