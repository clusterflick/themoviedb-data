A rather inconspicuous young man who, however, regularly breaks out of his motionless daily routine and commits indiscriminate acts of violence. When he gets to know Jana, a forlorn young woman, a tentative relationship develops between the two foreign bodies. She sees everything in the shy Daniel that she always wanted from a man.
