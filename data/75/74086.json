Isolated at first by her inability to speak English, Lana desperately hopes that she and her brother can achieve the American dream that she can only glimpse. But her illusions are shattered as she is forced to survive by any means possible on the mean streets of Chicago. As she gets pulled deeper and deeper into her brother’s criminal world while a steely determination grows in her heart, Lana must risk her own life to overcome Darko and his pursuers if she hopes to finally realize her dream.","popularity":0.6007,"poster_path":"/wNiWNkrIeHSIqbuMfn9EIghMf58.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-10-01","revenue":44126,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lana's Rain","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":372883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oksana Orlenko","original_name":"Oksana Orlenko","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/cyiI6fkttjJ1JWAHOrtxx4eAWcf.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lana","credit_id":"52fe48bbc3a368484e108057","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":303870,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nickolai Stoilov","original_name":"Nickolai Stoilov","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":"/dd0hxWQ9VEdFiFYehUB1alPSvHw.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Darco Lucev","credit_id":"52fe48bbc3a368484e10805b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wang Luoyong","original_name":"王洛勇","popularity":0.806,"profile_path":"/8Zb1b2YHxwzy6RlQhFk1HAMKU4h.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Julian","credit_id":"52fe48bbc3a368484e10805f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":183813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephanie Childers","original_name":"Stephanie Childers","popularity":0.1948,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Katrina","credit_id":"52fe48bbc3a368484e108063","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":571145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stacey Slowik","original_name":"Stacey Slowik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Vermonica","credit_id":"52fe48bbc3a368484e108067","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Darlow","original_name":"David Darlow","popularity":0.1986,"profile_path":"/iEz1jid6Iut3FJ2BMUgR79GQaAU.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Gen.
