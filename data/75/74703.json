For starters they are deceived by Mrs. Paterson, a charming widow. Later on, Ribeiro, a Portuguese contractor and former victim of the two crooks, traces them and forces them to work on one of his building sites for damages. Just then, Larsan-Bellac resurfaces with plans to lure Ribeiro once again.  —Guy Bellinger","popularity":0.4065,"poster_path":"/hZ37aBPiNhkifstksufJtyPvHle.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1965-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When the Pheasants Pass","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":17,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"When the Peasants Pass","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Meurisse","original_name":"Paul Meurisse","popularity":0.2694,"profile_path":"/i9YSdeQDiMGoN12aZwsPIwh0tjs.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Alexandre Larsan-Bellac","credit_id":"52fe48dac3a368484e10e403","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Serrault","original_name":"Michel Serrault","popularity":0.6444,"profile_path":"/aaSFvOVwf5tQObbRfdh2mmJuFLQ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Rimero","credit_id":"52fe48dac3a368484e10e407","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24379,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Blier","original_name":"Bernard Blier","popularity":0.7069,"profile_path":"/6xRHGb7CNDa83rcTzCp3LeIvU2s.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Hyacinthe Camus","credit_id":"52fe48dac3a368484e10e40b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Lefebvre","original_name":"Jean Lefebvre","popularity":0.5509,"profile_path":"/4YCnvkYHj1lEk2JZxhKOUoOuJRB.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Arsène Baudu","credit_id":"52fe48dac3a368484e10e40f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":25961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yvonne Clech","original_name":"Yvonne Clech","popularity":0.1662,"profile_path":"/26ukDqbtSK971vy0wR56GQdBkyf.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Lady Valérie Paterson","credit_id":"52fe48dac3a368484e10e413","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Maurier","original_name":"Claire Maurier","popularity":0.2548,"profile_path":"/rlMYKpiTIzZCw2ee3YGENJZQKPC.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Micheline Camus","credit_id":"52fe48dac3a368484e10e417","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Ceccaldi","original_name":"Daniel Ceccaldi","popularity":0.1848,"profile_path":"/7jp7HehQgxpG8GknoKIIBrZIxow.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"le directeur Barnave","credit_id":"52fe48dac3a368484e10e41b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Dalban","original_name":"Robert Dalban","popularity":0.3539,"profile_path":"/r4diJBYpm9agkUO78KDbC2fbCyr.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"le concierge de l'hôtel","credit_id":"52fe48dac3a368484e10e41f","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Dynam","original_name":"Jacques Dynam","popularity":0.2118,"profile_path":"/xuuxdHFeGYdvni0NZRjKEyoMSW.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"le chauffeur de Rimero","credit_id":"52fe48dac3a368484e10e423","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":278368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Castelli","original_name":"Philippe Castelli","popularity":0.1816,"profile_path":"/nGES86e41818SSWkHwUX9SZuXkl.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"le barman","credit_id":"52fe48dac3a368484e10e427","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Préboist","original_name":"Paul Préboist","popularity":0.4875,"profile_path":"/qr9LiZAzH07H6yLhG9LqlskAspP.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Le brocanteur (non crédité)","credit_id":"5cc6d181c3a3684677833230","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":44439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Véronique Vendell","original_name":"Véronique Vendell","popularity":0.2193,"profile_path":"/cSY9ctrzJQoJptsrqW4Ajkjc0uZ.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Jeanne","credit_id":"612fff1ccffeed008e956592","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Villard","original_name":"Frank Villard","popularity":0.1693,"profile_path":"/d0EhMvzu8l3DGoXej0CUddxeoWc.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"M.
