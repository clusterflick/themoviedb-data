FBI Agent Cheryl Hammer, arrives in a small California town to catch an elusive killer. Seeing no help forthcoming from the Sheriff, she turns to the only other person who can help her, Jack Barone, a grieving father whose daughter, Lisa, was the victim of a similar slaying ten years prior. The killer's clues are a perversion of Biblical punishments for sins: stoning, burning, decapitation. Jack and Agent Hammer turn to Father Patrick, a Catholic priest, for help. As the clock ticks down, a young female friend of Jack's is kidnapped and may become the next casualty. The harrowing rescue of the young woman opens the door to a dark history hidden below the surface, revealing the true identity of the killer and answering the mystery of who killed Jack's daughter.","popularity":1.8998,"poster_path":"/mLFeqOfcZ8drMlnuyuWcdT3neji.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Evil takes its time","title":"Time of Fear","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Castigo maligno","type":"DVD"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Crime scene","type":"DVD"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"I ora tou tromou","type":"DVD"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Время страха","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Mancuso","original_name":"Nick Mancuso","popularity":0.4372,"profile_path":"/sGOtCUJed5lyx4eUOFcKbIKVRDI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jack Barone","credit_id":"52fe48dcc3a368484e10ea43","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vanessa Evigan","original_name":"Vanessa Evigan","popularity":0.1847,"profile_path":"/y99zQ61G9LtnyOCTFNjw3JAsVQv.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Samantha Jennings","credit_id":"52fe48dcc3a368484e10ea5b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Basil Wallace","original_name":"Basil Wallace","popularity":0.3091,"profile_path":"/b7l37kEIgMoZQyy3puLi9D3KBtU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dct.
