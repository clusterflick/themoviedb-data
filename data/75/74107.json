In a small Texas town, Horace Robedaux feels the pressure - he doesn't want to leave his young wife Elizabeth and their young child Jenny - but Elizabeth's can't-do-anything-right little brother is constantly talking about the war, and Elizabeth's stern father, who opposed the marriage initially, now has plans to take care of his daughter and the child so Horace can fight for his country. However, the influenza epidemic sweeping the town (and the nation) may change everyone's plans.","popularity":3.4031,"poster_path":"/7R0F3RYClHzzt7HGWUWuCDCpNqI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53380,"logo_path":null,"name":"Guadalupe Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1985-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The war in Europe wasn't their only struggle for life.","title":"1918","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Converse-Roberts","original_name":"William Converse-Roberts","popularity":0.1793,"profile_path":"/43x7iaAJic1adcmpZcX0oZqpQz2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Horace Robedaux","credit_id":"52fe48bdc3a368484e1084cb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":171401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hallie Foote","original_name":"Hallie Foote","popularity":0.2831,"profile_path":"/ahyy93tNJ3rx77dtIm7OSWRu9tD.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Elizabeth Robedaux","credit_id":"586545b6c3a36852ba020b4f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Broderick","original_name":"Matthew Broderick","popularity":1.6362,"profile_path":"/8jO89WNvQRTFUrgXuIGOiTRwbYg.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Brother","credit_id":"586545089251413cd601b382","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":180518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Biggs","original_name":"Jerry Biggs","popularity":0.1021,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Clyde","credit_id":"52fe48bdc3a368484e1084c7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":338123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"L.T.
