Beginning with a personal quest for understanding, the film moves into a year-long drama of human tragedy and redemption as principal character Cass comes to terms with his own mortality and attempts to lift himself out of his cycle of self-destruction. This core narrative carves an upward arc through an intimate study of a place often described as paradise, but which harbours an undertow of lethal hedonism and disillusionment. As people continue to kill themselves during the making of the film, a maelstrom of conflicting values throws up unexpected truths about the human condition.","popularity":0.3153,"poster_path":"/fbzzGLxYXUmP5lTG5zUgjRu36Ny.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75163,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bungalow Town Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2009-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What do you do when your friends have lost their survival instinct?","title":"Shed Your Tears and Walk Away","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jez Lewis","original_name":"Jez Lewis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57b8a602925141189c000757","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1531010","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1763,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fbzzGLxYXUmP5lTG5zUgjRu36Ny.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1175}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7464,"name":"alcoholism"},{"id":12987,"name":"poverty"},{"id":15061,"name":"docudrama"},{"id":158431,"name":"united kingdom"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Shed Your Tears and Walk Away  -Trailer","key":"PBsURhlQbEo","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2010-04-27T12:51:19.000Z","id":"5d1f5f1215c63669bdf3c5fd"}]}}}
