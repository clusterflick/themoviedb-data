Teenagers Nia and Pulpo hang out at the disco where Nia has sex with a girl he meets there, Foxy. On the way home, Nia and Pulpo are attacked by Spirit, Foxy’s ex. Pulpo is badly beaten up but the police intervene, and Nia ends up in a youth detention centre. He makes plans to escape in order to wreck revenge on Spirit, an eye for an eye, and part of his plan includes meeting Nicole, an attractive young lawyer.","popularity":0.7625,"poster_path":"/1lUNrEYXn8hUXXjyw9LDm3Czb29.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5485,"logo_path":"/nN4hD2hrcJ3g1RrDsAIILb4Xwm5.png","name":"Zodiac
