Frequently compared to comedic social commentators Lenny Bruce and Spalding Gray, Bogosian keeps his finger on the pulse of our collective fears while satirizing contemporary American values. Based upon his critically acclaimed stage show, Wake Up and Smell the Coffee is Bogosian at his funniest, smartest, and angriest. Taking us for a ferocious ride through a cavalcade of colorful characters in his mind, Bogosian skewers pop culture, conformity, religious hypocrisy and human nature itself with a razor-sharp wit. Whether he’s playing Satan as a modern-day salesman, a Hollywood producer capitalizing on an airplane disaster, a spiritual guru with questionable motives, or mocking himself as an obsequious actor auditioning for a part, Bogosian tackles today’s relevant, post-9/11 themes with uncompromising honesty.","popularity":0.3492,"poster_path":"/quj8dAS4ntVhj7pS9OcS0lZFEAU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eric Bogosian: Wake Up and Smell the Coffee","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Bogosian","original_name":"Eric Bogosian","popularity":0.5732,"profile_path":"/v64I9bDweZZflNdaBVtOF3p0tB5.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe48bec3a368484e1089a9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":202126,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Rauch","original_name":"Michael Rauch","popularity":0.0798,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48bec3a368484e10899f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Bogosian","original_name":"Eric Bogosian","popularity":0.5732,"profile_path":"/v64I9bDweZZflNdaBVtOF3p0tB5.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48bec3a368484e1089a5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0287112","wikidata_id":"Q7960991","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.716,"height":2133,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/quj8dAS4ntVhj7pS9OcS0lZFEAU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1528}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
