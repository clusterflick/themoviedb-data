Hardcore gambler, Hock Lee Poh (Richard Low) is an ardent believer of Feng Shui, but is always down on his luck. His eldest daughter Donna (Patricia Mok), though petty and calculative, spends all her time and money on lavish nightlife and hunky social escorts - till she loses everything in the end. Fu Xin (Fann Wong), Poh's illegitimate second daughter is born at an extremely inauspicious hour and thus labeled as the \"jinx\" of the family. However, Fu Xin actually is a surreptitious 'Lucky Star' who always manages to turn unfavourable conditions into favourable ones. Fu Xin sacrifices a lot for the family. And in a twist of fate and luck, she unexpectedly helps Poh to win a hefty sum of money. Meanwhile, Poh and Donna find themselves stranded along the streets of Cambodia in a failed attempt to recoup their losses at the gambling tables.","popularity":0.2208,"poster_path":"/5TnTYqI7mlNnG8R0MvX19yWzEEM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2010-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Happy Go Lucky","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","title":"Fuxing dao","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":49734,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fann Wong","original_name":"Fann Wong","popularity":0.3267,"profile_path":"/70J0za6SEZjUV0F1lEdFTNh4iIx.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Fu Xin","credit_id":"5f559fff0443c90036492230","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Low","original_name":"Richard Low","popularity":0.2118,"profile_path":"/lWyJPDSnHvVGGyU5o4HZcfI3Tkb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Hock Lee Poh","credit_id":"52fe48c1c3a368484e109435","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1000574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Mok","original_name":"Patricia Mok","popularity":0.1702,"profile_path":"/kHFjmqCBM3396e63OV8DixuFCTj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Donna Poh","credit_id":"52fe48c1c3a368484e109439","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":130762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liu Ling Ling","original_name":"Liu Ling Ling","popularity":0.1038,"profile_path":"/hAvfshqSWut5XmlCxPmvU22vK61.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lao Cai","credit_id":"52fe48c1c3a368484e10943d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1000725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcus Chin","original_name":"Marcus Chin","popularity":0.1037,"profile_path":"/k2NDewFxeRjKE83t3O9Wf3BJ2PB.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jackson","credit_id":"52fe48c1c3a368484e109441","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1063503,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Harry Yap","original_name":"Harry Yap","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48c1c3a368484e10942b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1063503,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Harry Yap","original_name":"Harry Yap","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48c1c3a368484e109431","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1600522","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/neqIBqZSEDvJiB4VDKT85ufXw9T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5TnTYqI7mlNnG8R0MvX19yWzEEM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":854}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"《福星到》Happy Go Lucky _Director's Cut (With Hokkien)","key":"ICwva54vDKA","published_at":"2010-01-21T05:14:09.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6c4c3a3685448006ead"}]}}}
