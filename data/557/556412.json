Stasi City is an imprint of the haunting memories embedded in architecture.","popularity":0.0663,"poster_path":"/825F4d55q5Kcmu9CGuTkumTbYlK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stasi City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1412367,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jane Wilson","original_name":"Jane Wilson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd146880e0a266191004ce0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1412368,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louise Wilson","original_name":"Louise Wilson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd14693c3a3682f98004c98","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.562,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/825F4d55q5Kcmu9CGuTkumTbYlK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
