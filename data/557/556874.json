Now entering a period of openness following the South Korean Presidentâ€™s appearance at the 4.3 Memorial Day on Jeju Island, the hope of the film is to finally come to a public consensus over the truth of these events. This includes addressing questions over casualties (a figure ranging from 1,800 to 7,000) but also the real human cost and political ramifications for the Korean peninsula as a whole.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"New Korean-language Documentary on the 1950 Daejeon Massacre","title":"The Longest Tomb","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"2018-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
