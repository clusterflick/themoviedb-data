It isn't that she hates the work; it's simply that she feels she has turned her back on her people. Blythe is rescued by an elderly Jewish leader who takes her to a Zionist colony in Palestine. She marries her benefactor, but her heart remains with her true love back in Constantinople.","popularity":0.0598,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1925-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Daughter of Israel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037891,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward José","original_name":"Edward José","popularity":0.0719,"profile_path":"/m32j3Z59YNNRdY2jg2xWNOMdsF3.jpg","credit_id":"5bd0e2bd92514168ee00363b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0016252","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1925-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
