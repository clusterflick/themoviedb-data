A film about integration, cultural differences, idealism but even more about the question: 'can we, despite all our differences, live together and if yes, how?' This film is one of the graduation documentaries from the class of 2017 made by a crew entirely consisting of students of the Dutch Filmacademy.","popularity":0.2339,"poster_path":"/5DcLfCADnFpUoNu2ZkV7JEOOzpo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2017-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Boys Next Door","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2162046,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bobbie Fay Brandsen","original_name":"Bobbie Fay Brandsen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd3a65b9251410389009cdf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2162047,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ellemieke Middelhoff","original_name":"Ellemieke Middelhoff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd3a682c3a36820e900c214","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2162048,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nelson Ogliastri","original_name":"Nelson Ogliastri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd3a6a09251410389009d25","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2141678,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sigi van 't Schip","original_name":"Sigi van 't Schip","popularity":0.0591,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd3a6cf0e0a2622c800aeb4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2162049,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maaike Gronheid","original_name":"Maaike Gronheid","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd3a6f5c3a368210000ca23","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2162050,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maxime Rozestraten","original_name":"Maxime Rozestraten","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd3a7090e0a2622d100b52e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6839424","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rsb0J7mAFXFfLUvpNtU0htauCvM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lhSPaajw03gJi4Z6BTLeR0pxiFy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bFBrmZP4VdEd3NCi8zr11bgk8nT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/5DcLfCADnFpUoNu2ZkV7JEOOzpo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10428,"name":"cultural difference"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Keep an Eye Filmacademie Filmfestival","release_date":"2017-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
