The first is called \"When Shadows Lie Darkest\" which tells a chilling yarn of a man who finds it hard to tell whether his nightmares are real or just dreams. They lead him into a dark, surreal world shadowed by a killer. Will he wake in time?  The second is \"Blackout\", which centers around a desperate wife stuck in a dead end marriage with her drunk, out of work husband. During a power Blackout, she kills her husband in self defense. As police investigate the suspicious murder, the woman finds herself befriending a song writer who enjoys pulling childish \"pranks\". As she tries to move on with her life, she is haunted by strange and unexplainable occurrences. Is her new friend up to his old tricks, or is it something much worse?","popularity":0.1109,"poster_path":"/60xMRAbbzEGwj1WDablq29k08SB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Your Fears Are Not Irrational","title":"Phobias","video":false,"vote_average":2.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":105592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katharine Leis","original_name":"Katharine Leis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Sarah","credit_id":"5bd1d82a9251412af600dfcf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trish Dempsey","original_name":"Trish Dempsey","popularity":0.0801,"profile_path":"/9sTRgxFyRFOwrknKKzxb50Z3lVx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Police officer Janet","credit_id":"6060ba34b7b69d0054e0eaa0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1980000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert J.
