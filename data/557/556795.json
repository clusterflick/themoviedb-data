Besides the obligatory family photographs, from their wedding day until his death Eugen took countless pictures of Gerti: in her underwear, in homemade summer frocks, or completely naked; on the beach, in the woods, in the car, or on the floor at home. Using the Gerberts’ picture archive, interviews with Gerti, and Eugen’s notes, the film looks at what remains of life and love at the end.","popularity":0.0916,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2011-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Photographer's Wife","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Photographer's Wife","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2674362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerti Gerbert","original_name":"Gerti Gerbert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5ee16f5af031740020ddece6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406444,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karsten Krause","original_name":"Karsten Krause","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd2fe2ac3a368743500b77d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1406445,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philip Widmann","original_name":"Philip Widmann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd2fe090e0a2616e500c1a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1406445,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philip Widmann","original_name":"Philip Widmann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd320b292514103940002b9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2029262,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Roman Vehlken","original_name":"Roman Vehlken","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee16ef290dde00021a8e23f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1406445,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philip Widmann","original_name":"Philip Widmann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee16ec74c1bb0001ea37e13","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406444,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karsten Krause","original_name":"Karsten Krause","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee16ee0f36a32001f90871b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406444,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karsten Krause","original_name":"Karsten Krause","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee16ebdf031740022de4784","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1406445,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philip Widmann","original_name":"Philip Widmann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee16eea90dde00020a840d8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1406445,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philip Widmann","original_name":"Philip Widmann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee16ed52dda890020772da7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1832329","wikidata_id":"Q61947383","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6025,"name":"photography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
