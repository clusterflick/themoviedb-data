The sound is a long whistling. The original film is an orientalist peplum called The New Adventures of Ali Baba, typical of the cinemascope genre movies with many extras, wide shots and muscle-bound male torsos. The film's image slowly shrinks until it becomes a narrow band and disappears completely.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"sCOpe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Camille Henrot","original_name":"Camille Henrot","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/eQsi9mIFaqWTdFyi2UEMqFNlcur.jpg","credit_id":"5bd3599d0e0a2622cc004dcb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
