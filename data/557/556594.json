Filmed in Lviv in 2016-17, it shows a complex picture of the coexistence of diametrically different communities in the same post-Soviet space. The annual rituals associated with the events of World War II, initiated by various political, social and ethnic groups, have the character of a performance and, despite the tragedy of the historical context, often cause a comic effect. The film is a collaboration of the artist Ekaterina Shapiro-Obermair and the historian Alexandra Wachter.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/dOPD5qxAfMPCjb0Q73M95g6aG4j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2018-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"De Fac-To","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"De fak-to","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2160725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ekaterina Shapiro-Obermair","original_name":"Ekaterina Shapiro-Obermair","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/jIwg9tPEwSJy5OWDVeLeUyqZYEv.jpg","credit_id":"5bd230f292514144db004f88","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2160727,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandra Wachter","original_name":"Alexandra Wachter","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/zy6FRW1YFm77SdykQ8TDBA2iA7I.jpg","credit_id":"5bd2317192514144e0005226","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2160725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ekaterina Shapiro-Obermair","original_name":"Ekaterina Shapiro-Obermair","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/jIwg9tPEwSJy5OWDVeLeUyqZYEv.jpg","credit_id":"5bf952b70e0a263ab3012d45","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2182346,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Masha Dabelka","original_name":"Masha Dabelka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf96189c3a368139b0163c6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2160727,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandra Wachter","original_name":"Alexandra Wachter","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/zy6FRW1YFm77SdykQ8TDBA2iA7I.jpg","credit_id":"5bf961cb92514104c701272d","department":"Writing","job":"Author"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2160725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ekaterina Shapiro-Obermair","original_name":"Ekaterina Shapiro-Obermair","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/jIwg9tPEwSJy5OWDVeLeUyqZYEv.jpg","credit_id":"5bf961d80e0a263ab8013f81","department":"Writing","job":"Author"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9624690","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cikTtzkHb92tK9tR7Zngb1kgF9u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.733,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dOPD5qxAfMPCjb0Q73M95g6aG4j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jihlava International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2018-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Art Doc Fest","release_date":"2018-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"“Territory of Terror” Memorial Museum of Totalitarian Regimes, Lviv","release_date":"2018-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
