Jerry Jeff Walker's music has led him from the nation's biggest arenas to hundred-year old honky-tonks; from upstate New York to the beaches of Key West and the hustling sidewalks of New Orleans to the solace of the Texas Hill Country - and for beyond. He's been a cog in the wheel of the recording industry's star-making machinery and an involuntary pioneer on the frontier of artistic independence. He wrote one of the biggest mainstream hits of all time and still managed to help jump start a maverick musical movement.","popularity":0.3915,"poster_path":"/lktswwfnAWx6tjxbCZd8VdFrSqG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The
