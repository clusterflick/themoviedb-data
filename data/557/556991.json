Together with his sailor pal Marius, they decide to cheat on their spouses by frequenting the dives and joints in every town where their ship drops anchor. The boys are certain, however, that their wives would never behave in a similar fashion. Upon returning home, of course, they discover that their better halves are just as sexually irresponsible as their hubbies.","popularity":0.2658,"poster_path":"/7CXvlAJ1AgWxRHT0BmU2rS3VWCs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1932-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sailor's
