Nat Turner: A Troublesome Property examines how the story of Turner’s revolt has been interpreted throughout history and how it continues to raise new questions about the nature of terrorism and other forms of violent resistance to oppression.  The film adopts an innovative structure by interspersing documentary footage and interviews with dramatizations of these different versions of Turner’s story. A unique collaboration between MacArthur Genius Award feature director Charles Burnett, acclaimed historian of slavery Kenneth S. Greenberg and Academy Award-nominated documentary producer Frank Christopher, Nat Turner is a compelling look at one of history’s most mysterious figures.","popularity":3.0492,"poster_path":"/r0TzYecDdecnTneOoujmtZSfOlF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94185,"logo_path":null,"name":"Subpix","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nat Turner: A Troublesome Property","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29382,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Lumbly","original_name":"Carl Lumbly","popularity":1.5942,"profile_path":"/ew1URcenWNl1Uclsz9ADiRb0uBD.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Nat Turner - Gray","credit_id":"59a0269b925141774b012d25","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1446014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justin Dray","original_name":"Justin Dray","popularity":0.1544,"profile_path":"/saHYHPsi2FfIrLrNB3MBJUTZvov.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Thomas Gray","credit_id":"59a026a8c3a3684830011c0f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":45445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Megan Gallagher","original_name":"Megan Gallagher","popularity":0.5019,"profile_path":"/c6s5tcndCytgP7kaJelisYFWPES.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Margaret Whitehead","credit_id":"59a026b5925141775b0121ee","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Burnett","original_name":"Charles Burnett","popularity":0.1435,"profile_path":"/798g9dlNawhj20PbP0w5U4eqq.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Lucinda","credit_id":"59a026c7925141779a0123d8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15531,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ossie Davis","original_name":"Ossie Davis","popularity":0.4653,"profile_path":"/ubOu0TvauzO1gdPe7eVSJuCx8Rz.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59a026d1c3a368478f0117d9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1720787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Faucette","original_name":"Frank Faucette","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Jesse","credit_id":"59a026dbc3a36847e5011929","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1236595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Louis Gates, Jr.","original_name":"Henry Louis Gates, Jr.","popularity":0.728,"profile_path":"/3yykjP9JTqDZRIPZFBpHpLk1hFX.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"59a026e5c3a36847e5011939","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1876745,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Kollatz Jr.","original_name":"Harry Kollatz Jr.","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Benjamin Phipps","credit_id":"59a026f3925141779f012137","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfre Woodard","original_name":"Alfre Woodard","popularity":1.1423,"profile_path":"/70AVFDROBAeVhWDEMKWfXPpBVYq.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"59a026fd925141775b012237","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1876746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert Aptheker","original_name":"Herbert Aptheker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"59a0270bc3a36847e501195f","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1061481,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William Styron","original_name":"William Styron","popularity":0.1356,"profile_path":"/rRCsTyENYg7T6IGDpJZY7lQK3Cv.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Self","credit_id":"59a02723c3a36847d401166c","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1650222,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond H.
