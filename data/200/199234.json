Not really depicting his entire life and loves, much of this is fictionalized scatology. Although not without basis in fact, Mozart has attained a somewhat colorful reputation and this is really just more of the same. The music is a joy, but the movie bogs down in titillation. Mozart's last days were lived in poverty and disgrace--stemming chiefly from his embracing of the Freemason stance, which was essentially a heresy in Austria and the rest of Europe at that time. None of this is depicted and even a satyr could not sustain the lifestyle Mozart has been portrayed as having here. Still, this is an interesting movie and worth a listen to.","popularity":0.6543,"poster_path":"/6XhtDf33vUqFdfM0cLXPNzPzoiW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80314,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cosmopol-Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1955-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mozart","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Life and Loves of Mozart","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Моцарт","type":"russian translation from the original title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oskar Werner","original_name":"Oskar Werner","popularity":0.3285,"profile_path":"/lioi0MRwO5ltEGIxzG19BLrcuPl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","credit_id":"5429d7ccc3a3682d65000750","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":51126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johanna Matz","original_name":"Johanna Matz","popularity":0.0543,"profile_path":"/4vekKkD1zkr1lOuNYi1kxaJE84M.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Annie Gottlieb","credit_id":"5429d7e30e0a260a2a0006d6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1287454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gertrud Kückelmann","original_name":"Gertrud Kückelmann","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":"/wMq4tJUVSXDA0uFI8ky01vv0qjF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Constanze Mozart geb.
