But trying to get an audience with her elusive, agoraphobic publisher Maury is only part of her problem. Her first story requires the toppling of the corrupt and perverted administration run by Mayor Plumb and his band of off-kilter hoodlums. However, Betty has unlikely allies to help her bring him down: a pair of petty thieves Volga and Billy, a golden-hearted prostitute Jess, and a transvestite ex-Marine hitman, Sgt. Stone.","popularity":0.8516,"poster_path":"/dwEtqd5wOnqj188WWyjhu6wPiBB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"London Betty","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1473,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel von Bargen","original_name":"Daniel von Bargen","popularity":0.634,"profile_path":"/c8ejpauJX2ZQDreprZ8FHFL7VcJ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Maury","credit_id":"66dcec0e1a6274862f9dc3c2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3108369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Lewis","original_name":"Nicole Lewis","popularity":0.3703,"profile_path":"/jQsJHL351FN4dmXt8x7kTBcRLWy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Betty","credit_id":"66dcec1c3342114f21ec5b0a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clint Howard","original_name":"Clint Howard","popularity":2.5729,"profile_path":"/evKE2FU7RJg0zJEwSFvGvkFB3vq.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"66dcec4b6fba33b2f8f5e744","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Edward Seymour","original_name":"Thomas Edward Seymour","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Billy","credit_id":"66dcec876c9a1e43079dc579","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":98346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Rose Champagne","original_name":"Margaret Rose Champagne","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Jess","credit_id":"66dcec99e050095491c228a4","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Edward Seymour","original_name":"Thomas Edward Seymour","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66dcebec6c9a1e43079dc493","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Edward Seymour","original_name":"Thomas Edward Seymour","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66dcebf6400c5c39e99a8518","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1066327","wikidata_id":"Q6669858","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1414,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dwEtqd5wOnqj188WWyjhu6wPiBB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1862,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8L0vS7n8X6tjoQFaOUhMB3lt2Cm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1321}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"London Betty Director's Cut (NR) - 2009 Full Movie - 4K","key":"OnowrQEnHpc","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2024-06-12T20:39:36.000Z","id":"66dceae80b756450eb497d3d"}]}}}
