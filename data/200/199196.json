Directed by Matti Kassila, one of Finland's premiere filmmakers, Elokuu was adapted from a novel by Nobel prize winning finnish author F.E. Sillanpää. Simply put, the story concerns the decline and fall of a once-proud family, thanks to the alcoholism of its paterfamilias. Toivo Makela delivers a powerfully effective performance as the inebriated protagonist, avoiding the usual \"drunken\" cliches. The overlong running time, coupled with the downbeat nature of the subject, limited the film's worldwide appeal.","popularity":0.1566,"poster_path":"/s8jFlchjruCNGrqHU8JJeaABKxJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12986,"logo_path":"/irP3QrAywIL93PmD9lbhzBMpWau.png","name":"Fennada-Filmi","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1956-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
