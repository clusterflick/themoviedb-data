The little girl's only escape is into the lap of Mother Nature where she meets butterflies, frogs and fish who become her friends and playmates. Her favourite story is that of the Frog King in whose palace there are no tears and everyone is happy all day long. In the lotus fields of Kashmir which is her playground she meets the Old Man of the Lake who befriends the lonely child. Then, one day, when her foster mother's injustices cross all limits Mogli steals a canoe and goes into the lake in search of the Frog King's palace, never to be seen ever again.
