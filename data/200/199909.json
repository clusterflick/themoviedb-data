Frankenstein expert Russ Adams and radiation researcher Takako Mizuno are suspicious. Does this have anything to do with the radioactively mutated creature they raised years ago and that had been swallowed by an earthquake?

A lively, experimantal mix between stage play, radio play and Japanese monster movie unfolds.","popularity":0.1069,"poster_path":"/aqxHPMcWGAzdl9nu5YgOB7pmo3X.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2660,"logo_path":null,"name":"Neverhorst Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2013-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Green Frankenstein","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1180441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bettina Lieder","original_name":"Bettina Lieder","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Various","credit_id":"52fe4db59251416c9111f3b3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1180442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sebastian Graf","original_name":"Sebastian Graf","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Various","credit_id":"52fe4db59251416c9111f3b7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2581477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uwe Schmieder","original_name":"Uwe Schmieder","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/5DrlGMiyuFgS2WR7UAu1Yv0cQzk.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Dr. Adams","credit_id":"5e7f12372dc44e0013fd1030","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1327193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christoph Jöde","original_name":"Christoph Jöde","popularity":0.1034,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Takarada","credit_id":"5e7f1252e63571001458fd54","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1554190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annika Meier","original_name":"Annika Meier","popularity":0.1553,"profile_path":"/76ROddSdkvmALihgFAbW1DNBCmH.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Frankenstein","credit_id":"5e7f12682dc44e0017fd048f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jörg Buttgereit","original_name":"Jörg Buttgereit","popularity":0.0887,"profile_path":"/7mWcREHlwk3ZoAO70j1sErU8ke9.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4db59251416c9111f3a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71312,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thilo Gosejohann","original_name":"Thilo Gosejohann","popularity":0.1121,"profile_path":"/5O1GHs4MlxOWLEdBSY3TdSSEznl.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4db59251416c9111f3af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3290482","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2827,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/aqxHPMcWGAzdl9nu5YgOB7pmo3X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
