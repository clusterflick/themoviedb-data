In Trois Femmes, three De Maupassant stories are dramatized, each conveying the central theme of women falling in love. In the first, a black female carnival entertainer causes an uproar when she falls in love with a white soldier. In the second, a young bride is pressured into having a baby to collect a huge inheritance. And in the final episode, a pregnant girl is \"adopted\" and protected by a small circle of friends. In standard De Maupassant fashion, each of the three stories in Trois Femmes is capped by a surprise twist.","popularity":0.728,"poster_path":"/bflXxiXqfMBRnXGZVGH48VjXPgq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":142,"logo_path":null,"name":"Silver
