Nobel built a massive fortune throughout his life, and while much if it was amassed by his inventions--dynamite being perhaps the most notable--he was also revered for his discoveries within the fields of science and economics. Upon his death, Nobel decided that his fortune was simply too great to continue in the form of an inheritance or single charitable donation, opting instead to use the money as reward for the greatest contributors to physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, and, of course, peace.","popularity":0.5648,"poster_path":"/poRfHZrvQuIIt4uBPpFfKXsT82T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20521,"logo_path":"/umPV6gEtvSiqGuNyXAuuXdGZRYe.png","name":"Neue Deutsche
