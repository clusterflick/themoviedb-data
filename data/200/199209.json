In Disneyesque fashion, the film details the day-to-day existence of the Norwegian Laplanders. The \"story\" concentrates on the annual odyssey wherein the Lapland reindeer are shepherded to snow-free grazing lands. Not surprisingly, director Per Host is more fascinated with the reindeer than with the human characters -- and, by extension, so is the audience. The film was lensed in economical Eastmancolor, meaning that most existing prints have washed out over the past 40 years.","popularity":0.2863,"poster_path":"/sY8M6Wqt2g3uBwZ8UZA52x248Nd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1957-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last of the Nomads","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Lapland Calendar","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Laplanders","type":"London Film Festival title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1483586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Anna Logje","original_name":"Karen Anna Logje","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Rauna","credit_id":"5593b9bac3a368775d00330e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1483587,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klemet Veimel","original_name":"Klemet Veimel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Nilas","credit_id":"5593b9c4c3a3686bad000d8e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1483588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matti Mikkel Sara","original_name":"Matti Mikkel Sara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Matti","credit_id":"5593b9cdc3a36869d1002326","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1483589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Luoso","original_name":"Jon Luoso","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Heika","credit_id":"5593b9d69251410e92002691","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1332213,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Per Høst","original_name":"Per Høst","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53a419c7c3a3682a4b000e0b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1332212,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anders Pentha","original_name":"Anders Pentha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53a419b2c3a3682a3c000db6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0274782","wikidata_id":"Q6488281","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p4RE6sqizko5TDzATjvdJETBLhf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.738,"height":1355,"iso_639_1":"no","file_path":"/sY8M6Wqt2g3uBwZ8UZA52x248Nd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10385,"name":"reindeer"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1957-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
