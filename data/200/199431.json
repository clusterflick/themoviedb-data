Certain that the next war will herald the apocalypse, the youngster make plans to run off to a desert island and set up a new society. This, however, will require money, which is why the boys decide to pull off a \"necessary\" robbery. Idealism collapses in the face of cold reality, as the five youths suffer from the consequences of their actions. Avant le Deluge was one of a group of films cowritten by director Andre Cayatte and Charles Spaak which endeavored to explore the touchy social issues of the day: others in the Cayatte-Spaak canon include the euthanasia-themed Justice est Faite and the capital-punishment tract Nous sommes tous des assassins.","popularity":0.6539,"poster_path":"/1IpTRtLa0HhtsIKsxQMPt2g5VzN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":581,"logo_path":"/pzJLNyKypqwAgLR4OjmaxA5WEjm.png","name":"UGC","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1735,"logo_path":null,"name":"Documento
