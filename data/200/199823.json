In an eight-minute loop of film, Wallace Berman uses Hebrew letters to frame a hypnotic, rapid-fire montage that captures the go-go energy of the 1960s. Aleph includes stills of collages created using a Verifax machine, Eastman Kodak’s precursor to the photocopier. These collages depict a hand-held radio that seems to broadcast or receive popular and esoteric icons. Signs, symbols, and diverse mass-media images (e.g., Flash Gordon, John F. Kennedy, Mick Jagger) flow like a deck of tarot cards, infinitely shuffled in order that the viewer may construct his or her own set of personal interpretations. The transistor radio, the most ubiquitous portable form of mass communication in the 1960s, exemplifies the democratic potential of electronic culture and may serve as a metaphor for Jewish mysticism.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/uN01Ii0DGGumDNj4F3zn00lL2ZZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aleph","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3154601,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Bob Alexander","original_name":"Bob Alexander","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"612671826d675a00635b4574","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3034023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tosh Berman","original_name":"Tosh Berman","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"61264220fe077a0043418909","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1180192,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wallace Berman","original_name":"Wallace Berman","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4db09251416c9111eaa7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1710316","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1573,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uN01Ii0DGGumDNj4F3zn00lL2ZZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1049},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/otA4ZKTSQxvrKPtBBrCTfRO8270.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1593,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/74EOxEuR15HRGMP7hsKMXU58iHQ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1062},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1329,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p4MCs6kNFVQ3HECKVlSZFIdyPl6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":886},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1640,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tDkRyG8cCyZwSqPkM8xdx9o1Rdf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1093},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1573,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sLadbSfUdFX14gFMAbt1UoVBiny.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1049},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1573,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/YqLPhFqWbZUhFVImr36eSNFwQV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1049}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1966-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
