It chronicles portions of the career of heavyweight boxer Muhammad Ali, who is portrayed by David Ramsey.  Cassius Clay (David Ramsey), winner of the gold medal for boxing in the light heavyweight division at the 1960 Summer Olympics, rises in the professional ranks and defeats heavyweight boxing champion Sonny Liston in a stunning upset to capture the title in 1964. Controversy surrounds his decision to join the Nation of Islam, his name change from Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali, his friendship with Malcolm X (Joe Morton), and his conscientious objection to the draft during the Vietnam War. Stripped of his title, he eventually recaptures it in 1974 in the so-called \"Rumble in the Jungle\"â€”an epic bout against George Foreman in Zaire.","popularity":1.6982,"poster_path":"/zn6tyUm9GSKmavxVRUEKBTzaaZ4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ali: An American Hero","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Ramsey","original_name":"David Ramsey","popularity":1.0381,"profile_path":"/bZWO7WfBYI8iojTFozzqN2X3RWL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Cassius Clay / Muhammad Ali","credit_id":"620d99ef41eee1001e9547b9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4790,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Ferrero","original_name":"Martin Ferrero","popularity":0.4521,"profile_path":"/exNDaap66dmsfBQkCf7vHGj3TBK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Angelo Dundee","credit_id":"620d99fdf0647c006ed2fdc2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarence Williams III","original_name":"Clarence Williams III","popularity":0.4352,"profile_path":"/6tzuvVTlBxx0oWjoT3hFTfbVqUp.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Marcellus Clay","credit_id":"637e6ed985b105007aaf4125","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Morton","original_name":"Joe Morton","popularity":1.0389,"profile_path":"/w7rGWWSGKWWukojLbZOQJ5yh9jv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Malcom X","credit_id":"637e6eeb514c4a00d2e2bcee","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Fargas","original_name":"Antonio Fargas","popularity":0.4902,"profile_path":"/tolJfiTpIsVfqijPZ2UroUswwyr.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Elijah Muhammad","credit_id":"637e6f00fa404600966b974a","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78997,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leon Ichaso","original_name":"Leon Ichaso","popularity":0.1669,"profile_path":"/pJwhgEZQjrgeHIK2yiW9U1vn30H.jpg","credit_id":"644fde2023a31402f57c1dcf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":239794,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jamal Joseph","original_name":"Jamal Joseph","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644fde29c0a308031c6fe534","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2215122,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kimberly Ettinger","original_name":"Kimberly Ettinger","popularity":0.0456,"profile_path":"/aDjSnYM8O6nJLWrGWl7cSDKMka5.jpg","credit_id":"6674d045de72fd3277b03e90","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1493887,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bruce Alan Greene","original_name":"Bruce Alan Greene","popularity":0.1414,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5acf1e510e0a2631f70552ab","department":"Camera","job":"Steadicam Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0229973","wikidata_id":"Q4724508","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zn6tyUm9GSKmavxVRUEKBTzaaZ4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"David Ramsey - Ali: An American Hero clip","key":"FRNObGMOJEU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2009-08-25T07:15:13.000Z","id":"648e8e172f8d0900ad34f6bc"}]}}}
