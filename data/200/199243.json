The older of the siblings, Tanilo (Victor Manuel Mendoza) is a well-to-do family man; the other, Estaban (Jamie Fernandez), is one step above a wastrel. When Tanilo is felled by illness, Estaban is forced to take over the family's blacksmith business. He also inaugurates a romance with Tanilo's attractive young wife Juana (Lilia Prado). Punishment is eventually doled out in a manner which suggests that God Himself is exacting retribution on the adulterous couple. Originally released at 87 minutes, Talpa was pared down to 73 minutes for American consumption.","popularity":0.24,"poster_path":"/uZJGtvAuwH08GMS874hcHcBHTUk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67730,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinematográfica Latina","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"1956-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Talpa","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":179919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lilia Prado","original_name":"Lilia Prado","popularity":0.2081,"profile_path":"/hOGwxVW7jHEIPKHUQtD9YYkyuQj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Juana","credit_id":"5644ebe19251410a4c006490","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Víctor Manuel Mendoza","original_name":"Víctor Manuel Mendoza","popularity":0.3177,"profile_path":"/dVdaTfcEjgzW1b9B20UYwxkGLMb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Tanilo","credit_id":"5644ec06c3a36870e8006492","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaime Fernández","original_name":"Jaime Fernández","popularity":0.3206,"profile_path":"/i3EP5OlYcVkIX6YJG2Lhwngp4Jo.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Esteban","credit_id":"5644ec1ac3a36870ef006688","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":145273,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hortensia Santoveña","original_name":"Hortensia Santoveña","popularity":0.1249,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"La mère","credit_id":"5644ec2d9251410a4100650f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":553131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonor Llausás","original_name":"Leonor Llausás","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":"/xZpy3b8Yj3jjzWL1QhHjXSScdzB.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"La presumida","credit_id":"5850b47a9251416cd0010eeb","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2055664,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adolfo Lagos","original_name":"Adolfo Lagos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60adf469ba4802003ff9d345","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1449826,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lan Adomian","original_name":"Lan Adomian","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60adf47d0f2ae1003f4f0834","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":31867,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gloria Schoemann","original_name":"Gloria Schoemann","popularity":0.06,"profile_path":"/h9CmBSbhe19hfpsLocKefPmB6X1.jpg","credit_id":"60adf487126ec30041875bd2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1619424,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Salvador Lozano Mena","original_name":"Salvador Lozano Mena","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60adf4941108a800790f0c2f","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174422,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Juan Rulfo","original_name":"Juan Rulfo","popularity":0.217,"profile_path":"/9RsJzJS3pZAukoEmVCxHXZLbKbK.jpg","credit_id":"53a817f9c3a3687495004702","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":997925,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Edmundo Báez","original_name":"Edmundo Báez","popularity":0.1929,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53a817dac3a3687a31005265","department":"Writing","job":"Adaptation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105145,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alfredo B.
