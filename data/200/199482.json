South-of-the-Border matinee idol Carlos Thompson stars as an idealistic intern, doing his best to survive a very tough day on the job. When not scurrying from one patient to another, the intern tries to maintain equilibrium in his romance with a nurse (Elisa Galve). Comedy dovetails neatly into tragedy, which in turn segues smoothly into heart-tugging pathos. A box-office smash in Argentina, Sala de Guardia repeated its moneymaking performance all throughout Latin America.","popularity":0.299,"poster_path":"/6pevoyZQQ6g8gDhZXDKErVwm7CZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68196,"logo_path":null,"name":"Horizonte Producciones","origin_country":""},{"id":240532,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fidelca (VE)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"1952-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Emergency Ward","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1026228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisa Galvé","original_name":"Elisa Galvé","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":"/epEVeXQMXztEmzT5Mkbd6krLrWy.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6382e07fb3316b007bdea587","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Thompson","original_name":"Carlos Thompson","popularity":0.3271,"profile_path":"/fUUwM3YYumF3a09DN1FHRD78lz2.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6382e08dfb8346007c47414b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1532117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renée Dumas","original_name":"Renée Dumas","popularity":0.1409,"profile_path":"/Y0DxSvfjNqKS5XcNdbgDEiZWQ5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6382e099229ae21572a8acce","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1089733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathán Pinzón","original_name":"Nathán Pinzón","popularity":0.1312,"profile_path":"/81YQrBCRV5CQFqgXrvEanIqjZ78.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6382e0a62e069702a803b1be","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1123914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tito Alonso","original_name":"Tito Alonso","popularity":0.1248,"profile_path":"/3TRtwfkvJwydemvDTmmJKDMeu2c.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6382e0b0b3316b007f3bd433","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":240201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Analía Gadé","original_name":"Analía Gadé","popularity":0.1545,"profile_path":"/iKPt1jA8UVpLVUByoPKophM7vgY.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6382e0b92e06970245e6697c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1084832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan José Miguez","original_name":"Juan José Miguez","popularity":0.1129,"profile_path":"/dLEtmXM2XEJsoEgN6grmOjjwguf.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6382e0c5eec5b50098d11a89","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1175937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diana Maggi","original_name":"Diana Maggi","popularity":0.0644,"profile_path":"/4TqtvqcSVDljCI7itSVfhoIehmo.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6382e0cc229ae21572a8ace5","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1008400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Santiago Gómez Cou","original_name":"Santiago Gómez Cou","popularity":0.0652,"profile_path":"/qHXfz188KBxkD9qPy0tx3iab4Zg.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6382e0d31b157d00c9f84aad","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1737113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diana Ingro","original_name":"Diana Ingro","popularity":0.1128,"profile_path":"/f0m8iAOdljC23IVxmcVbViB1lYY.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6382e0d82e0697023d277342","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31338,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tulio Demicheli","original_name":"Tulio Demicheli","popularity":0.1315,"profile_path":"/fSWlptCXHyhok5Im9N6VwmsNv7Z.jpg","credit_id":"53a680fac3a3687a40002b02","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1194129,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Roberto Gil","original_name":"Roberto Gil","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53a6810dc3a3687a2e002b92","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1898132,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Enrique Faustín","original_name":"Enrique Faustín","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6382e154fb834600995ffa45","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1916433,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Saulo Benavente","original_name":"Saulo Benavente","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6382e1cea4af8f00866281ca","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1325299,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Isidro B.
