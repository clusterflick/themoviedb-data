The film depicts the mass migration of the Bakija and Batwa tribes to a new territory after the natural resources of their native soil has been depleted. The pro-ecological message is always present, but never so much as to degenerate into fatuous speechmaking. As a means to introduce the semblance of a plot, writer/director Cyril Frankel concentrates on the trials and tribulations of clerk-cum-farmer Jonathan (Frederick Bijurenda) and his native sweetheart Violet (Violet Mukabuerza). Print quality in Man of Africa varies from adequate to murky.","popularity":0.2055,"poster_path":"/qpaNzAILgV6Utr8rNSGhf7rtp8T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15002,"logo_path":null,"name":"Group 3","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1953-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Man of Africa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"L'Homme d'Afrique","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1333635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederick Bijuerenda","original_name":"Frederick Bijuerenda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Jonathan","credit_id":"53a819ab0e0a261432005a6f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70718,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gordon Heath","original_name":"Gordon Heath","popularity":0.1692,"profile_path":"/c3WfQJxfxc7EEbFPcwebHt9MS3d.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"53a819b90e0a261449005a76","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1333638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Violet Mukabuerza","original_name":"Violet Mukabuerza","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Violet","credit_id":"53a819db0e0a26143f005d3b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143635,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cyril Frankel","original_name":"Cyril Frankel","popularity":0.1702,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53a8192d0e0a26143c0057a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":587328,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Montagu Slater","original_name":"Montagu Slater","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53a819450e0a26143c0057a8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1653990,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alvin Bailey","original_name":"Alvin Bailey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5790d8f1c3a3684a8c005227","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12241,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Malcolm Arnold","original_name":"Malcolm Arnold","popularity":0.104,"profile_path":"/vpYejsRgYfjBIGSdbosV3lequzt.jpg","credit_id":"5790d8ce9251414b32005034","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143635,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cyril Frankel","original_name":"Cyril Frankel","popularity":0.1702,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5790d8a7c3a36865eb009b63","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1300188,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Denny Densham","original_name":"Denny Densham","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5790d8dfc3a3685b2600b154","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086468,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Grierson","original_name":"John Grierson","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/fVn3DN0fuvw7N4neRs1QxOqBH5F.jpg","credit_id":"5790d8bec3a368664b008df4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":12247,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John W.
