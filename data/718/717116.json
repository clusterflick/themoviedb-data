In the turmoil that followed, a minor is injured while trying to escape into the forest. The officers scatter the woods to look for the boy who managed to escape. Their aim is to find him and cover up the event. When the child's father refuses to cooperate, the incident becomes insurmountable and the officers start to mistreat the refugees. It is a fairly harsh short film about human emotions and views against immigrants.","popularity":0.1319,"poster_path":"/nOCFr7Z3oU4cEvZAn0N3MHsK2FR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56831,"logo_path":"/cPN97t4u6hG6bS76DpsKX7UFxyA.png","name":"Background
