The film chronicle covering two years can be viewed as a continuation to Sööt's earlier films \"Year of the Dragon\" and \"Year of the Horse\". All three documentaries are the portraits of years, modelled by the director himself. There is neither a systematic nor exhaustive approach towards the selected times in history - what has been followed is the chronological order of events. Andres Sööt documents and comments both from a neutral as well as his personal point of view.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/kwqkYVuYUL7QLexCb4YFMWGJ41q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pictures from the XXth Century Estonia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1545900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andres Sööt","original_name":"Andres Sööt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/d4yZ9QUYDZdkje4afIrkvrLqo6w.jpg","credit_id":"5eee149c134d5800382926a0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1545900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andres Sööt","original_name":"Andres Sööt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/d4yZ9QUYDZdkje4afIrkvrLqo6w.jpg","credit_id":"5eee1489b84cdd00352e0132","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1595322,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mati Schönberg","original_name":"Mati Schönberg","popularity":0.0559,"profile_path":"/vcj7qKN669QTfk4BcyssmwEAHYK.jpg","credit_id":"5eee14c7b84cdd003332b4d3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1545900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andres Sööt","original_name":"Andres Sööt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/d4yZ9QUYDZdkje4afIrkvrLqo6w.jpg","credit_id":"5eee14aa134d5800382926ca","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1545900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andres Sööt","original_name":"Andres Sööt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/d4yZ9QUYDZdkje4afIrkvrLqo6w.jpg","credit_id":"5eee1493b04605003510ed92","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1595322,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mati Schönberg","original_name":"Mati Schönberg","popularity":0.0559,"profile_path":"/vcj7qKN669QTfk4BcyssmwEAHYK.jpg","credit_id":"5eee14bcc5ada50031da2b04","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.678,"height":1278,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kwqkYVuYUL7QLexCb4YFMWGJ41q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":866}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
