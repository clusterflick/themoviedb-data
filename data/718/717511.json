While riding a rare winning streak, they decide to shift their focus from the New York Yankees to a controversial investment practice known as \"viatical settlements\" -- purchasing the life insurance policies of terminally ill patients as commodities. Convinced that betting on someone to die has Karmic ramifications, Dot distances himself from his buddies and instead pursues a romance with the free-spirited Leslie. As Dot gambles on something even more complex than viaticals, a subtly vibrant relationship between him and Leslie gracefully unfolds.","popularity":1.4948,"poster_path":"/68SEbXVLUb0QgX1d0GYrinz9Q9H.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Broke Even","video":false,"vote_average":2.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Corrigan","original_name":"Kevin Corrigan","popularity":1.0256,"profile_path":"/obSUGc68mQDvFONalMg25Xw5GZM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dot","credit_id":"5eee94b3c86b3a0036456e75","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Berridge","original_name":"Elizabeth Berridge","popularity":0.5631,"profile_path":"/hmSuiebPLyv24hHIiA1BL8aC1KL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Leslie","credit_id":"5eee94c1b0cd200036b62996","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Kenneth Williams","original_name":"Michael Kenneth Williams","popularity":0.8025,"profile_path":"/kQCO55YZsQGuE4b8ukRsCMqrREh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Kenny","credit_id":"60538f31c433ea00abb7bfaf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Austin Pendleton","original_name":"Austin Pendleton","popularity":0.9279,"profile_path":"/nrXfqtXDDYzSFNLPQnfLkus4I7s.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Archie","credit_id":"60538f459a64c1009fc698a8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3174,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Bright","original_name":"Richard Bright","popularity":0.464,"profile_path":"/potMaJ2u5PRjXZb7qF9lSW1ldNZ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lazarus","credit_id":"60538f541ad93b0074974431","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2066214,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Feldman","original_name":"David Feldman","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605390a9bd990c0076987379","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0208017","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":810,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t8nkjxL9gLJQrMDRpcFTjpnbIxG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/68SEbXVLUb0QgX1d0GYrinz9Q9H.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1400},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3WHG2eBtbpYlJvOx62mlxRxz4so.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
