Cylar spoke clearly, frequently and with moral force about the struggles of people living with HIV/AIDS in New York City, many of whom were impoverished and struggling with multiple social and medical problems. His openness about his own drug use and the centrality of the fight against the criminalization of drugs for AIDS activism make Cylar's legacy especially resonant and relevant at this time. Commissioned by Visual AIDS in 2019 as part of STILL BEGINNING, a program of seven short videos responding to the ongoing HIV/AIDS epidemic.","popularity":0.343,"poster_path":"/A5Nyeuioe5aU1wiUPaQTmj8SJnZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98693,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goldcrest Films NYC","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beat Goes On","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1778583,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shanti Avirgan","original_name":"Shanti Avirgan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eec9773b0460500340b2f5f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2683906,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alan Wertz","original_name":"Alan Wertz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eec9807c5ada50033d744c5","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2683907,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Anna Grace Keyes","original_name":"Anna Grace Keyes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eec9836b84cdd00332e32d8","department":"Art","job":"Title Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2683908,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giovanni Rodriguez","original_name":"Giovanni Rodriguez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eec985d9661fc00385e4811","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1778583,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shanti Avirgan","original_name":"Shanti Avirgan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eec9794b84cdd00342cd818","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2683903,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Amasha Lyons-Clark","original_name":"Amasha Lyons-Clark","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eec97bc0f1e580034b5d1e3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1778583,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shanti Avirgan","original_name":"Shanti Avirgan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eec97cf0f1e580035b69023","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5080451,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Visual AIDS","original_name":"Visual AIDS","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674a15780dc2fdb0523ee803","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":723,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tM185HYL5KsOHrMMyHVWDViOcw1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1285}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A5Nyeuioe5aU1wiUPaQTmj8SJnZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":242,"name":"new york city"},{"id":2981,"name":"homelessness"},{"id":3447,"name":"charity"},{"id":262235,"name":"hiv/aids epidemic"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Shanti Avirgan, Beat Goes On, 2019","key":"372220515","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2019-11-10T18:07:00.000Z","id":"5eec99379661fc0036603418"}]}}}
