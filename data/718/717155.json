The photographer gives the photographs to everyone and they move away from the backdrop. \"The Photograp\"h takes a glimpse into the lives of all refugees who are forced to leave their country, from the point of view of the last moment they were together and happy. In doing so, the director who does not use any dialogues and thus does not offer any description, reveals his discourse on a global basis.","popularity":0.0695,"poster_path":"/vsPhKS3lpCWFNoH75nm8x51yvrK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75040,"logo_path":"/mAK4Bw5CC6AUUmRU0oETWOmQrpD.png","name":"1000
