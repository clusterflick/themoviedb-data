This film pokes fun at tropes of women within horror cinema specifically the \"vanity girl,\" the \"mystical pregnancy,\" and \"running/final girl\" tropes. It's dark but humorous. It's inky but colorful. Itâ€™s a blending of media; film and video, digital and analog, with references to the internet, cinema, psychedelia, and pop music. This film was digitally shot and manipulated with the Sandin Image Processor.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4THREEgc9uQElVyYjFKAVfha7kr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"She Can Run, She Can Hide","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2685689,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victoria Vanderpool","original_name":"Victoria Vanderpool","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eeea221ed2ac200329c1268","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4THREEgc9uQElVyYjFKAVfha7kr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Besides the Screen","release_date":"2020-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
