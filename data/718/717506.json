No one is hurt, and the townsfolk are non-plussed, but the old man is agitated: he alone is aware of the imminent tsunami and tries to warn the village. Based on a classic Japanese fable, The Orchard was made by one-man band Bob Stenhouse, who had been nominated for an Academy Award the previous decade for pioneer tale The Frog, The Dog and The Devil. Fans of the animator will recognise his lush, luminous hand-drawn style.","popularity":0.5785,"poster_path":"/ygmhncQW7Kg3uuYaJ9secM1l9g1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":136022,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hugh Macdonald Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":294,"logo_path":"/a05DY2oSeUOVFDM61RsQa9x9RoC.png","name":"New Zealand Film Commission","origin_country":"NZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Orchard","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1193197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bob Stenhouse","original_name":"Bob Stenhouse","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eee8dc1ed2ac200359bd0fc","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1193197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bob Stenhouse","original_name":"Bob Stenhouse","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eee8d95d2b2090036feaf55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1563413,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kit Rollings","original_name":"Kit Rollings","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eee8e65d2b2090033fe7b9d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1563413,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kit Rollings","original_name":"Kit Rollings","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eee8e72b344090033babb59","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1193197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bob Stenhouse","original_name":"Bob Stenhouse","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eee8da410dad60034bd2579","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1193197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bob Stenhouse","original_name":"Bob Stenhouse","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eee8de53d43e000362e4b40","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":61575,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michelle Scullion","original_name":"Michelle Scullion","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eee8fbad2b2090034fedbe3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1300654,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugh MacDonald","original_name":"Hugh MacDonald","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eee8e30c86b3a003545a0c7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2685666,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Boswell","original_name":"John Boswell","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eee8e51d2b2090033fe7b8e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1177894,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joy Cowley","original_name":"Joy Cowley","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eee8e89ed2ac200329bf04c","department":"Writing","job":"Story Consultant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/73yamshJ9vHpVGLtVXdX0oM7ZwY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ygmhncQW7Kg3uuYaJ9secM1l9g1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":270,"name":"ocean"},{"id":5331,"name":"village"},{"id":6941,"name":"tsunami"},{"id":33673,"name":"apple"},{"id":39737,"name":"seaside"},{"id":181012,"name":"tidal wave"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"Shown at the 1996 New Zealand International Film Festival.","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Shown at the 1996 Palm Springs International Film Festival.","release_date":"1996-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Shown at the 1997 Aspen Film Festival.","release_date":"1997-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Shown at the 1996 Chicago International Children's Film Festival.","release_date":"1996-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Orchard -
