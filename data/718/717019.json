Untitled #125 (Hickory) is an art work created between 2009â€“2011. The work is based upon the 6 minute and 30 second section in the film The Wizard of Oz, from the moment the viewer sees the tornado until Dorothy meets Glinda the Good Witch. This work extends a moment of transformative transition (Dorothy's journey to Oz) to envelop what the artist believes is the entire time of her experience.  The parenthetical reference refers to a deleted scene from the film where the farmhand, Hickory, is working on a machine to ward off tornados.","popularity":0.2088,"poster_path":"/krgZwsqAJbXcKmjdio1oBeaYQb7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7200,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Untitled #125 (Hickory)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2683640,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josh Azzarella","original_name":"Josh Azzarella","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eec06ea0f1e580035b56b48","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9051,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"L.
