Winning National and International awards. It broke barriers of caste and other social taboos, both in the process of production and on its release. 50 years later it still remains relevant and raises political and social questions that need our reflection.  'Revisiting Samskara’ is a journey back in time, in an attempt to piece together the motivation, circumstances and process. It recounts the experience of the cast and crew revisiting the same locations and recounting anecdotes of ‘Predestined Synchronicity’.","popularity":0.1993,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"'Revisiting Samskara’ is a journey back in time, in an attempt to piece together the motivation, circumstances and process.","title":"Revisiting Samskara","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Girish Karnad","original_name":"Girish Karnad","popularity":0.3967,"profile_path":"/vxnh2pdWTdarTUfDoTbJwlUROYh.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5eec107b6dea3a0032be987d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1330365,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"U.
