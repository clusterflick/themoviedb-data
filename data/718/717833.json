After Texas ranger Dave Law saves her from dying of thirst in the desert, the two fall in love. Mexican bandit Longorio, who longs to possess the beautiful Alaire, orders his men to kill her husband and take control of the ranch. The bandit captures Alaire and forces an old priest to marry them, but before the ceremony can be performed, Dave arrives and secretly marries her himself. The couple escapes and seeks refuge in a little house just inside the Mexican border, but Longorio's men pursue them and set the building on fire.
