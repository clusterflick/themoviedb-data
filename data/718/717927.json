This time around, he and fellow climber Alex Honnold have their sights set on a beautiful route up Mount Dickey. But the weather is horrendous. So instead, they end up sitting in tents talking about their feelings. What unfolds is not your typical climbing film, but rather a touching examination into life’s big questions.","popularity":0.0777,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life Coach","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1123183,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Renan Öztürk","original_name":"Renan Öztürk","popularity":0.1096,"profile_path":"/8n6t81MDM1CGmdACuqDV6AtjJFV.jpg","credit_id":"5ef08b0b568463003203d4c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
