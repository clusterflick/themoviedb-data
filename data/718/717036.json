He has explored this question by creating posthumous portraits of individuals through precise compositions of the things they have left behind: recorded images and sounds, papers and notes, artwork, the spaces through which they moved, and the testimonies of friends who remain among the living. Patrick evokes the life of its eponymous music producer [Patrick Cowley] by all these means, taking in the postindustrial charms of San Francisco’s now-gentrified South of Market district, once famous for its dance clubs and leather bars, as if searching for Cowley’s still-lingering energy.","popularity":0.0621,"poster_path":"/4AkkaiGAsPt1bSwbhc2M9wqZr8M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Patrick","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3193408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Tani","original_name":"Maurice Tani","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"611271425c5cc80073bf8516","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":2276406,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Patrick Cowley","original_name":"Patrick Cowley","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6112714b394a87004625fa63","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1102584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luke Fowler","original_name":"Luke Fowler","popularity":0.0636,"profile_path":"/5cu30pcHXQAfgmmdGg1O49sNxEH.jpg","credit_id":"6112715b255dba004655d4f7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1102584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luke Fowler","original_name":"Luke Fowler","popularity":0.0636,"profile_path":"/5cu30pcHXQAfgmmdGg1O49sNxEH.jpg","credit_id":"61127161f6596f008000dcd2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1906537,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Savage","original_name":"Paul Savage","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611271752975ca00242ee6da","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1102584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luke Fowler","original_name":"Luke Fowler","popularity":0.0636,"profile_path":"/5cu30pcHXQAfgmmdGg1O49sNxEH.jpg","credit_id":"61127156255dba002f52d743","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1102584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luke Fowler","original_name":"Luke Fowler","popularity":0.0636,"profile_path":"/5cu30pcHXQAfgmmdGg1O49sNxEH.jpg","credit_id":"5eec173f59e8a90034c603b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13898468","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1527,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4AkkaiGAsPt1bSwbhc2M9wqZr8M.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":990,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oCAqEtcftuYptFxlTNpfFe46IVQ.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":660},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1028,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3Ct8GEQkf8eApWaZvtV2KDaibQ3.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":686},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":987,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tXIfzW1Zgm8ydOG1v71lWqT3Iiv.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":658}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Patrick Clip","key":"534946497","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2021-04-09T16:32:24.000Z","id":"611271c1d05a03007f53a8e0"}]}}}
