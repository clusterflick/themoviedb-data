Since screening for the academy is so selective, most trainees make it all the way to become FBI special agents. You'll see how they enter the program, some a bit cocky and others very wary. Midway through the program, you begin to see a change and in the last week or so, you can tell these people are ready to join the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The film features intimate access to the students in every setting, including the dorms as they process another full day. You get a sense of why, on graduation day, the members of this class feel as if they earned their diplomas and the title \"special agent.\"","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"G-Man: The Making of an FBI Agent","video":true,"vote_average":0.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7852088","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
