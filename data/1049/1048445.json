Dora was one of the sport's iconic figures. He railed against the commercialization of surfing, yet endorsed one of the best-selling surfboard models of the mid-'60s surf boom; he decried competitive surfing, yet still chose to enter some, and floated schemes to promote others; he shunned publicity, yet managed to use the surf media to create an almost mythic persona for himself. Chasing Dora takes on one of his radical ideas--that the ultimate test of a truly great surfer would be in a contest for the longest wave ridden, on a self-made wooden board, with no equipment or accessories that stemmed from the industrial age--no plastics, no neoprene suits, no surf leashes.","popularity":0.3448,"poster_path":"/crFVQqoHi5lEc1S2Vb7oZMskAU3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chasing Dora","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3785773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mickey Munoz","original_name":"Mickey Munoz","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6372620ced2ac20091f21b1a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":108343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert 'Wingnut' Weaver","original_name":"Robert 'Wingnut' Weaver","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"637262262b1b440083221bac","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3785777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Andreini","original_name":"Marc Andreini","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"637262362b1b4400b5434482","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3785780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justin Saunder","original_name":"Justin Saunder","popularity":0.1464,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"637262408fdda900b450f41a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":980328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shaun Tomson","original_name":"Shaun Tomson","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":"/vcjdeBnxJisdu0wYUVjUzAOSlkk.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"637262552b1b44007e606209","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelly Slater","original_name":"Kelly Slater","popularity":0.2572,"profile_path":"/jTOFGN0ncbRHV5h5jZcKXxYBPkk.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"63726261ca4f6700bbc08c7c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donavon Frankenreiter","original_name":"Donavon Frankenreiter","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/7MDmCRFQKV8aNfwRYOjO4GH2ksm.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"63726271798e0600914fb5bd","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Irons","original_name":"Andy Irons","popularity":0.0989,"profile_path":"/we4rM0j2nbQU7YIwuNqKOJrL2ea.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"637262866bdec3007a4393b5","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108389,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Irons","original_name":"Bruce Irons","popularity":0.1095,"profile_path":"/aSnrjeklKv6OkAFcDVibfNISYGq.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6372628c2b1b4400ce4839a4","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":108261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pat O'Connell","original_name":"Pat O'Connell","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/4snsOuHnK8nE78FnngCjZtnSKx6.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"6372629521621b007dda9dc3","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":108270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dean Morrison","original_name":"Dean Morrison","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"6372629f21621b007dda9dc9","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joel Parkinson","original_name":"Joel Parkinson","popularity":0.075,"profile_path":"/ay0HeNH12RjaJnfIGCwx4cS7jln.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"637262a72b1b440083221bf6","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":112060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ozzie Wright","original_name":"Ozzie Wright","popularity":0.0903,"profile_path":"/3Utzqrejy6SWTAaqBy8g6MWdWmw.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"637262b4798e0600dc37139f","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2456618,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cory Lopez","original_name":"Cory Lopez","popularity":0.0707,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"","credit_id":"637262c7028420007d734f67","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3784056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timmy Reyes","original_name":"Timmy Reyes","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"","credit_id":"637262cfed2ac2007feace19","order":14},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mick Fanning","original_name":"Mick Fanning","popularity":0.1725,"profile_path":"/8wKGQ1mqLEOK7j37ncGi4fU93el.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"","credit_id":"637262d2798e0600b4d13503","order":15}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1733800,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"T.J.
