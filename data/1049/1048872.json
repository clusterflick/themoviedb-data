With his friend Jesús Gáchez as the narrator, Matías will soon realize that, like the boy from Saint Augustine, wanting to recount a life in an hour of film is an excessive pretense, and he then derives his effort in distilling his thoughts and sensations that have emerged and have accompanied him during his journey through creation. Philosophical reflections, thoughts on aesthetics, searches to find the place where Art and life itself intertwine, are unraveled as he walks through his essential spaces: his studio in Madrid, his house in the countryside in Ávila, his beloved space in Menorca. With no other script than the one elaborated between musings about Art and thoughts of life, Matias Quetglas builds an intimate, visual and poetic story about his own existence.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"As long as you live, keep shining","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Mientras vivas, brilla","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3787394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matías Quetglas","original_name":"Matías Quetglas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6373bda9798e06007886d1e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18254022","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
