A few years ago, Laura (Chortle Awards nominee) evolved into a full-time wife and comedian. It didn't quite go as planned.  Following her smash debut â€˜Lovely', Laura aims her trademark comedy kaleidoscope at marriage, feminism, identity and the grinning idiots that built Stonehenge. Indulge in a whirlwind celebration of everything that's right about slowly turning into your mother and everything that's wrong with town criers.  30-something Laura's take on life is infectiously optimistic. Her clever tales of David Attenborough obsessions and dealing with a Daily Mail reading parent ooze with charisma and vibrant charm. Expect quick quips, seamless banter and up-beat anecdotes from a show certain to leave you grinning from ear to ear.","popularity":0.0741,"poster_path":"/g2iLXc2lJTebvDdRt9AndCPDhPQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":169372,"logo_path":null,"name":"Next Up Comedy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Laura Lexx: Tyrannosaurus Lexx","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2579776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Lexx","original_name":"Laura Lexx","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/jgMS7EqI88zkAKu3K0S8drvnUHy.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63726d9eca4f6700c68e8c92","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1968249,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stuart Laws","original_name":"Stuart Laws","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/wD51iW1HTo7ccSrnqUFzou3eiMH.jpg","credit_id":"63726db6028420007a1d0ccc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g2iLXc2lJTebvDdRt9AndCPDhPQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9716,"name":"stand-up comedy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
