The middle of the 19th century. A proud and brave jigit Alim Aidamak who cannot put up with the workers’ abuse, works at the leather factory of the greedy Ali-bay. One day he responds in kind. He is fired, but he takes the memories of the beautiful daughter of his ex-master, Sara, with him. Young people went their separate ways. Alim takes the revolutionary path; he and his friends go to the mountains and start an underground struggle. Only his name is enough to terrify landlords, Mirzas and civil servants. Authorities send a Cossack detachment to catch the Crimean Tatar Robin Hood.\r The adventure film, which reminds an American western, was filmed based on a Crimean Tatar legend, which in 1925 was turned into a play by the repressed Crimean Tatar writer Ipchi Ümer. The shooting of the film under the script of the Ukrainian avant-garde poet Mykola Bazhan began in the autumn of 1925, when the indigenisation policy in the national republics caused demand on the national plots.","popularity":0.0647,"poster_path":"/6tweNkK64CM2rP5viHoB20GMtk8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25065,"logo_path":"/ugfX3cgasxoDtUjkmWqlthK4hja.png","name":"VUFKU","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1926-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alim","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Alim","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Alim","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Алим","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3877908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hayri Emir-zade","original_name":"Hayri Emir-zade","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/n9Bsh4mmfSRLAlRpLB1E2No4WYn.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Alim","credit_id":"63c6e157303c8500bda936f3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3877909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Assie Emir-zade","original_name":"Assie Emir-zade","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/pzSGQ0Pd0dqi9YzmlVFu3shocVE.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Sara","credit_id":"63c6e16f6905fb00ae153aa1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4128835,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oleksandr Arbo","original_name":"Oleksandr Arbo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Police chief","credit_id":"64971320955c6501444d6188","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3877912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikhail Arbenin","original_name":"Михаил Арбенин","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wn0ZEkKVBJ0kwrP2WtuIP6qSEfM.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Ibrahim Mirza, a rich man","credit_id":"63c6e1a0303c850082946bb5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3877914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"V.
