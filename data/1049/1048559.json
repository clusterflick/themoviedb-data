For centuries, a surveying method using triangulation has been used to find the location of a point too far away to measure. By determining the relative angles between near points of a triangle, one only has to be able to see the distant third point in order to plot where it is on a map. Using this method, complicated coastlines have been mapped, arcs of longitude established, and the shape of the earth itself discovered.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/3yW83D6SFfSdw5tOntnoCg9De1n.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2022-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Third Point","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2026454,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alina Taalman","original_name":"Alina Taalman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6372b15a798e0600dc372898","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10376834","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3yW83D6SFfSdw5tOntnoCg9De1n.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Full Frame Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2019-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Analogica","release_date":"2022-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
