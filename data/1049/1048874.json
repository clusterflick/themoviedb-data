Godik sought to bring the American dream to Israel through glamorous, first-rate productions of My Fair Lady, Hello, Dolly!, The King and I and the original smash hit Kazablan, among other musicals. Boasting archival recordings of these sensational productions as well as recent interviews with many Israeli theatre icons, Waiting for Godik offers a nostalgic trip through a time when Israel’s cultural boundaries were just beginning to open to the outside world.","popularity":0.0605,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Waiting for Godik","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1702054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ari Davidovich","original_name":"Ari Davidovich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6373beae798e06007fe75cef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1079383","wikidata_id":"Q7960567","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
