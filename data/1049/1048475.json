She's done trying now; it's time to laugh.  With her winsome charm and effervescent likability Lexx, who describes her condition as \"post-natal depression but without the ‘natal’ bit\" talks candidly about her mental health - so concerned for the future of the planet she was bringing her hypothetical child into that she became a virtual lock-in.  Expect strength and poignancy, with some killer quips about a certain cosmetic retailer and a gripping tale about a pregnant tropical fish named Mary Berry thrown in for good measure.","popularity":0.0645,"poster_path":"/kOYb94kd64lATGV5RMyHMiVRezd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":169372,"logo_path":null,"name":"Next Up Comedy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Laura Lexx: Trying","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2579776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Lexx","original_name":"Laura Lexx","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/jgMS7EqI88zkAKu3K0S8drvnUHy.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"637271a58fdda9007fb94673","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1818305,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessica Fostekew","original_name":"Jessica Fostekew","popularity":0.1121,"profile_path":"/etatj9KPuWtMvtwuqnTKU5EziHB.jpg","credit_id":"637271cd6bdec300d57bb351","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dKFldreAZsAym2lji7g2rkaEpzS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1474,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kOYb94kd64lATGV5RMyHMiVRezd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1042}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9716,"name":"stand-up comedy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
