Their children have left for Montreal, Toronto and Halifax and now only the older people remain keeping the spark of Jewishness alive. Their attitudes, including not allowing women into the minyan, and their feelings about the imminent demise of their community, contribute to a poignant portrait of a Jewish world that will soon exist only in memory.","popularity":0.0712,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Minyan on the Mira: the Jewish People of Glace Bay","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2387423,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sonya Jampolsky","original_name":"Sonya Jampolsky","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6373de52d768fe00adf879dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3787646,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael MacDonald","original_name":"Michael MacDonald","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6373de783d355700aade9591","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15469576","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
