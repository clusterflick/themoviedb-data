He found the majority of the pieces at \"Sharpie marker demonstration tables\" and it took almost a year to collect the artwork. All pieces were created by chance with no prior thought. He originally intended on using the photos for a collage canvas piece, however after deciding that a short film would stand the test of time longer, he took individual shots of over 30 pieces. The drone music was created using a variety of simple sound generators & tapes that are being manipulated by delays, filters, and reverberation effects.","popularity":0.2531,"poster_path":"/t1F9q7LlwssIy4S50jQTGnL5oI9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drawings by Billy and His Friends","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Brakhage","original_name":"Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg","credit_id":"6372e9748fdda9007fb97264","department":"Crew","job":"In Memory Of"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1155595,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kristian Day","original_name":"Kristian Day","popularity":0.2042,"profile_path":"/ajFRaRIcOw7qoeIuFKrPBdL2Bbn.jpg","credit_id":"6372e94b02842000a32206ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1155595,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kristian Day","original_name":"Kristian Day","popularity":0.2042,"profile_path":"/ajFRaRIcOw7qoeIuFKrPBdL2Bbn.jpg","credit_id":"6372e95221621b00cd63c858","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1155595,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kristian Day","original_name":"Kristian Day","popularity":0.2042,"profile_path":"/ajFRaRIcOw7qoeIuFKrPBdL2Bbn.jpg","credit_id":"6372e96002842000b44dab1f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1600503","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t1F9q7LlwssIy4S50jQTGnL5oI9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2029,"name":"iowa"},{"id":6109,"name":"raw materials"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":267537,"name":"mixed media"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"A.D.D.
