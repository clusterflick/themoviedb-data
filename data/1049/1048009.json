A recreational area and a shooting range in the west of Asturies, which, between 1937 and 1943, housed a Francoist concentration camp through which thousands of Republicans passed – firstly militiamen, later guerrillas and their relatives. Sharing a leisurely observation with the viewer, the film intends to resignify that space, giving it back its political meaning. But it is not a question of showing –of filming– the invisible, but rather of showing what is missing in what exists today. What was and is no longer, not even in people's memories.","popularity":0.071,"poster_path":"/ovaGW7N8XruAnWJLOqWOMi3jkxT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Contracampos","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3960776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vera Robert","original_name":"Vera Robert","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654d9618fd4f80011ed421dc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1385082,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ramón Lluís Bande","original_name":"Ramón Lluís Bande","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/42D3vwuLJXSWF2kn42tnbjgwRH0.jpg","credit_id":"637107751684f700dd94d794","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1385082,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ramón Lluís Bande","original_name":"Ramón Lluís Bande","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/42D3vwuLJXSWF2kn42tnbjgwRH0.jpg","credit_id":"6371076421621b0091131338","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1385082,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ramón Lluís Bande","original_name":"Ramón Lluís Bande","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/42D3vwuLJXSWF2kn42tnbjgwRH0.jpg","credit_id":"6371076c028420008279a1bc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/ovaGW7N8XruAnWJLOqWOMi3jkxT.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8UDkzII4ewI4Y3ePGTlOIRAQpgc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5509,"name":"spanish civil war (1936-39)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Zinebi 2022","release_date":"2022-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
