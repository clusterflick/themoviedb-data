Lorenzo is guided by his Aunt and two young Venetian cousins who offer him the stimulus to enter more and more into a world unknown to him.The Ghetto's atmosphere, places and history are recreated by interviews to scholars, docu-fiction and a modern animation. The history of the Venice ghetto offers us an opportunity to reflect on the story of an immigration and of a slow integration, an example of the enormous wealth that the exchange of diverse cultures can give us.","popularity":0.0852,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Venice Ghetto, 500 Years of Life","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":928934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandra Toffolatti","original_name":"Sandra Toffolatti","popularity":0.0894,"profile_path":"/gvOJcHPS9jDiFsvQmsClLluYq8W.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Anna","credit_id":"6373bc86bf0f630091fb5368","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3787390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurence Olivieri","original_name":"Laurence Olivieri","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Lorenzo Luzzatto","credit_id":"6373bca28fdda900aade2c05","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1929349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giacomo Del Fiacco","original_name":"Giacomo Del Fiacco","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Davide","credit_id":"6373bcb9bf0f63007fe57f0a","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1538264,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Isabella Aguilar","original_name":"Isabella Aguilar","popularity":0.0775,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6373bced798e0600b4d1d17d","department":"Writing","job":"Story Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1912255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emanuela Giordano","original_name":"Emanuela Giordano","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6373bcdabf0f63007fe57f19","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2489731,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alessandro Bonavina","original_name":"Alessandro Bonavina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6373bd11bf0f630091fb53b0","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4658722","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
