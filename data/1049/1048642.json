My first idea was to produce the classical “auteur profile” documentary (full-coverage interview occasionally featuring archive images), but since I was having such an inspiring and exciting chat with Raya I realized that the “institutional” approach was way too cold and inappropriate: why not present a film theory essay as if it was a home movie? After all, it was me and my father on a holiday trip...  Thus, in my little, amateurish instant-movie I applied Raya's “autohystoric” (autohysteric?) method as naively as possible, hoping to put forward a manifesto for a cinema lived on your own skin.","popularity":0.0712,"poster_path":"/zJD1JWAytI6oGOA1il67OTu2NWG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Separation of the Critic - A Trip with Raya Martin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130992,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raya Martin","original_name":"Raya Martin","popularity":0.1707,"profile_path":"/trdw283Sc4D6zjsjXTTNf07c3BU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"63730ea48fdda90077da11e4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3786489,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Guarneri","original_name":"Michael Guarneri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63730f53798e0600dc375732","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3786491,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Roberto Bonisoli","original_name":"Roberto Bonisoli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63730f73798e0600788679ef","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3786490,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michael Guarneri","original_name":"Michael Guarneri","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63730f60ed2ac20077dcdd62","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.683,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zJD1JWAytI6oGOA1il67OTu2NWG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":513}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
