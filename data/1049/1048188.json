But for some, their journey reaches a fork in the road where they must leave their old, safe life behind and venture into an unfamiliar and risky territory. They are not afraid to take chances and against all odds, they dare to pursue their dreams just to make this world a little bit more beautiful to live in. Every day they wake up without thinking what to eat, or how to pay their bills - they just want to create. And that's why they inspire others. Being a classic Motown artist and having decades of a successful music career, William Goldstein discovers that he posses a very rare talent. A talent of creating instant composition. And that pushes him to start his search for an answer to a very puzzling question - what is A Soul of An Artist?","popularity":0.2991,"poster_path":"/pQXyNuUdmeaFiJwI4VkVWEB82Th.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":186148,"logo_path":null,"name":"Odyssey One
