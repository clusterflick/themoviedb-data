Lions were created in 1978 under the leadership of Roman Ubakivi who wanted to start training Estonian boys when the general sports circles did not think the world’s most popular game was suitable for Estonians.  The tremendous training volumes, successful trips to competitions in the Soviet Russia, tales of happenings and work ethics that are absurd from today’s point of view all paint a colourful, warm and inspiring story of young men, their charismatic coach and everybody else who took part in their journey.  Promoted by the media, those young boys became national heroes at the end of the 1980s and, in the winds of freedom, people started to see them as the Estonian football team.  Unknowingly, the Lions were thus like the ambassadors of freedom, and even more so – the foundations of football in the newly independent Estonia.","popularity":0.0919,"poster_path":"/fjtKV6dAE93cGRJemDAnLtgB83O.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":186269,"logo_path":null,"name":"Delfi","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brotherhood of Lions","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3787518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mart Poom","original_name":"Mart Poom","popularity":0.0331,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6373d36d798e0600915052dd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3787520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Reim","original_name":"Martin Reim","popularity":0.0585,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6373d375028420007d73f839","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3787523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roman Ubakivi","original_name":"Roman Ubakivi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6373d3828fdda900cd08786d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2143009,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kaur Kokk","original_name":"Kaur Kokk","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/vf6LaK7ZpMBYYAbqSlnqphTpQLf.jpg","credit_id":"6373d39ff90b1900b4f51cfd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2412954,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ants Tammik","original_name":"Ants Tammik","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/AdxPVWU5RF5OCoWRBBnPxcqloWt.jpg","credit_id":"6373d43d798e0600dc37b94a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3370325,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Urmo Soonvald","original_name":"Urmo Soonvald","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6373d411ca4f6700bbc1358e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2498735,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Madis Reimund","original_name":"Madis Reimund","popularity":0.1922,"profile_path":"/1S9NqjcQklv6kw0zpUCY2IunPbg.jpg","credit_id":"6373d42f798e0600dc37b944","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3541340,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Meelis Mikker","original_name":"Meelis Mikker","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6373d45df90b19009b5ba5ef","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2872200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikk Jürjens","original_name":"Mikk Jürjens","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":"/npvMiPzPK4jq8XS49Lf5wS698zz.jpg","credit_id":"6373d3b3f1759c00c38a1d0c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1604906,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hendrik Mägar","original_name":"Hendrik Mägar","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/rosXaSVKjwECFPlSBrYNmJKwncd.jpg","credit_id":"6373d3d4028420007d73f857","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2143009,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kaur Kokk","original_name":"Kaur Kokk","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/vf6LaK7ZpMBYYAbqSlnqphTpQLf.jpg","credit_id":"6373d3e2f90b19009b5ba5be","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2872200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikk Jürjens","original_name":"Mikk Jürjens","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":"/npvMiPzPK4jq8XS49Lf5wS698zz.jpg","credit_id":"6373d3f8bf0f63007696a3be","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3787535,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Simmo Saska","original_name":"Simmo Saska","popularity":0.0527,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6373d44f02842000b44e2177","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fjtKV6dAE93cGRJemDAnLtgB83O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":13042,"name":"football (soccer)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"et","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
