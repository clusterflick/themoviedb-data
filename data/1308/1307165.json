Hannah Lindgren has dealt with this disease for over half of her life. Since her diagnosis, she has seen numerous doctors, has had multiple surgeries, and tried every available treatment option. She is ready to share her story, expose systemic gender inequality in the medical system, and inspire other women to advocate for their health.  We join Hannah's journey as she prepares for another surgery, detailing each unique and complex emotion and experience along the way. The scratchy hospital sheets, the flurry of anxiety, the squeeze of a loved one. The hope, pain, and fear.  We explore the trauma Hannah has experienced from being systematically disbelieved by the medical system, the complicated relationship she has with her body and identity, the people who have supported her, and her steadfast pursuit for a better quality of life.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/g9EvZI2M8TMjmyhHVV6T617iLK7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127273,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bayonet Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Invisible Crown","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3592364,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hannah Myers Lindgren","original_name":"Hannah Myers Lindgren","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67b34214317838d2949fb7f2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3597217,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Amelia Kramer","original_name":"Amelia Kramer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6674979c53af75af04c4f7ae","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3597220,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kolton Dallas","original_name":"Kolton Dallas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66749784484b2848a88f200b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3597204,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jake Foster","original_name":"Jake Foster","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66749774484b2848a88f2007","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3597217,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Amelia Kramer","original_name":"Amelia Kramer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6674961a78af22e21516d73e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1891956,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew P.
