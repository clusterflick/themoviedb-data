Sofie thanks Silvia for coming a bit early today. Before picking up her little one, Sofie wants to get to know Silvia a little better, something she likes to do with all the parents. Sofie can sense that something is wrong as she looks at Silvia. She asks Silvia if she's okay. Silvia, a single parent, confesses that she's overwhelmed. They open up to each other. Sofie can relate to Silvia since she too is a single parent. Sofie gives parental advice to Silvia: she needs to take time for herself and get laid. Meanwhile, four conservative parents are outraged that the school play is going to be an adaptation of a movie that contains lesbians. They've been successful with implementing change within the school and plan to voice their concerns about the play as well. They need to know what they're up against first, so they break out a copy of the script to look over together and start acting out the steamy scenes!","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/okwrvBJ3Jf1M1j1rjnV9AHGlX3P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53532,"logo_path":"/1s5JV8QAG5zEkkHnGFiyZB9Kusi.png","name":"Girlsway Productions","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2024-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hardest Job in the World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1956263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofie Marie","original_name":"Sofie Marie","popularity":1.809,"profile_path":"/3eoBeQY4BBjkwOMJ1JKudkzD36X.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66746ec3c2ebaf2fcfa3cc6d","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1731796,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Silvia Saige","original_name":"Silvia Saige","popularity":6.84,"profile_path":"/9IEN9Gphnme97IGvWOwkSE7ebzT.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66746eba1dfb2335e2d8cae0","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1625737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pristine Edge","original_name":"Pristine Edge","popularity":11.103,"profile_path":"/1rC8Mn8PnQA43S7beTZiRyzHWyr.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66746ec05d08c9214c9f73af","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":3510644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nova Sky","original_name":"Nova Sky","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/miVjKMFpLFtCQaomC4VosvizjlQ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66746eb23374e319299f73b0","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":3529080,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Audrey Madison","original_name":"Audrey Madison","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/rmG0dJ90dFWKpT1vsiIP5Mla1zz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66746ead8b1ec1643d31ee24","order":4},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2325523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kit Mercer","original_name":"Kit Mercer","popularity":8.238,"profile_path":"/b3QIl4NLucPGOuXlJCclfJ9PW6N.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66746ea8858dd20e009f73d7","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":997506,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Avalon","original_name":"James Avalon","popularity":1.427,"profile_path":"/s8e7mB9yhSNU144Rl7Ak2rR49MW.jpg","credit_id":"66746eed98aae6f95bfc5f07","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":4513253,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rhiannon Anatomik","original_name":"Rhiannon Anatomik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66746ef385700055a431ede1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":4513252,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Anatomik","original_name":"Dan Anatomik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66746f00f7b572d11e31ed31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9Kyg7oibAA0k0YxQfDHs7HLggj3.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/okwrvBJ3Jf1M1j1rjnV9AHGlX3P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":528}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":33998,"name":"lesbian sex"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NC-17","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
