This is the sixth animation of the series. A morphing type of synthesis occurs when a blue glass awkwardly approaches a glass filled with red. But instead of a perfect mixture, the Red glass retains size color, where as the blue glass inherits an amalgamated mixture, causing him to grow exponentially. Attempting to obtain this abstract growth, the Red glass goes on a frustrated sprinting rampage through multiple blue colored peers, only to stumble upon an empty glass. When performing the exchange on this glass, the red glass is completely drained of its identity.. and now is empty, as the chipped glass walks away full, pleased with its new found contents.","popularity":0.0773,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pour 101","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2324257,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Smith","original_name":"Patrick Smith","popularity":0.1369,"profile_path":"/n9trp7RHyCouEyyp5QHzOSemUh0.jpg","credit_id":"6675184b7adbbaf23f28f0b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lMmEIbrINTRt16uG3uoLkGvNmQ0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2023-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
