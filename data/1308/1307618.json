You're Kaloyan, the sax player. Or Diana, the Gypsy dancer. You journey together through Bulgaria in search of the utopian village Dolphinovo. It's not Sofia, Paris or New York. That's why this story is rural, rustic and polyphonic. It's like a string of painted walls of village houses, folk songs and allegories. However, who is Ivo? And why does he lead you through these winter landscapes a year later?","popularity":0.3197,"poster_path":"/5h8sqFXIHUlRYyWyafv3rVs2qxU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":164,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bulgaria, This Eternal Heresy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2997075,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yordan Danchev","original_name":"Yordan Danchev","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Diomede","credit_id":"667650a625b8d33e48232e30","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2179326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tezdjan Ferad","original_name":"Tezdjan Ferad","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Diana","credit_id":"667650b8cd4c14202f9feb5b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4788131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristian Kanev","original_name":"Kristian Kanev","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Czar Choco","credit_id":"667650ce78fe3dc9f2eeed7e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4788132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Mirchev","original_name":"Alexander Mirchev","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Marcos","credit_id":"667650e74e74e7910d9fe0f7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4788133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kalin Nachev","original_name":"Kalin Nachev","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Punko","credit_id":"667650fd4eb730a58d0d4616","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4788134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hieromonk Nectareous","original_name":"Hieromonk Nectareous","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Nectareous","credit_id":"66765117f8dc473d16ed26ab","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2408700,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Val Todorov","original_name":"Val Todorov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Valentin","credit_id":"6676512730977a91baed2920","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2408700,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Val Todorov","original_name":"Val Todorov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667650125495a7eed5f1fbc8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2408700,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Val Todorov","original_name":"Val Todorov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6676501ebba8e9bd3b0d41d4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2408700,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Val Todorov","original_name":"Val Todorov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66765033d523c7c956578476","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2408700,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Val Todorov","original_name":"Val Todorov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6676503ce9c6ba59d2eef270","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4788127,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mitko Lyolev","original_name":"Mitko Lyolev","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6676505a30adafb4ea6ff576","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3467706,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mihail Boevski","original_name":"Mihail Boevski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6676506b30adafb4ea6ff57b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1596976,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kiril Prodanov","original_name":"Kiril Prodanov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66765078557aa8859934d7e8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2408700,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Val Todorov","original_name":"Val Todorov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6676508d07d7a5484ace770e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3394984","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5h8sqFXIHUlRYyWyafv3rVs2qxU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2976,"name":"heresy"},{"id":266519,"name":"bulgarian traditions"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
