There are children of all ages here, very small and teenagers. There are those who speak and those who cannot. Who walk on their own, who crawl, who is forever chained to a bed. Most of them can only be alive. All these children long for love and care, they all deserve it. They exist, although for decades society did not want to see or hear them.","popularity":0.0432,"poster_path":"/6lWavlW9Mj2w5cvtPwHTieqM4rw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6168,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eesti Telefilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"1989-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lepatriinutalv","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4788350,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hagi Šein","original_name":"Hagi Šein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66767f426fee5f4d4c6ff8ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4788350,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hagi Šein","original_name":"Hagi Šein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66767f4afae09751713aff9f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4788351,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hille Tarto","original_name":"Hille Tarto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66767f5d599914faa86ff8a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1330654,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dorian Supin","original_name":"Dorian Supin","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66767f685495a7eed5f1fe9f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1595136,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Margo Kõlar","original_name":"Margo Kõlar","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/gBQu6eo3pT9eDHcBRBRr0CMduFD.jpg","credit_id":"66767f75cea9d91b832480b2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3260635,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vambola Velli-Vällik","original_name":"Vambola Velli-Vällik","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/jwkiy8MUtU185zJHt2YcUckm9uS.jpg","credit_id":"66767f8424be53e93bd71efb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":137611,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kaie-Ene Rääk","original_name":"Kaie-Ene Rääk","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/qvbBA8rx7NMMMO2PwYGaklR6sO.jpg","credit_id":"66767f8f83b7693b9dd7dc6d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"et","file_path":"/6lWavlW9Mj2w5cvtPwHTieqM4rw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-08-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
