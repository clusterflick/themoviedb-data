Will he be able to \"face\" the reflection of an undefiled love with the maturity of the moments that hurt, doubled by the remorse that haunts his being?!\r Can we of the present give up the sincerity that moved us in the past? It is very clear that the need for healing exists within each of us. Can we or can't we, run away or not?!","popularity":0.0496,"poster_path":"/MSPel7e3N3JQlEk3j3YGSv6bS1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Viața unei singure femei","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31448844","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ro","file_path":"/MSPel7e3N3JQlEk3j3YGSv6bS1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
