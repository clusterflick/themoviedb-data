Spared by the ice-age, overlooked by an expanding civilisation for hundreds of years, saved at the last minute from a total sell out to tourism – that is the still little known Carinthian ‘Nockberge’ region.  The soft green Nocken bring Ireland to mind, their high plateaux the bright expanse of Castilia. Right up to the summit regions herds of cattle and large deer herds graze together, alpine virgin forests overgrow dilapidated mines. Wild nature and the ancient culture of mountain farming distinguish the character of the Nockberge National Park.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Green Islands In A Sea Of Stone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
