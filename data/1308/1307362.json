The lives of men and women slip under its fronds, often unaware of how much their existence depends on its presence. This is the story of s'ozzastru and of the generous and solid land that welcomed it.  In 2021 in Sardinia, a thousand-year-old wild olive tree burned. This fire devasted 70.000 acres of land and houses. Thousands of animals died, suffocated or burned alive.A year later, the tree sprouted again, becoming a symbol of resilience. Every year, around the world, 7 millions of acres of land are destroyed in over 60.000 fires, almost all caused by human hand.","popularity":0.2432,"poster_path":"/uZPzzDVfkMKeOWBs1jC6lNgpdrg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2023-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Sardinian","iso_639_1":"sc","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"S'Ozzastru","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4786907,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudia
