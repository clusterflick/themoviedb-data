No shell, no person. But is it really true? Maybe a person is not just bones and meat, but something more? Memories, textures, states? We still don't know, because everyone puts their own meaning into life. This is about a man's attempt to reassemble himself by his organs, which makes him a simple piece of meat. Only by remembering the insignificant moments of his life, which make up every minute of it, does he become a Human Being.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/2ZwfyQ13qrV2xMrHAqyW9bJh615.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2024-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"HOMO","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4787948,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sofiia Rozhok","original_name":"Sofiia Rozhok","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66760f86e6b92212aec4a56c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4787949,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nikita Kruk","original_name":"Nikita Kruk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66760f964ac66183a277deb5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4787947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lubov Bekhter","original_name":"Lubov Bekhter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66760f67e88bf95e499a989a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4787947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lubov Bekhter","original_name":"Lubov Bekhter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66760f72f3b3616c9f2313e3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32667162","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2ZwfyQ13qrV2xMrHAqyW9bJh615.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Mykolaichuk OPEN Audience Film Festival","release_date":"2024-06-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ZMINA Kyiv International Liberty Film Festival","release_date":"2024-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
