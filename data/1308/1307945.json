The film unfolds narratives of five queer migrants from contexts outside of the Global North which have been marked by gender violence, homophobia, economic instability, and social misbalance. Beyond narratives of damage, marginality is lived through and treated in the film as a space for emancipation and resistance – full of humor and joy, dignity and erotic, emancipation and struggle.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/nh3wuYYzC1yJxT5dJOiI5neTPe4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Countryless and Queer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4789946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masha Godovannaya","original_name":"Masha Godovannaya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6677be81ba3378eba6235062","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1533250,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masha Godovannaya","original_name":"Masha Godovannaya","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/yoGyCAOzzVTAN21U6ywj7IVBHxc.jpg","credit_id":"6677be1147202a4de0c21eee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8XZobCXeRFTzIV0ZUS4IwE8Lr6Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nh3wuYYzC1yJxT5dJOiI5neTPe4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
