The Shackleton-Rowett Expedition and their ship the Quest docked at the old whaling station at Grytviken, South Georgia, on 4 January 1922; Shackleton died of a heart attack on board in the early hours of 5 January. These scenes of wildlife on the remote island – including skewers, fulmars, penguins and seals – were shot before the Quest departed on 18 January.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1920-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shackleton South Georgia Birds","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4785670,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hubert Wilkins","original_name":"Hubert Wilkins","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/qSvQaoWB2bGiqMwhuGutqRP4YBh.jpg","credit_id":"667470893c58f757d231ed80","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4785670,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hubert Wilkins","original_name":"Hubert Wilkins","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/qSvQaoWB2bGiqMwhuGutqRP4YBh.jpg","credit_id":"66c38f64f63be44316567f44","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1920-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
