The mockumentary, or docu’mundu’ary, details the cycle of life for a community and a garment that are bound at the hips from birth till death. The seemingly minimalistic apparel often acts as nuanced dialogue depending on context and its use. The four-minute short tries to explore the role of the mundu as a part of the culture, identity, and social relationships of the Malayali. It offers a peek into the social fabric of the Malayali using satire and puns woven into the monologue.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malayalam","iso_639_1":"ml","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mundu and the Malayali","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4786362,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rahul Dileep","original_name":"Rahul Dileep","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6674e5559400e76a1c6c71e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
