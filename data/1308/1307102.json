Following conversations between the filmmaker, her parents, and a local driver during one winter afternoon in Karachi, the film uncovers the bittersweet experience of communities who settle abroad, and return to a city that, like them, has changed through the years. The film is an ode to the cities we love and remember— and the seven seas we must constantly cross to remain forever connected to the places we call home.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PK","name":"Pakistan"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Karachi, With Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4785659,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zaynah Waseem","original_name":"Zaynah Waseem","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667470296f1a1f7f458f1ead","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"VC Film Fest 2024","release_date":"2024-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
