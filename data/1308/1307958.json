Political processes no longer seem to be necessary in this AI-driven, totalitarian and cosy government; instead, identity-forming collectives distinguish themselves from each other solely by subtle behavioural differences. Until a threat looms on the horizon: the Broken Hearts Collective disquiets the solar system with terrorist attacks – a development at the centre of which Marten Eliot and Emma Glendale, young head fellows of the Dolphin Collective, unexpectedly find themselves.","popularity":0.0926,"poster_path":"/cOBZIZ4WxT33MYpO0TGmkAmct1g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":182480,"logo_path":null,"name":"Münchner
