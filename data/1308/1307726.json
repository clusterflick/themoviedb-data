The film savors the couple's final moment together while inviting the audience to surmise the inescapable and unsavory past that brought John and Karen to this point.  LIABILITY is an existential, absurdist joy ride that gleefully tests the audience's ability to suspend disbelief effectively. The result is part satire of the crimes-of-passion genre and homage to the banality of movie-making tropes of decades past.","popularity":0.1516,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Liability","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5054277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Bartel","original_name":"Jeremy Bartel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"John Wallet Spooks","credit_id":"6732f8651c7bcbabb4156761","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1655462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amber Emery","original_name":"Amber Emery","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Karen Spooks","credit_id":"6732f89dbc78ce2b94ba4b4e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4607166,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Travis Aitken","original_name":"Travis Aitken","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6676de51d182b135982b3878","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3421353,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nick Patronella","original_name":"Nick Patronella","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6676de727b06c84a4b248449","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4607166,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Travis Aitken","original_name":"Travis Aitken","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6676de4bf7719f0920f2054a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4788784,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jessica Cramer","original_name":"Jessica Cramer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6676de66ddc5f76881b09553","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Oak Cliff Film Festival","release_date":"2024-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ATX Short Film Showcase","release_date":"2024-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
