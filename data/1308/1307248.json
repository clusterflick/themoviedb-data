The film links the process of reconstruction and fighting of the Esquipulas Guayabal community--located 5 kilometers from the crater of the volcano--with the complex cosmogony of volcanic regions. This collaboration between two visual artists and a Zoque poet from Guayabal community, seeks to trigger a process of sensory ethnography and audiovisual experimentation, that manifest the strong relationship between the historical process of the community life and the volcano activity that has increased recently. The historical link between humans and volcanoes acquires a visual-cinematographic form of territorial redefinition and renewal of volcanic imaginaries, leaving aside the melancholy of what has been lost. The film embodies the genesis of a new way of living and conceiving the volcano.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/aP38Dy3BBtCerRBaJhkAWONqBI3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2017-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tsuan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1742497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yollótl Alvarado","original_name":"Yollótl Alvarado","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6674e44f476b0bc3eb16ded1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3287373,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tania Ximena Ruiz","original_name":"Tania Ximena Ruiz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6674e459a72fc3048692d526","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3287393,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carlos Edelmiro","original_name":"Carlos Edelmiro","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6674e5817f61a80eb2b0459c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9854102","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aP38Dy3BBtCerRBaJhkAWONqBI3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Tsuan \" El momento mas obscuro de la noche\"","key":"147201971","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2015-11-28T23:48:49.000Z","id":"6674e4ea496e6d2eb56c74a0"}]}}}
