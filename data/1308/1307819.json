For years now, the growth of esports has been one of the defining stories of entertainment . And at the center of all that growth has been FaZe Clan, an organization that’s gone from the brainchild of a few gamers streaming their play on the internet to publicly traded company with teams and players all around the globe competing professionally in an array of games. The film explores questions about the costs of their rapid growth and extraordinary success. As FaZe has come to encompass stars and performers from the traditional sports and entertainment worlds, even in the wake of the company’s public offering, the financial viability of the whole enterprise hardly appears stable. Through it all, esports are undoubtedly here to stay. But “No Scope” makes clear that the path from here is anything but assured.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/iTPDnvrjb8GxlpCR2fBfdiOLFEn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":158748,"logo_path":"/ng3lP36qnejNNBiYxUvSsCVC1sC.png","name":"Words + Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Scope: The Story of FaZe Clan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2564508,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justin Staple","original_name":"Justin Staple","popularity":0.1498,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6677244decb5bc88e7f20adc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32368140","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":729,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x3zEl4R8mivnrnfxGcluuC8PVDC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1296},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yFHuSXukqw4edT0Eo2xMXpVAIzY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":803,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iTPDnvrjb8GxlpCR2fBfdiOLFEn.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":535},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yyga23Co3Ue0OEpvy1hrKa0vwhT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1179}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ESPN 30 for 30","release_date":"2024-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
