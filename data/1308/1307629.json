He attempts to escape but a guard shoots him. But a woman appears to save him. She is a student studying at Kim Il-Sung University. While his wound gets healed, he falls in love with her. She is also an anti-Communist. When he becomes healthy again, he sneaks into the Pyeongyang concentration camp to rescue three South Korean soldiers even though she strongly objects. He successfully carries out his mission and they set out for Seoul. But there are a lot of dangers waiting for them on their way.","popularity":0.1813,"poster_path":"/trqX4uw7DvwYP2pciRXpZd4j61L.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"1962-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Way to Seoul","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":132440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Jin-kyu","original_name":"김진규","popularity":0.2224,"profile_path":"/pMoWVrCejrUGIsp8CJKq5Nk7sdV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Major Kang","credit_id":"66765d89b7cae0223e2b325a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1076617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Ji-mi","original_name":"김지미","popularity":0.25,"profile_path":"/vBPyW3DICoE1YSXiqLmO0hSjN41.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Myungshin","credit_id":"66765dd1b7cae0223e2b3262","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1079603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoon Il-bong","original_name":"윤일봉","popularity":0.2199,"profile_path":"/1IpWthPJeVVbzUeRzNUnibHaakn.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Major Lee","credit_id":"66765de28c80ba3cc9b0906f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1419438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hwang Hae","original_name":"황해","popularity":0.142,"profile_path":"/39H7mlQEyjOrlG44c5zZBNBvoqL.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Captain Kim","credit_id":"66765dfc46ffb8a89d3afd10","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1171916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Dae-yub","original_name":"이대엽","popularity":0.1071,"profile_path":"/k34R8bRmA9M6VsTAg5bJVjyaXIb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Master Sergeant Park","credit_id":"66765e2ff65fdcca62bc062b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":548682,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Byung-il","original_name":"이병일","popularity":0.0733,"profile_path":"/a5vdJRBbr3ZJRGjemXOXQiHPjSN.jpg","credit_id":"66765e82e9c6ba59d2eef3f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":548682,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Byung-il","original_name":"이병일","popularity":0.0733,"profile_path":"/a5vdJRBbr3ZJRGjemXOXQiHPjSN.jpg","credit_id":"66765f59c659cb028c6ff65f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1758129,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hong Dong-hyuk","original_name":"홍동혁","popularity":0.0456,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66765f8e35829285b73aff67","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":1247,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/trqX4uw7DvwYP2pciRXpZd4j61L.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":828}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"1962-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
