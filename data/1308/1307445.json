With money raised from individuals and organizations in our community a busload of over 50 youth and adults left Chestertown, MD in the wee hours of August 25 to transport the soil sample to the Legacy Museum in Montgomery. The trip included visits to important civil rights sites in Birmingham, Selma, Montgomery and Atlanta. Participants were confronted with a reality not often taught or talked about, and subsequently witnessed, processed, and transformed their perspectives on both Black History in the USA of the past, and the African American Experience of today. Get on the Bus is a film about this trip.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/pmpifkpYlgE64SBgK5G6Vz6MvMv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":231918,"logo_path":null,"name":"Andover Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-04","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Get on the Bus!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4787388,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justinian Dispenza","original_name":"Justinian Dispenza","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6675a58bbe538efb833f7fab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4787388,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justinian Dispenza","original_name":"Justinian Dispenza","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6675a5961eb93bc9534ee97a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30459864","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":937,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pmpifkpYlgE64SBgK5G6Vz6MvMv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":625}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
