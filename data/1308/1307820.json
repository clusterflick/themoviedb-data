There in January 1975 the Israeli forces attacked the Lebanese village of Kfar Chouba. Israel said it was a retaliation. It was its way of expressing its discontent with the political successes gained by the PLO, culminating in the speech of Yasser Arafat before the General Assembly of the United Nations in November 1974. The film shows some fragments of this speech.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/wbwBwk56KMCdKwI5E2OWAGSF7s1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151615,"logo_path":null,"name":"Palestinian Cinema Institute","origin_country":"PS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kufr Shuba","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Kufr Chouba","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Kafr Shoba","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3222987,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samir Nimr","original_name":"Samir Nimr","popularity":0.0364,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667723bb36dd7dab14bdee24","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4880970,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rasmi Abou Ali","original_name":"Rasmi Abou Ali","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6706ead8ede1413b85e54012","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3222987,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samir Nimr","original_name":"Samir Nimr","popularity":0.0364,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6706eae53abedc1d3b6a256b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3222987,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samir Nimr","original_name":"Samir Nimr","popularity":0.0364,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6706eaed4d7a645f93522b4d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wbwBwk56KMCdKwI5E2OWAGSF7s1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
