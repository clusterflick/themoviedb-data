This film captures Lord Frederick Roberts (British Army rank Field Marshal) departing England for South Africa on 23rd December 1899, where he commanded British forces for a year in the Second Boer War. The ship in this film is the RMS Dunottar Castle. Going with Roberts is his chief of staff, Lord Kitchener, whose future role as Secretary Of State for War during World War One awaits him.  This film was produced and distributed by the Warwick Trading Company, a London based company at its peak at this time, involved in the majority of British films.The Warwick Trading Company specialised in travel, reportage and actuality films and had substantial catalogues. Charles Urban had taken over as managing director in 1897 and was in that role when this film was produced. According to the BFI programme entry, the company had a large amount of resources already in South Africa. This meant they could capture historic moments as part of its Boer War coverage.","popularity":0.6576,"poster_path":"/fv3CKIq7ZD6j0fxUwmpR998DbLs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19681,"logo_path":null,"name":"Warwick Trading Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1899-12-23","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lord Roberts Leaving For South Africa","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4787315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lord Frederick Roberts","original_name":"Lord Frederick Roberts","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"66759e8e83515d7e12fc7e1d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4787338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberts, Lady Nora Henrietta (1838-1920)","original_name":"Roberts, Lady Nora Henrietta (1838-1920)","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6675a0599f1ebf26e7c523f8","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fv3CKIq7ZD6j0fxUwmpR998DbLs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":534}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4100,"name":"british army"},{"id":207928,"name":"19th century"},{"id":231094,"name":"boer war"},{"id":305021,"name":"1890s"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Warwick Catalogue No. 5521","release_date":"1899-12-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
