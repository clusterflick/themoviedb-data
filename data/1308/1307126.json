We see what it means for blackness to expand inter-dimensionally, this is a practice for the black mind/body in imagination. A collective body of blackness spanning throughout the east coast of the US takes time to show you where Mars is and opens the door to bring you with. This project is a demonstration of fantasy amidst a formal structure that does not always permit it. Where are we going? Are you coming? Enjoy this film as moment to fall into rest as we see the multiplicity of realities fold and bend, we are traveling into the beyond and perhaps not coming back.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Are Going To Mars","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3979952,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yaz Josiah","original_name":"Yaz Josiah","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6674800ad4db5afa758f20b2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3979952,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yaz Josiah","original_name":"Yaz Josiah","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6674800217265dc1cfc4f6db","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4785747,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Symara Johnson","original_name":"Symara Johnson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66747fe36f1a1f7f458f1f50","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
