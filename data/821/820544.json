In his Tempestaire (2020), Jacques Perconte digitally interprets the meteorological imagery of Jean Epstein's film Le Tempestaire (1947). After capturing images of a storm in Cap Fagnet, Normandy, Perconte translates the atmospheric vibrations of the elements and colours of nature into vibrations of digital images whose pixellized textures and deconstructed take on a pictorial dimension reminiscent of the landscape painting of Romanticism and Impressionism. Perconte's work is a generative video in which images, constantly fed by software, never repeat themselves. The duration of the video is therefore potentially unlimited.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Tempestaire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1417705,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Perconte","original_name":"Jacques Perconte","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":"/oFRS8RjhboOOKhQK8j4sVWF25lS.jpg","credit_id":"607dca392b8a43006ca123b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
