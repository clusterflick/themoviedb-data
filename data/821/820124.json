But after he graduated, he was overwhelmed by work pressure. When Wang Ke was most helpless, he developed a robot that he developed many years ago. The artificial intelligence robot \"Ke Ji NO.239\" appeared to rescue him, and after a series of setbacks, Wang Ke finally recovered the story of dreams and hope. The style of the film is cheerful and bright, combining science fiction and urban elements. By focusing on the large number of graduates in reality, it shows the confusion of their first entry into society and the ambivalence of facing dreams and reality.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/gEag5mzoXhNUIGk2s5YL8zvz3Ky.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2020-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"梦想的科姬","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3058017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zhou Xuanyu","original_name":"Zhou Xuanyu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"607c4322e04d8a0059c32432","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4204604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Li Xin","original_name":"Li Xin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65fe94b0770700017c0c7452","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3058016,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lin Liyuan","original_name":"Lin Liyuan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607c431a43d9b1003fdfd6c5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3058015,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liu Wenjun","original_name":"Liu Wenjun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607c43149408ec0057c1dc5d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gEag5mzoXhNUIGk2s5YL8zvz3Ky.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
