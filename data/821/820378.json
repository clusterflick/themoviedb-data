Instead of focusing on paralyzing facts and numbers this inspiring feature takes a unique approach by following passionate activists, ages 15-72, who are in the trenches fighting for a livable future. These brave climate warriors put their lives on the line to push for change, regardless of the personal cost. Emmy award-winning filmmaker Joe Gantz brings an urgent and intimate portrait of the protests, arrests, courtroom drama and family turmoil these activists endure as they single mindedly focus their attention on the goal of creating a more sustainable world for future generations. The Race To Save The World is an inspiring and energizing call-to-action to quit waiting on the sidelines and make our voices heard.","popularity":0.0958,"poster_path":"/apAqJLBu1FGI6wZ6nLpJXuTKJAG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Race to Save the World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157141,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joe Gantz","original_name":"Joe Gantz","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/sK3MbL0nKF1h25Ko0R5ejCJqXR4.jpg","credit_id":"618d41fcddd52d0026c5c4d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3663052","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xN2hO5qBqT40N4NhahmqYVQZDCt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/apAqJLBu1FGI6wZ6nLpJXuTKJAG.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2769,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/j1KinXOiO2c0A9YBaMi8duRqQD5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1846}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
