We all catch ourselves way too often thinking \"Today sucks\" or \"Why me\". And we all probably know that most of the time the only thing we need to do to feel better is to take a few deep breaths to reset our mind and to calm down. Way too often we get tangled inside our own thoughts and emotions instead of taking a step back to think. But what if you had a really bad day? Have you ever managed to miss four busses in a row? This is the story of Mr. Kurz, our main character. A stressed businessman on the way to work who goes through hell in any way you can imagine. A choleric workaholic with a guidebook for mindfulness, trying to stay calm on probably his worst day ever.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BUS STOP","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
