Funny how a 30-year-marriage can sound so different when described by separate parties in separate interviews. Wang captures her parents’ broken marriage with a carefree, humorous yet somehow also critical perspective, lacing her film with pop music from their generation.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/4GS9UQroqoyyTcfaRD2qBtAwJwV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"More Than One Is Unhappy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3057896,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wang Fen","original_name":"Wang Fen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607c2c58746457003fdadea9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4GS9UQroqoyyTcfaRD2qBtAwJwV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
