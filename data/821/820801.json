Since then, the wilderness on the shore of the Polish Lake Solina - far away from civilization - has been their home.\r In his small apartment in Masuria, Juliusz, 91, dreams of summer. All he wants is to escape to his cabin in the Carpathians, on the shores of Lake Solina, where he lives a simple, rustic life. Krzysztof, at 77, is a youngster by comparison. He came to the forest in 1981 to escape political repression and never left. He believes his life in the countryside is the key to happiness.","popularity":0.294,"poster_path":"/xXdpThzesgXuuKRyiEoaHbLM5SC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":588,"logo_path":"/6mWg9rdVSj8gwgMiOmZH4iBCcMm.png","name":"MDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Vagabonds of the Carpathians","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Les Carpates : Le Royaume des vieux vagabonds","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3619545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darek","original_name":"Darek","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62cb8bc24a4bfc0055ec41b2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3619546,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juliusz","original_name":"Juliusz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62cb8bcd90b87e075864b71a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3619547,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Krzysztof Pross","original_name":"Krzysztof Pross","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62cb8be14b9bae0a527200b3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3619548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wadeck","original_name":"Wadeck","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62cb8bea498bc21466d37603","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1931427,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vivien Pieper","original_name":"Vivien Pieper","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607ecc76aa659e0078e0b311","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3619552,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sören Schlotfeldt","original_name":"Sören Schlotfeldt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62cb8c5ee8131d0fbad9d351","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3619550,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jurek Swierczynski","original_name":"Jurek Swierczynski","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62cb8c41fd4a96004fba6c9f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1899883,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Frank Seidel","original_name":"Frank Seidel","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62cb8c1390b87e07565ed107","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1931427,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vivien Pieper","original_name":"Vivien Pieper","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b18f1f57530e008dcb4ac8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2129529,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Agata Szymańska","original_name":"Agata Szymańska","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b19129c56d2d00f30f8d4d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14232564","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xXdpThzesgXuuKRyiEoaHbLM5SC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/eGDowwUSyo7mzsur7A08schMFIS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7617,"name":"drop-out"},{"id":262444,"name":"society dropout"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2021-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Arte.tv","release_date":"2022-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
