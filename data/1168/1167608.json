Home to celebrated wineries, world-class art galleries... and one very dog-eared community theater. In a town so full of riches (both artistic and monetary), the Raven Players must, ironically, struggle. It's a struggle for both the attention of their cultured but ever-distracted patrons, and by extension the money (and thus, survival) those patrons bring. For the Raven troupe, making ends meet is a full-time job. And yet they carry on...show after show, and year after year. In that spirit, the Raven mounted their latest production in Spring 2012 with that most beloved of show-biz musicals ('Gypsy', naturally). And this time, our cameras were there, every step of the way. The lights are lowered and the audience is seated. So let's put on a show!","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/yvmhbChjjUwaxGiWocmF227uGFZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":206667,"logo_path":null,"name":"Miehana Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Let's put on a show.","title":"The Raven and the Gypsy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4071910,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Scott Roberts","original_name":"Scott Roberts","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e291d637109700e22a4a64","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4071910,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Scott Roberts","original_name":"Scott Roberts","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e29183076ce843b74d799c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4071910,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Scott Roberts","original_name":"Scott Roberts","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e291bae19de9011d5f0171","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4071910,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Scott Roberts","original_name":"Scott Roberts","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e291e6da9ef200c859aead","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2576476","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yvmhbChjjUwaxGiWocmF227uGFZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
