By now she looks back on more than nine decades of life, an old lady who stoically clings to the self-sufficiency of the house where she was born. The place lacks all comfort, neither electricity nor water supply help with cooking or heating. Nonetheless, Suzanne wants for nothing: When the indoor temperature drops to single digits in winter, she simply takes a hot-water bottle to bed and adds another layer of blankets. In the bathroom, water reliably flows from a groove, and if the light hits the surrounding glass carafes, it soon dances through the room.","popularity":0.0674,"poster_path":"/uJaFzTqAxo11NczjjUzEh0695Qd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122175,"logo_path":null,"name":"Région Grand Est","origin_country":""},{"id":11244,"logo_path":"/gCHH1xt3dKjlm9NuMPF9ekpPWD6.png","name":"France 3","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Suzanne from Day to Day","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Suzanne from Day to Day","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2294902,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stéphane Manchematin","original_name":"Stéphane Manchematin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e0f4515ab81a01391a9222","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1901631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serge Steyer","original_name":"Serge Steyer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e0f465aaec7103f9981668","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/uJaFzTqAxo11NczjjUzEh0695Qd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":724},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1244,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/nuMUHFUpT5pBOKSV9zxYrs2ubq8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":933}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"TP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
