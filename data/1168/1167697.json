At hallway intersections and bleacher exits work the second cousins of the carnival barker, the crowd pleasers and teasers, jugglers of people, product and pitch: the point-of-sales professionals known as pitchmen. This documentary looks at the psychology of the impulse sale and provides a view of the world of commerce, salesmanship and advertising at the grass-roots level. The men and women featured in the film have mastered the fine art of selling everything you never needed. Shot at fairs and on the set of a late-night TV commercial, the film shows the hard work behind the hustle.","popularity":0.1547,"poster_path":"/pw1IvqcaMaSnBCSGRnJ3Da6U2W9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1985-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pitchmen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4225684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Telling","original_name":"Charles Telling","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self - Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"64e2df517ef3810121bb38f3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2785291,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ian Hendry","original_name":"Ian Hendry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e2e00465e0a200ad07a742","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1413945,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Andy McBrearty","original_name":"Andy McBrearty","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e2e017076ce843b6533c35","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1414450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barry Greenwald","original_name":"Barry Greenwald","popularity":0.119,"profile_path":"/kysgifljM4HEC1amHxRuokgYKyY.jpg","credit_id":"64e2ddd2e19de900adfdbe7e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1233081,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Steve Lucas","original_name":"Steve Lucas","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e2df26da9ef248f364e4ff","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1414450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barry Greenwald","original_name":"Barry Greenwald","popularity":0.119,"profile_path":"/kysgifljM4HEC1amHxRuokgYKyY.jpg","credit_id":"64e2dfc237109700ac45fca0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1445980,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Robin Leigh","original_name":"Robin Leigh","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e2dfd6cede6900c7eeeabf","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1034809,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Spotton","original_name":"John Spotton","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e2de366728a800ca15a2ee","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7413,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mark Irwin","original_name":"Mark Irwin","popularity":0.1293,"profile_path":"/hHz6PdkfUT9peeTJeNL9LtG1sZi.jpg","credit_id":"64e2df14371097013949a214","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4583,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Niv Fichman","original_name":"Niv Fichman","popularity":0.3262,"profile_path":"/oDetf7f01a6yWVGO4JN2LM32FGV.jpg","credit_id":"64e2dfb6b77d4b113fc7a733","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1198439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Kramer","original_name":"John Kramer","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67783ad8321a3a166a74a636","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1552343,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tom Mather","original_name":"Tom Mather","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67abf90309b8551a04b0bec6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0212428","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6eJkwnqO0WQiEolay2MZKj2Zh1Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pw1IvqcaMaSnBCSGRnJ3Da6U2W9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ontario Science Centre, Toronto","release_date":"1985-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"National Film Board Theatre, Montreal","release_date":"1985-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"CBC","release_date":"1985-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
