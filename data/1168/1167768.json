The specially composed music builds the dramaturgy of the film on equal rights with the image.  This “cinematographic sonata” explores the boundaries of documentary and operates with details, shadows and mystery. The film gets inside the art process of Johanna Forsberg, who lives in the north of Sweden. From the raw metal mesh, cold and resistant, through the fragile moment of creation, to the darkness of the workshop – where everything is possible and the creations have their own life and souls.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/1ZLbxxhjcIXZklg6kU58Vojbolm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2022-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A soul born from the chaos and metal mesh","title":"Soul Cage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4228256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johanna Forsberg","original_name":"Johanna Forsberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"self","credit_id":"64e48dbce0ca7f011ddb9183","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4228265,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marta Zalewska","original_name":"Marta Zalewska","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e48f065258ae00eaa23153","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2386202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Svitlana Topor","original_name":"Svitlana Topor","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e48e0fc613ce00ac3fdcbf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1831043,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Magda Kowalczyk","original_name":"Magda Kowalczyk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e48e221feac10138d85f6b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4228258,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tomasz Waldowski","original_name":"Tomasz Waldowski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e48e3de0ca7f00c6656360","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4353198,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Vladimir Tarasiuk","original_name":"Vladimir Tarasiuk","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e5c0e73768a73f8d90f774","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1ZLbxxhjcIXZklg6kU58Vojbolm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
