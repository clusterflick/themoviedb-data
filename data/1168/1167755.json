He explores his youth growing up in Dunoon, his training to be a priest, and how he made the jump from working in the city of London to a life of performance. There are the adventures in the Ken Campbell Roadshow, his journeys around the world, and – of course – his life as the universe’s most famous Time Lord in Doctor Who, and his time in Middle Earth across The Hobbit movies. Sylvester also candidly tells the story of losing his father just before he was born, his mother’s mental health battles, and growing up with family members in the absence of his parents.","popularity":0.3364,"poster_path":"/d7LBPmTkd6SG7RRaXqYGX8rubij.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":206688,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Stories","origin_country":""},{"id":206689,"logo_path":"/tSXDaoCpXsrLYvudTChZ0m7YDSh.png","name":"Whynow","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"He'd like to tell you his story.","title":"Sylvester: Who's the Real McCoy?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80112,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvester McCoy","original_name":"Sylvester McCoy","popularity":0.7822,"profile_path":"/y7spOkUTzwf7WYgeGeNMnvBjStd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64e3111cb77d4b11434a063d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80112,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvester McCoy","original_name":"Sylvester McCoy","popularity":0.7822,"profile_path":"/y7spOkUTzwf7WYgeGeNMnvBjStd.jpg","credit_id":"64e3120a65e0a200ffbde9ef","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4225921,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Clare Eden","original_name":"Clare Eden","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e31223076ce843ba7388a7","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4225920,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Brew","original_name":"Simon Brew","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e311ef544c410138b42f52","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4225920,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Brew","original_name":"Simon Brew","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e311fb6728a801017c5c5f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7ZZdfWjuLTqBGlKV6t5McgoYK45.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":1487,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/d7LBPmTkd6SG7RRaXqYGX8rubij.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":1487,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p69uWPpWzPB0OAmjidp8hs0abBj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
