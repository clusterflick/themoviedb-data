Traffic Consultants proposed an elevated highway for Cork city, with over 90 acres of demolition estimated for parking clearances in the central island area. The Â£16.5m construction, which was due to stretch from the Port to the Courthouse, Patrick's Hill to Barrack Street, would have seen the city surrender to the motorcar. Michelle Delea's film interviews former architects of 'The City Seventy Planning Group', which emerged from the pioneering class of the Crawford School of Architecture. This group, supported by journalist Mary Leland, successfully campaigned against the B.K.S. Traffic Plan, preserving the character of the city as we know it today.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/haXBxdWl74SieQOcfNmBRDIYHbw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sprawling Octopus of an Elevated Highway","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4223637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Leland","original_name":"Mary Leland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"64e11d912495ab00e37c302a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4223638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerard O'Callaghan","original_name":"Gerard O'Callaghan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"64e11da0076ce8011d1578b8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4223639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Wallace","original_name":"Harry Wallace","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"64e11db4b77d4b113e077d84","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4223640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerald McCarthy","original_name":"Gerald McCarthy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"64e11dc22495ab011dd447bc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4223641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Santry","original_name":"John Santry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"64e11dcde19de9013a28890c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4223642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Des Heffernan","original_name":"Des Heffernan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"64e11dd82495ab00c68be087","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4223643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Heffernan","original_name":"John Heffernan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"64e11de6076ce8013a29db94","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4223644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Hegarty","original_name":"Neil Hegarty","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"64e11df2e19de90100e8f5b5","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4223646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dr. Michael Waldron","original_name":"Dr. Michael Waldron","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"64e11e0237109700c51f0cca","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4223635,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Patrick Creedon","original_name":"Patrick Creedon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e11d5c076ce8013a29db6b","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4223634,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michelle Delea","original_name":"Michelle Delea","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e11d4c37109700e229cbfa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4223636,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dr. Sarah Mulrooney","original_name":"Dr. Sarah Mulrooney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e11d6ea3b5e601d59e91ed","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/haXBxdWl74SieQOcfNmBRDIYHbw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
