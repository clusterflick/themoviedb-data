This village located several kilometers from the school will not allow the children to go to class on time and to follow the lessons in the same way as the other students. In this atmosphere of daily misery, the corrupt power pays very little attention to the problems of grassroots populations and community social services are almost absent. Because of a cursed sum demanded from school by the teacher, the young girl can no longer go to school. On the other side nothing was possible to save their eldest daughter beaten to death by her husband, because they don't have enough to pay for the doctor's prescription. With sincerity and directness, this portrait of a needy family criticizes all the consequences of a badly managed country.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NE","name":"Niger"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vendredi noir","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4224162,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maïmouna Issa","original_name":"Maïmouna Issa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64e18215b77d4b11401b25fa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4224165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chef Koutoucouli","original_name":"Chef Koutoucouli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64e18220aaec7103f7e4408f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4224166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alassane Maiga","original_name":"Alassane Maiga","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"64e1822ab77d4b113fc72a6f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4224167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Biba Moussa","original_name":"Biba Moussa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"64e18233076ce800adcebef0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4224169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boubacar Saley","original_name":"Boubacar Saley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"64e1823a5ab81a00c5b7c7ad","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1289289,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fanta Régina Nacro","original_name":"Fanta Régina Nacro","popularity":0.078,"profile_path":"/cQXpgPJd5SIhxawnDBhr8I7Cx4F.jpg","credit_id":"64e181fda3b5e601da48fd67","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4224155,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Djingarey Abdoulaye Maïga","original_name":"Djingarey Abdoulaye Maïga","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e181d6a3b5e601da48fd52","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4224155,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Djingarey Abdoulaye Maïga","original_name":"Djingarey Abdoulaye Maïga","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e1820c37109700ffba89a4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4224155,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Djingarey Abdoulaye Maïga","original_name":"Djingarey Abdoulaye Maïga","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e181a94a52f800c7a33bf7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27695593","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
