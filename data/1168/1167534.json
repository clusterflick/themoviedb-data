When Joel Creech, a half-witted stable hand, is discharged, he becomes a tool of the Cordtses--who also have entered a horse (Buckles) in the race--in drugging Sage King. Lin and Lucy enter Wildfire under the Bostil colors, and she rides him to victory, When Cordts is disgraced and discovered to be a horse thief, he persuades Joel to abduct Lucy. Joel does so, but first he kills Cordts. Warned by his dog of Lucy's danger, Lin pursues and rescues the girl.","popularity":0.0848,"poster_path":"/6UVhBjU5POpwvAXTu08Z1So6AAj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86408,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goldwyn Distributing Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1922-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Romance Rides","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Adams","original_name":"Claire Adams","popularity":0.1144,"profile_path":"/2My48FqA4jYmwBjA6gsNbIF9rkV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lucy Bostil","credit_id":"64e2a95d8c0a480100cf5c2a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2102343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Gantvoort","original_name":"Carl Gantvoort","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Lin Slone","credit_id":"64e2a96a7ef38100ca0c46ac","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Hersholt","original_name":"Jean Hersholt","popularity":0.2104,"profile_path":"/aQ7HTIXEmlnwghYvWk5NS8NBI5M.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Joel Creech","credit_id":"64e2a973076ce843ba734939","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry von Meter","original_name":"Harry von Meter","popularity":0.2045,"profile_path":"/memFnJZxuWx0PYxibqi5JyBhKZV.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Bill Cordts","credit_id":"64e2a98294631800c80911de","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Arling","original_name":"Charles Arling","popularity":0.1275,"profile_path":"/p45sSO9rmlCtsjoRjMQcTlAIMef.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bostil","credit_id":"64e2a992b77d4b114260c5bd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2584156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tod Sloan","original_name":"Tod Sloan","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Holley","credit_id":"64e2a99e7ef3810121bb12fb","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Hayes","original_name":"Frank Hayes","popularity":0.0567,"profile_path":"/uNwFqMvzSRS7peGdVP8XoWV62iD.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dr. Binks","credit_id":"64e2a9ae076ce843b5b8b4e1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":932459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Jane Irving","original_name":"Mary Jane Irving","popularity":0.1829,"profile_path":"/g3YthHA4ryVzo5tu67STq3UMkyV.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"\"Bostie\" Bostil","credit_id":"64e2a9e3076ce843b74d80c9","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1380493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"S.J.
