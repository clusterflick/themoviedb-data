It also commemorates the secret location, in nearby Church House, where MPs met following the destruction of the Commons chamber. The film features Sir Winston Churchill giving a lighthearted commemorative speech to mark the occasion of the reopening of the restored House of Commons. There is also rare footage of King George VI delivering an address to both House of Parliament in Westminster Hall - the only monarch to have done so since Charles I. Many of the skills employed to restore the chamber to its original condition are also featured in sequences showing the craftsmen at work.","popularity":0.2021,"poster_path":"/gIsqmKGV5Ojf3GHwsnHKTtByObG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1950-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Debate Continues","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Winston Churchill","original_name":"Winston Churchill","popularity":0.3296,"profile_path":"/tpxNemRAcaRckG7kkPk5oRwKTim.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64e25f691d1bf401011929cf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"King George VI of the United Kingdom","original_name":"King George VI of the United Kingdom","popularity":0.1663,"profile_path":"/pui6dR4cf5TACDbN1PWInEdpYo2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64e25f76076ce843b5b8a2fb","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iHW6qc6WqyvqYeCgBOFe2vNHvki.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gIsqmKGV5Ojf3GHwsnHKTtByObG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1950-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
