Established in 1960 and a landmark on the Blues Trail, his shop was the hang-out for great Hill Country Blues artists like Junior Kimbrough and R.L. Burnside — earning a place in blues magazines all over the world. Amidst waves of change and pressure from other business owners in town to close up shop, Mr. Caldwell, lovingly dubbed the “Father of the Alley,” keeps the dream alive, against all odds. Featuring music by William Tyler, R.L. Burnside, Junior Kimbrough, Precious Bryant, Little Joe Ayers, and more.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/3G3wvyv6xfUDE1YccUQm5XbxvMq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Please Ask For It","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4226765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David “Fox” Caldwell","original_name":"David “Fox” Caldwell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64e37c3d371097011c553d06","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4226767,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allison Waid","original_name":"Allison Waid","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e37c6265e0a200ad07f897","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4226768,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Sutton","original_name":"Stephen Sutton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e37c8737109700ac46476e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4226779,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tim Duggan","original_name":"Tim Duggan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e37d3065e0a2011cb100c4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4226782,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jocelyn Brown","original_name":"Jocelyn Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e37d5b37109700ffbb6e75","department":"Sound","job":"Music Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3064991,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kira Simon-Kennedy","original_name":"Kira Simon-Kennedy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e381c2b77d4b113fc7eefd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4226767,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allison Waid","original_name":"Allison Waid","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e381d065e0a2011cb10256","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28664008","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3G3wvyv6xfUDE1YccUQm5XbxvMq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1501},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2454,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cyNTtCCHnT7gYn1LkeOsg8pBNau.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1638}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
