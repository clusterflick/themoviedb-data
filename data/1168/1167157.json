Featuring stunning aerial photography, this fascinating documentary gives us a unique vantage point to understand how this family imposed itself onto the very fabric of the land with battlefields, ruined monasteries, powerful castles and the beautiful symmetry of the era’s grand houses and palaces. Swooping above the landscapes and buildings behind some of Britain’s best-known events – places where Sir Francis Drake, Henry VIII, Shakespeare and Elizabeth I once walked – this beautifully shot programme explores history from a whole new angle.","popularity":1.6847,"poster_path":"/ifl8wMOD1H997mZmrb8hr5TBwip.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7521,"logo_path":"/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png","name":"National Geographic","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tudors From Above","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1270230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Tilling","original_name":"Roger Tilling","popularity":0.0465,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"64e12e55aaec7103fa48b37f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1656518,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Mervyn","original_name":"Richard Mervyn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e12e6ce19de9013a288d01","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1656518,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Mervyn","original_name":"Richard Mervyn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e12e852495ab0100855578","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1656518,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Mervyn","original_name":"Richard Mervyn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e12e8e5ab81a00ffc27757","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4223776,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Josh Haul","original_name":"Josh Haul","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e12eb2a3b5e601d63aad35","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3292192,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Annabel maidment","original_name":"Annabel maidment","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e12ed8e19de900e34382cd","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1408523,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joy Galane","original_name":"Joy Galane","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e12ea1076ce800adce9f1c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oZxCx27GQKdN9OzS1DdwfCa6aef.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ifl8wMOD1H997mZmrb8hr5TBwip.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3098,"name":"castle"},{"id":7537,"name":"tudor"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
