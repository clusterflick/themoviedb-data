During a party, they recognize their feelings for one another. The two start dating, although they hide their relationship from family and friends as they move in together. Ryo and Kaoru are struggling actors. They fail to land roles after auditioning many times. Feeling discouraged, Ryo decides to switch careers and settle for a stable office job. The busy work schedule means he spends less time with his boyfriend. Tensions arise when Kaoru doesn't contribute to the household chores, and they become increasingly dissatisfied with each other. Another source of conflict is that Ryo hasn't come out to his family. He doesn't want them to know about their same-sex relationship. The lack of recognition bothers Kaoru. As the couple approaches their second anniversary, they reassess their love and must decide whether to continue dating.","popularity":0.0848,"poster_path":"/bF26YKALeuJK9MmFSB43WXSu6Rx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2023-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Polyethylene Terephthalate","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4226744,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hinata Asai","original_name":"Hinata Asai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64e3776d371097013949ed2d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4226745,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryu Shigeoka","original_name":"Ryu Shigeoka","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64e37776076ce843b653881f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4226747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sana Kobayashi","original_name":"Sana Kobayashi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64e3779e37109700ffbb6c5f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4226749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuma Kawano","original_name":"Yuma Kawano","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64e377ac076ce843b5b926f1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4226751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuki Maebashi","original_name":"Yuki Maebashi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64e377b8d75bd6011c134890","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4226744,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hinata Asai","original_name":"Hinata Asai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e3774b65e0a200c5eeb5e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5RcZvao2XBMe6soTQllXEdo4pq9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lXq6fQX5dx2BakNLBW60r0moNRl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/bF26YKALeuJK9MmFSB43WXSu6Rx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
