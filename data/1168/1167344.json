How does matter become alive? David Deutsch, in chapter eight of his book \\\"The Fabric of Reality,\\\" delves into the essence of life's phenomenon. Drawing on seminal works like Richard Dawkins' \\\"The Selfish Gene\\\" and \\\"The Extended Phenotype\\\", Deutsch deepens our understanding of Darwin's theory of evolution. He also elucidates one of the universe's major mysteries: what distinguishes living matter from non-living matter. Moreover, he sheds light on why life is one of nature's fundamental phenomena. This video serves as an adaptation of that chapter.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Boundary Of Life - How does non-living matter become living matter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
