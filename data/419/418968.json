Presented in double-projection, with images from two separate rolls overlaid to form a single image, this film focuses on an obscure figure finding himself in a forest path, caught between perpetual motion and stasis. The painterly images fluctuate in the complex shifting of color and texture, phasing in and out through a polymetric structure. It is a perceptual journey without destination in the turning sphere of ever-changing image and sound, whose beginning and end move in parallel towards a fleeting point of convergence. The palindrome of the title alludes to the structure of the film based on various combinations of a series of recurring sequences that move forward and in reverse simultaneously, defying the usual sense of progression. With original sound composition by Malcolm Goldstein.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/lc9pU1h7ZMvHdYQzTdJw9qTNdnP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"14","title":"Never a Foot Too Far, Even","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087712,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Da誰chi Sa誰to","original_name":"Da誰chi Sa誰to","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/fGOrpxizCO75sXR6ylstm9IQzjs.jpg","credit_id":"57f03dc4c3a3683f27006e9b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5621418","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lc9pU1h7ZMvHdYQzTdJw9qTNdnP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":852},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lrBi2YOV4n7gqg9jM3nU8yVk8UW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iMj2LLajxMSV5ZUga3EbGzuBzpg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":1552,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uxvmYVuUsYIm0wBWqp86siNpaSp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
