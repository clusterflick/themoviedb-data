These elements and more emerge and re-emerge like musical motifs, continuously and meticulously altered through processes like bleaching, staining, and multiple print generation, dramatically extracting the formal particularities of the Kodachrome reversal print.","popularity":0.0787,"poster_path":"/k4r9Ob8HLdiGbhDgRPcO8ffSK9s.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Heart","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1507831,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Barnett","original_name":"Dan Barnett","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57f03d629251415925006cba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1734138","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pGrHv4gx8eEZDv9wKwfFc8DkSDa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/k4r9Ob8HLdiGbhDgRPcO8ffSK9s.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hjIJhlHi0LhyJjvvBPj2XxkVhr7.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/63mYYq0jHPLU0wSOT0NHy6PdkSW.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
