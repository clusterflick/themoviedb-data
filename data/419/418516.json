First, the scientists predict the storm's course, giving several days' warning to farmers and growers. The growers, typified by the Morgan family, prepare the oil-burning pots throughout their grove. Then, as the temperature dips below freezing, they light the pots. The cold snap continues as oil-supplies dwindle; the smoky air slows traffic, including trucks bringing more oil. The scientists strive to predict how long freezing temperatures will last: can the Morgans hold out?","popularity":0.2794,"poster_path":"/8RSgy2eo7cy5XC43w4MLVTlgKwb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1939-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Weather Wizards","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1147060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pete Smith","original_name":"Pete Smith","popularity":0.2487,"profile_path":"/gVw7tr02hGeUxfzQKNAZTCtHPFh.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"57ec0cec9251410c5b007be4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":265594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Dilson","original_name":"John Dilson","popularity":0.1297,"profile_path":"/xlskbrwdPKvGtq9uYHvdUhuy8UE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"California Meteorologist","credit_id":"57ec0cfa92514151df0000de","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122984,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bert Moorhouse","original_name":"Bert Moorhouse","popularity":0.1544,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Weather Balloon Launcher","credit_id":"57ec0d09925141520e0000d4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1091307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alonzo Price","original_name":"Alonzo Price","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Mr. Morgan","credit_id":"57ec0d16c3a3685e860000c3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":967133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Robinson","original_name":"Ruth Robinson","popularity":0.0626,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mrs. Morgan","credit_id":"57ec0d23c3a3683a70000ce2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Stanton","original_name":"Will Stanton","popularity":0.1512,"profile_path":"/1BbhkRE5sGBnKF8KB1d4UWYNkaf.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Uncle Jim","credit_id":"57ec0d41925141519d00010b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":978032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Winkler","original_name":"Robert Winkler","popularity":0.1626,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Morgan's Son","credit_id":"57ec0d50c3a3685e3600010b","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30101,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert Lees","original_name":"Robert Lees","popularity":0.1063,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57ec0d7d925141522d0000da","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30102,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frederic I.
