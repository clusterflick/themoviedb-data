The results range from the romantic  (Hudson River School painter Frederic Church's Olana, framing  views of the Catskills to echo his paintings), to the futuristic  (Urbanist Paolo Soleri's silt-casted structure Cosanti growing out  of experiments in bell making in the Arizona desert). Commentary  from cultural critic Alastair Gordon and an original score by Jamie  Rudolph help to evoke the spiritual dimension of the locations  and argue the case that the intuitive vision of artists can create  great architecture.","popularity":0.0892,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Art House","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2050120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eliphante","original_name":"Eliphante","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5b0741bc9251417d120020ec","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2050121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Nakashim","original_name":"George Nakashim","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5b0741e8c3a3687d67000f6d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2050122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Chapman Mercer","original_name":"Henry Chapman Mercer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5b074202c3a3687d70000ca6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2050123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wharton Esherick","original_name":"Wharton Esherick","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5b0742139251417d0c001517","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2050124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paolo Soleri","original_name":"Paolo Soleri","popularity":0.0869,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5b0742269251417d0c001525","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2050125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederic Church","original_name":"Frederic Church","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5b07423c0e0a263c3400154d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2050126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raoul Hague","original_name":"Raoul Hague","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5b0742490e0a263c240015cb","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2050127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Varnum Poor","original_name":"Henry Varnum Poor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5b07425b9251417d37001267","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2050128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alastair Gordon","original_name":"Alastair Gordon","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5b074265c3a3687d52001d57","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2050129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russel Wright","original_name":"Russel Wright","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5b07426c9251417d2f0016d7","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2050119,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Don Freeman","original_name":"Don Freeman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0741a20e0a263c21001840","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2803314","wikidata_id":"Q27041773","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
