Having developed many unique techniques, Eddie personally takes you through his exciting grappling career from a blue belt all the way to his win over Royler Gracie at Abu Dhabi 2003.  See Eddie pull off 8 twisters, 2 rear naked chokes, 2 calf cranks, 1 arm bar, 1 triangle, 2 decisions, and 1 loss. Most won’t put their losses on their own DVD but this is Eddie’s favorite.  Plenty of extras are on this disc including a tour through his “crib”, and 5 hidden easter eggs (2 instructionals, 2 insane comedy sketches) and 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu highlights.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Twister","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
