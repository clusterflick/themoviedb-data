After having cried and prayed on a cross, the grass-widow returns to the farm to resume her duties and takes a sack of wheat to the next mill. The miller, knowing of the sailor's departure, and finding the lass very agreeable and charming, after having seen to the wheat bag, gives his whole attention to the young woman, and he does not seem to mind very much the clumsy advances made by the workingman. They part after a rather excited confab, and have evidently made an appointment for the evening at the church, for it is a Christmas celebration. We follow the two young people in the chapel, then to a bonfire dance, and lastly we see them both driving away in a country cart.","popularity":0.0812,"poster_path":"/rrQye9S1KL7qfIt7JwkqBQHipZ4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1908-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Christmas Eve Tragedy","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Christmas Eve Night","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1666049","wikidata_id":"Q104467866","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rrQye9S1KL7qfIt7JwkqBQHipZ4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1908-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Nuit de Noël (1908) Christmas Eve Tragedy (Pathé)","key":"wY56faKnyyw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-10-16T20:54:50.000Z","id":"673174f03bc71ca8909f22a3"}]}}}
