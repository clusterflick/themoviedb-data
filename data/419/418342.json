From 1526 to 1858, this dynasty of nomadic warriors indulged their appetite for territorial expansion, spreading their rule throughout the Indian subcontinent. Though they conquered their kingdom with crushing brutality, the Mughals were also brilliant technological innovators and masters of art and architecture. This program offers lush, detailed images of Mughal accomplishments such as the glorious Taj Mahal, palaces, forts, water systems, elaborate gardens, and richly crafted artwork. Step-by-step scientific recreations of advanced Mughal metallurgy and weaponry show the meticulous production of chain mail armor for a battalion of elephants, lethally flexible composite bows, rocketry, and swordsmith techniques passed down through the generations, and still alive today.","popularity":0.4657,"poster_path":"/AmnCrIkfEScUJU1Ft6UHAiTbATj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3507,"logo_path":"/m7iLIC5UfC2Pp60bkjXMWLFrmp6.png","name":"History","origin_country":"US"},{"id":22304,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yap Films","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2006-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Warrior Empire: The Mughals of India","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom McCamus","original_name":"Tom McCamus","popularity":0.3873,"profile_path":"/t9OjLyV9i0LilORn3kBp1YXwMYD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6754ad60a7b2fcb11e524b9e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1244073,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sally Aitken","original_name":"Sally Aitken","popularity":0.0586,"profile_path":"/2GlQoCAixuvUOyiFal8jnHvC735.jpg","credit_id":"6754ad4a6f37f6e89adc3fa4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1209370","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8sVjdVDypGOXbq7F8WVilwfjpJp.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2505,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/AmnCrIkfEScUJU1Ft6UHAiTbATj.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1670},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h9JjU1XITUkR6RwwZefrFmjaXVe.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7SM24q2Ls32VBP0dXDHkuE9sfJ8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":292592,"name":"indian history"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2006-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
