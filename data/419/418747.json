Degraded to a henchman he grimly struggles to get back on the job market. He fights to climb the social ladder. In the process he realizes that there are other values than income and success.

But they celebrate a small triumph against the dominance of the ruling system.","popularity":0.4663,"poster_path":"/2B8X43oYaVpnBwDfNSBvmDF7e9b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81956,"logo_path":"/j1gYelmPIye4HKBR47CiQ87TaqB.png","name":"FreibeuterFilm","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":28950,"logo_path":"/8RuUUKhPiJbICV03XO79IhSh8CH.png","name":"Dschoint
