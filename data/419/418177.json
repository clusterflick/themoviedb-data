In a dialogue between generations, young people are responsible for elaborating the question, and School is the place that tries to come up with a technique for it. In turn, the elderly answer through their stories, which are basically the story of the town. And like the word –which is always a fiction– builds a reality, the film sustains its tone on that intermediate area in which a fictional setting provides the conditions for the pure documentary genre to mark the pace and reach out to people.","popularity":0.1052,"poster_path":"/rDoSW9HnBm5bCaipXT6xnbTWfVi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135874,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vientosur Cine","origin_country":""},{"id":19196,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blackmaria","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2016-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Streets","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1438612,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Bianco","original_name":"Eva Bianco","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/d6ewiyd0xpbAcvH1LOEmqIGH0BE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"587e9a3cc3a36847e802b37f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":914866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mara Santucho","original_name":"Mara Santucho","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/eHFuFe8zIVWww51DaRC9ONaJxeE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"587e9a459251413f1b02b1a3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1364128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriel Pérez","original_name":"Gabriel Pérez","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5eea9f6481da3900334da44d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2584300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Osvaldo Bayer","original_name":"Osvaldo Bayer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5eea9f72fdc1460034e6055c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2682437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luna Barone","original_name":"Luna Barone","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5eea9f80fdc1460036e72aa6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2682439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maximiliano Buss","original_name":"Maximiliano Buss","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5eea9f87dd926a0034a17d23","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2682440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renzo Fernández","original_name":"Renzo Fernández","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5eea9f8e9661fc00355ac07c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2682441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisa Eraso","original_name":"Elisa Eraso","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5eea9f969661fc00385b7e39","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1685244,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"María Aparicio","original_name":"María Aparicio","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":"/82fsefEB7SnNKlFzFUL2bDl0zHH.jpg","credit_id":"57e9400592514168f5003e31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1811970,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolás Abello","original_name":"Nicolás Abello","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eea9f2e81da3900364dae84","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1685244,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"María Aparicio","original_name":"María Aparicio","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":"/82fsefEB7SnNKlFzFUL2bDl0zHH.jpg","credit_id":"5eea9f3f6dea3a0032bc472e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5644216","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.722,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rDoSW9HnBm5bCaipXT6xnbTWfVi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":693}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
