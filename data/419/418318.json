The image-capturing process produces a sedimented landscape that gradually unfolds while simultaneously disintegrating under temporal displacement. Approximately 30 long takes begin at the same frame on the film strip, all shot at a high frame rate. My walking rhythm varies for each trajectory, resulting in the space progressively expanding in depth until I reach the edge of a dock. The duration of the long take corresponds to the length of the celluloid reel, a thousand feet of 35mm film.”—Alexandre Larose","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/hYTHwYwUXsvUQD17PNjyWJLkQf0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brouillard #15","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1364064,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandre Larose","original_name":"Alexandre Larose","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":"/9LxhUOjLRPrtnAchEfHJx1NIFAX.jpg","credit_id":"57ea7401c3a368780c0002fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hYTHwYwUXsvUQD17PNjyWJLkQf0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1548,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/czt9QmECfuurVKrNPyGBs1pGONR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
