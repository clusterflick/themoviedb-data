The tangled legacy of European colonialism in Africa is evoked through images of women practicing hair braiding on discarded white baby dolls from the West. The film unfolds through a series of vignettes, set against a child's story of migrating from Ghana to the United States. The film uncovers the meaning behind the Akan term of endearment, me broni ba, which means “my white baby.”","popularity":0.6172,"poster_path":"/s4YcBEmDl3K6kkkq3G0mPTpqhFj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53633,"logo_path":null,"name":"Obibini
