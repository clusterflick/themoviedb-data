He is a witness to their marriage and after the ceremony he departs heartbroken to his own house. Utopian was the existence of Lionel and Camilla, until some time later Camilla is seized with a serious illness, and Lionel's grief knew no bounds when he heard \"That low knell tolling his lady dead.\" \"She had lain three days without a pulse all that look'd on her had pronounced her dead, So they bore her, for in Julian's land they never nail a dumb head up in elm, bore her free-faced to the free airs of heaven, and laid her in the vault of her own kin.\" Julian learns of the death of Camilla, and hastens to the house, arriving in time to see the funeral cort√®ge moving slowly towards the sepulcher. Following in its wake he exclaims, \"Now, now, will 1 go down into the grave; I will be all alone with all I love.\"","popularity":0.375,"poster_path":"/usGbDTLxAPHU4Ub2PlwUtBxNt2j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1910-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Golden Supper","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1129188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy West","original_name":"Dorothy West","popularity":0.0664,"profile_path":"/h3m5mKBVYGRLpVvX0CE2vUTxs8D.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Camilla","credit_id":"57e90ee3c3a368475d0129f5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1091997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edwin August","original_name":"Edwin August","popularity":0.1212,"profile_path":"/cpnHZ8of3zIXpsGG6jsLl7dCZ8s.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Prince Julian","credit_id":"57e90ef4c3a36835a201b5c2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1119769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles West","original_name":"Charles West","popularity":0.1267,"profile_path":"/b83aIQMnrWmXxnYm5vbPI1izN7u.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lionel - Julian's Rival","credit_id":"57e90f07925141298701cfe6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire McDowell","original_name":"Claire McDowell","popularity":0.4763,"profile_path":"/lITEhC4pY2UiqmItzQMBnexxcMU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lady-in-Waiting","credit_id":"57e90f19925141395b01ae17","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1016129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Henderson","original_name":"Grace Henderson","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":"/h9DRMmxkbujKEBV4wKyS7hF5nqm.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Queen","credit_id":"57e90f3292514168e9001ef1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Crisp","original_name":"Donald Crisp","popularity":0.2368,"profile_path":"/MEPq09iLEwJVrxw1T97qOILhk6.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Courtier/Monk","credit_id":"60426a0a9a358d006e68a820","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":103924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Davenport","original_name":"Dorothy Davenport","popularity":0.1278,"profile_path":"/mS2sibbJ4046yDGmocE43LRWeil.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Flower Girl","credit_id":"60426a133429ff0028908091","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis J.
