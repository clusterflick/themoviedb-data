Their mother left for Yeonbyeon three months ago, promising to return with their father, and they have heard no news from her since. Every day, Myung-hee and Myung-ho go to the shipping port or airport hoping for their parents' return. Tired from waiting one day, Myung-hee meets Yong-kyu, a young man high from sniffing glue. Beyond a tough and violent exterior, Myung-hee finds a young man's heartwarming inner-self, and she expects Yong-kyu to take the place of her parents. But even Yong-kyu leaves her and life steadily deteriorates. Hoping for help, Myung-hee goes to a familiar Korean-Chinese woman, arriving in time to find immigration officials taking the woman away. They are now truly alone.","popularity":0.2569,"poster_path":"/pgQK2fwUWgVsuG9HdgiuACRUuwr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74216,"logo_path":"/gNBRUzI4CI9cKfNDsR9KOdlkEj6.png","name":"Busan Film Commission","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2013-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Farewell","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1559863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joo Ah-reum","original_name":"주아름","popularity":0.3597,"profile_path":"/tX9hQCRq6EBF7wGYEwqxsX61Th3.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Myung-hee","credit_id":"59beea769251414720005c60","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1134769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Ju-seung","original_name":"이주승","popularity":0.5408,"profile_path":"/6yJqT18fiQDEPtMEoU2OWU5x4tG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Yong-kyu","credit_id":"59beeab8c3a3682feb005ddf","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1983030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Baek-jun","original_name":"Kim Baek-jun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a8ee3de9251416c84014756","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1983030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Baek-jun","original_name":"Kim Baek-jun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a8ee3efc3a368266a013f45","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1983030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Baek-jun","original_name":"Kim Baek-jun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a8ee401c3a3682678017c16","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1286,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pgQK2fwUWgVsuG9HdgiuACRUuwr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
