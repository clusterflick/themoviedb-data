He appears to have it all: he has won many awards in his field, has a great wife Iris and a ten year old adopted son Werner. Iris is 39 and a strong partner, professionally and personally. She's beautiful, smart and a workaholic. Freek is known in the advertising world as a charmer and womanizer. He meets a dazzling young woman, the 24-year-old Alberta, whom he falls for. She persuades him to go to the place she shares a name with; Alberta, in the Canadian Rockies. The plan is to escape life in the Netherlands and paint expressionistic landscapes of the Canadian scenery together. Boredom strikes sooner than anticipated and Alberta goes in search of adventure elsewhere, leaving Freek hopeless and alone. Can he handle life on his own?","popularity":0.4655,"poster_path":"/usHC54zHGybVKpIU67XSkuGY4Zi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2016-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alberta","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniël Boissevain","original_name":"Daniël Boissevain","popularity":0.3695,"profile_path":"/goCwSaDIg6gb7IgIiDR2Qr7gNbH.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Freek","credit_id":"57efb1819251415a3b002e5f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1249644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamie Grant","original_name":"Jamie Grant","popularity":0.12,"profile_path":"/b4ZJOTaC42zIWO52JXs3Z1BUmVu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Alberta","credit_id":"57efb197c3a3683f720028d6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1060228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Duijvestein","original_name":"Eva Duijvestein","popularity":0.2456,"profile_path":"/ggBnpbnndbAwvundQEXM6Oh1prc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"echtgenote","credit_id":"57efb20592514158d0002e72","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1905015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chip Bray","original_name":"Chip Bray","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/hXuZlVgCIcT3LdyuukaVeMlmLEj.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bread","credit_id":"60057d4d4ca676003f0a5e73","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2941553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marnie Baumer","original_name":"Marnie Baumer","popularity":0.0804,"profile_path":"/qmJ99Ssz85f5jdJdeUex1SbqHQ2.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mary Jo","credit_id":"60057d69b0040a003e946469","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1917580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cherise Silvestri","original_name":"Cherise Silvestri","popularity":0.1337,"profile_path":"/pXcX1DVppjiQtFMVfEnVHVmOYrX.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Olivia","credit_id":"60057d844ca676003e0ad9f8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2941556,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marvin Wan","original_name":"Marvin Wan","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Werner","credit_id":"60057db3a76ac5003ead6df9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":210972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roelant Radier","original_name":"Roelant Radier","popularity":0.0347,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Ruud","credit_id":"60057dcb420228003df3c391","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1262525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wynn Heliczer","original_name":"Wynn Heliczer","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":"/yXYC2kR3pk0CbvVgQ3qhpEsrY4Z.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"One night Stand","credit_id":"6005835bedeb43003f44403c","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288640,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Roos van Ees","original_name":"Roos van Ees","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/ttrWtccyG72CtDfVp3hm3rXH1FO.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"One night stand","credit_id":"60058599e942ee003ee666f3","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1479474,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Erik Wünsch","original_name":"Erik Wünsch","popularity":0.0693,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57efb24c92514158d0002e88","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":81717,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eddy Terstall","original_name":"Eddy Terstall","popularity":0.1436,"profile_path":"/j08UxS9ijWSeosRoeauGhFYgaRo.jpg","credit_id":"57efb23492514159de002cc0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5088378","wikidata_id":"Q24705788","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1328,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j0zLXpL7CdXvsySv3pVBY0biBlT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2361}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1131,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/usHC54zHGybVKpIU67XSkuGY4Zi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1599,"name":"midlife crisis"},{"id":229686,"name":"overspel"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"wereldpremière op het NFF","release_date":"2016-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
