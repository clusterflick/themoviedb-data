Three people from different cultures and, more importantly, different generations – Eliane, Romes and Pablo – decide to take action in their lives before it’s too late. Recognized for her short films (Le futur proche, La ronde), Sophie Goyette scrupulously chronicles the quest of three protagonists who have reached a turning point in their personal journey. For her first feature, she delivers a meditative work steeped in the universal questions of human nature.","popularity":0.1295,"poster_path":"/dQybVyXJU1vxE1C4pYDiApsPZTb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2016-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Still Night, Still Light","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1841155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Éliane Préfontaine","original_name":"Éliane Préfontaine","popularity":0.0605,"profile_path":"/pKc3s0pkynuj6mQ3Avn3xMUqpeU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Éliane","credit_id":"5b73eed20e0a267ef41cbf96","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1301522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerardo Trejoluna","original_name":"Gerardo Trejoluna","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/fJzcjj3JrARh3iQEx5lMbCEfRKq.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Romes","credit_id":"5b73eef9c3a368189421966c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2113050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Felipe Casanova","original_name":"Felipe Casanova","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Pablo","credit_id":"5b7d88c90e0a263bd30111bc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1304726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rocío Sagaón","original_name":"Rocío Sagaón","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Romes' mother (voice)","credit_id":"5b7e87310e0a2615c9011786","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1196467,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophie Goyette","original_name":"Sophie Goyette","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57eddfcd925141174000181f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1384927,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Léna Mill-Reuillard","original_name":"Léna Mill-Reuillard","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b73ee8a0e0a267ef81d71d3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1196467,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophie Goyette","original_name":"Sophie Goyette","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b73eeb4925141406a1c677f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1196467,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophie Goyette","original_name":"Sophie Goyette","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b73eea0c3a368188f1c9d50","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6281166","wikidata_id":"Q110469417","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dQybVyXJU1vxE1C4pYDiApsPZTb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
