His band singer Marjory Logan and The Tune Twisters (male trio) sing two more Green songs (both with lyrics by James Dyrenforth): \"What Now\" and \"Not Bad.\" Green chastises his second pianist (and arranger), Dave Terry, for infringing on Green's musical territory. With the aid of trick photography, Green, with a wave of his baton, reduces the orchestra to miniature size, then Dave Terry does the same to Green. The film closes with an intricate version of \"Sweet Sue-Just You\"(Victor Young-Will Harris), featuring Green's saxophone section.","popularity":0.1627,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1935-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Melody Magic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":175505,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Johnny Green","original_name":"Johnny Green","popularity":0.1306,"profile_path":"/iJcJ84Z5M3jf0XWN3L5CQmMMMO9.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"57ec0784c3a36836570078e7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1590691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marjory Logan","original_name":"Marjory Logan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself - Singer","credit_id":"57ec0793925141356c000ad1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1686029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Terry","original_name":"Dave Terry","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself - Pianist","credit_id":"57ec07a0c3a36868bd007fc6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1686030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tune Twisters","original_name":"Tune Twisters","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Themselves","credit_id":"57ec07ad9251410de0007ae3","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":175505,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Johnny Green","original_name":"Johnny Green","popularity":0.1306,"profile_path":"/iJcJ84Z5M3jf0XWN3L5CQmMMMO9.jpg","credit_id":"57ec07e8925141188c0018d0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1146991,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred Waller","original_name":"Fred Waller","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/jdtGlSK7jlO5cy6qVkEcq7emaRn.jpg","credit_id":"57ec07bdc3a36813d30016d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1590689,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fred Rath","original_name":"Fred Rath","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57ec07d7c3a3683a04000afd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1590688,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Milton Hockey","original_name":"Milton Hockey","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57ec07c9c3a3683657007903","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109700,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"William O.
