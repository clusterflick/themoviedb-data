All Padstownians participate in the event, which has now become a tourist attraction drawing over tens of thousands of annual visitors. Folklorists Alan Lomax and Peter Kennedy and filmmaker George Pickow collected footage at the festival in 1951, producing a pioneering work in the use of sound, low-light photography, and conversational presentation of narrative. A favorite of Margaret Mead, who used it in her classes, the film circulated widely and continues to have influence today, especially in the neo-Pagan community.","popularity":0.0674,"poster_path":"/ajb5QVhQvyvqnWzMKYbQHbA0LEM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80719,"logo_path":null,"name":"Folk Films","origin_country":""},{"id":80720,"logo_path":null,"name":"English Folk Dance and Song Society","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1953-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oss Oss Wee Oss","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1670402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie Chilton","original_name":"Charlie Chilton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself - Narrator","credit_id":"57bff57f9251414ab80010bf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1670401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie Bate","original_name":"Charlie Bate","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself - Narrator","credit_id":"57bff583c3a36820f80021dd","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545532,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Lomax","original_name":"Alan Lomax","popularity":0.0728,"profile_path":"/cl0OKLtG2KwIPPHwMekmUz88HDy.jpg","credit_id":"55e737a79251416c1b0003ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545532,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Lomax","original_name":"Alan Lomax","popularity":0.0728,"profile_path":"/cl0OKLtG2KwIPPHwMekmUz88HDy.jpg","credit_id":"57bff59b92514128a5001f54","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1670403,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"George Pickow","original_name":"George Pickow","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57bff5b0c3a3684ce70011a8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1974330","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.602,"height":831,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ajb5QVhQvyvqnWzMKYbQHbA0LEM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1953-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Oss Oss Wee Oss!
