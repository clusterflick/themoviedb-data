Their stories represent successes that mainstream medicine and the public ought to know about.  Four of the featured subjects had been diagnosed with cancer; two of these patients were considered terminal cases. The fifth patient had a severe case of Lyme disease. All five have outlived their diseases, between 15 and nearly 40 years, thus far.","popularity":0.7599,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rethinking Cancer","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1504189,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Incao","original_name":"Philip Incao","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"55e713a3c3a3685f9e00329d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1504191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sheryl Leventhal","original_name":"Sheryl Leventhal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"55e713b99251410f07003223","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1504193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rita Znamirowsky","original_name":"Rita Znamirowsky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"55e713cb9251410f04003356","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1987109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Worms","original_name":"Richard Worms","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9644279251417b0900424f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1513878","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3429,"name":"diet"},{"id":10163,"name":"cancer"},{"id":161201,"name":"alternative medicine"},{"id":161217,"name":"pseudoscience"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
