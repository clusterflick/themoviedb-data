In order to develop this impression, in 1998 Hayn began painting watercolors of billboards that had been put up in Berlin. From the outset, each sheet was intended as a \"setting\" of a documentary film that would document the economic, political and interpersonal changes that would become visible in \"public\" images up until 2005.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/jGf6N1EUpdlJzJgTX5yzvh4r1KJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":255620,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stefan Hayn Filmproduktion","origin_country":""},{"id":237290,"logo_path":"/ybY4aLZxf7jcFDizkFTntgTjsQr.png","name":"ZDF/3sat","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":124,"logo_path":"/7MjDMOybX0D3fcIEpCyY9es5XZU.png","name":"SWR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Malerei heute","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1504217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anja-Christin Remmert","original_name":"Anja-Christin Remmert","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55e7315fc3a36837830002d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1447793,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stefan Hayn","original_name":"Stefan Hayn","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55e7317a9251416c1200028d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0757901","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jGf6N1EUpdlJzJgTX5yzvh4r1KJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1413}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Wien, Viennale","release_date":"2005-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Duisburg, Filmwoche","release_date":"2005-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Germany","release_date":"2006-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
