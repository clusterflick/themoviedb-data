Everything, everywhere is the slogan of the nineties, a confusion of bodies, concepts and strategies, a kind of out of joint situation for the subject. And we find ourselves in all the media, in all the bodies in all the possible spaces at ones, but this deadly dance is not innocent. The video consists of the main part in which wives of the so-called totalitarian leaders as of the Rumanian dictator Cauceuscu (Elena) and of the former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic (Mirjana Milosevic) are forced to dance. Focused on the portrait of Mirjana Milosevic (The story of Mirjana M.) a kitsch melodramatic Balkan saga of power, drama, pop-folk elements and evil/demons is constructed. The apathy of feelings is caught in the dramatic tango that is slowed down for the camera eye.","popularity":0.139,"poster_path":"/49BLG8Z9O8IEdncJSCIooBF1RIn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28367,"logo_path":"/kw6n8hNwQXQSPlGdwVZvmbO0Haq.png","name":"RTV Slovenija","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"1995-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A3: Apathy, Aids and Antarctica","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neda Bric","original_name":"Neda Bric","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5c5ffd1d0e0a261deb6bd759","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1714554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niko Goršič","original_name":"Niko Goršič","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5c5ffd540e0a261de56be849","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1811557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Željko Hrš","original_name":"Željko Hrš","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5c5ffd6e9251413381bfe12b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1632928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janja Majzelj","original_name":"Janja Majzelj","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5c5ffd7e925141338cbfd0f8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2027753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matej Recer","original_name":"Matej Recer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5c5ffd93925141721cb7b6b6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1526140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Damjana Černe","original_name":"Damjana Černe","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":"/8vvBhVCNWiWQsnnJBwsVFwcmicK.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5c5ffd9d0e0a261de56be894","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2239146,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Peternelj","original_name":"Ivan Peternelj","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5c5ffdba0e0a2659ab691bc2","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1504535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aina Šmid","original_name":"Aina Šmid","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55e81f3cc3a3682c62001e96","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1504534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marina Gržinić","original_name":"Marina Gržinić","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55e81f32c3a3682c70001d56","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1504535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aina Šmid","original_name":"Aina Šmid","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5ffcc70e0a2624f76b3214","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2238090,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mišo Čadež","original_name":"Mišo Čadež","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5ffcd59251413389bfd156","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1504534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marina Gržinić","original_name":"Marina Gržinić","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5ffcc0c3a3683ccf8f86e4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2014672,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Zlatjan Čučkov","original_name":"Zlatjan Čučkov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5ffce5c3a3683cc68fcaba","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5958770","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/49BLG8Z9O8IEdncJSCIooBF1RIn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
