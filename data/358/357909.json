Texas Bad Man casts Morris as a sheriff who happens to be the son of inveterate thief Frank Ferguson. Knowing full well that Ferguson's gang intends to steal a shipment of gold, Morris must stay up nights trying to second-guess his crafty dad. While there's no shortage of action, the resolution to the story relies more on brawn than brain. Western \"regulars\" Sheb Wooley, Myron Healey and Denver Pyle do their usual in secondary roles, as does Elaine Riley as the requisite (but hardly crucial) heroine.","popularity":0.8308,"poster_path":"/y53wo7if6Ws0M00T6gYpvO2YMnZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4928,"logo_path":null,"name":"Allied Artists Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":36989,"logo_path":null,"name":"Westwood Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1953-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Outlaw father against his sheriff son . . . in a gun fury story of the lawless west!","title":"Texas Bad Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wayne Morris","original_name":"Wayne Morris","popularity":0.2485,"profile_path":"/2HFQHQrPdlr8eRca5x9BAfeQnjc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Walt","credit_id":"55e8b0d39251413e3800358e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Ferguson","original_name":"Frank Ferguson","popularity":0.6918,"profile_path":"/u71gKHci5XMUrpOou8peFEYphXM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Gil","credit_id":"55e8b0dbc3a3682c700034c1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":85360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elaine Riley","original_name":"Elaine Riley","popularity":0.0969,"profile_path":"/cpF5bYczGW9YkmIz2MJCjaXqQZY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lois","credit_id":"55e8b0e39251413e320034b7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4080,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sheb Wooley","original_name":"Sheb Wooley","popularity":0.4018,"profile_path":"/3rBS9OS4oc00QMjVXg4kCW8J0jc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mack","credit_id":"55e8b0ec9251413e45003533","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denver Pyle","original_name":"Denver Pyle","popularity":0.9416,"profile_path":"/eYRwwhl3pWu3oNn1GKerUauooSV.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Tench","credit_id":"55e8b0f49251413e38003590","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Myron Healey","original_name":"Myron Healey","popularity":0.4291,"profile_path":"/fBokJvil9CnupCjfrBylnWmYyjB.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Jackson","credit_id":"5929a3f09251413b4104dfef","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mort Mills","original_name":"Mort Mills","popularity":0.5696,"profile_path":"/lSFwFQog617EIKnhUlZllxorH9u.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Bartender","credit_id":"5929a3fc9251413ba00494c0","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1230014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nelson Leigh","original_name":"Nelson Leigh","popularity":0.1034,"profile_path":"/qTVomtpRWQb1eUVlZvvWRMYjyuw.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Bradley","credit_id":"5929a407c3a368783e04e92a","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lewis D.
