This unconventional but heartfelt hunt upends typical artist biographies and delivers instead a funny, engaging and all together different kind of documentary.  \"a woman like that\" is a freewheeling tribute to an artist whose own bold life and inspiring message leaps across centuries to speak to us all. The enduring power of storytelling – in paintings, in films and in our lives is revealed, as the filmmaker learns that who gets to tell the story matters, and that maybe she too, can be “a woman like that.” [from official website]","popularity":0.0527,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Woman Like That","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1087760,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ellen Weissbrod","original_name":"Ellen Weissbrod","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55e6f739c3a3685f87002e4f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1583957","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
