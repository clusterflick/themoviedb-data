As well it re-articulates the body and conceptual happenings performed in the Eastern European context. The video is a homageto Nesa Paripovic happenings and body actions from the 1970s in Belgrade. The text is a political intervention in the field of theory regarding the question of global capitalism and the radical position of technology in the cyberworld with a clear reference to a cyberfeminst attitude and positioning. In this respect the question of sex and empathy in the cyberworld is raised as well as the ethical and political questioning of cloning and hybrid identities.
