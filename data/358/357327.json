And it may be that this is where what today we call art comes from - the humble scratch, graffiti.","popularity":0.4445,"poster_path":"/7zu3TFzyJAJRgNzxv6kdIJx8m4R.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62268,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kaboom Film and TV","origin_country":""},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Brief History of Graffiti","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1503443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Clay","original_name":"Richard Clay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"55e5ea8492514169ef00003e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1348891,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Clarke Powell","original_name":"Nick Clarke Powell","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55e5ea9c92514169e8000048","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68540,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charles Furneaux","original_name":"Charles Furneaux","popularity":0.1155,"profile_path":"/iCjuoPMFsOUmA5v5FhaQLFfxI5Q.jpg","credit_id":"55e5eaae92514169eb00003c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4994254","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7zu3TFzyJAJRgNzxv6kdIJx8m4R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2815,"name":"graffiti"},{"id":2816,"name":"street art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
