Its semi-animated graphics format conveys more than a little of the whimsy and infectious spirit in the eight-string guitarist's music, even as the bios of the individual band members and production credits thoroughly cover the academic side of this project. The segment featuring Charlie solo is a great opportunity to see how he plays his custom-designed guitar. You have to marvel at what a self-deprecating musician this Bay-area native is, but never more so than on \"Recess,\" where he refuses to show off or flaunt his technique in any way.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/5Vn4a8t9AfTcfp6PP7TAcn9mk8u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Charlie Hunter Quintet - Right Now Live","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1146058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie Hunter","original_name":"Charlie Hunter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/6TmEadtZFIOFHVi2Z06F85aeTJx.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"8 String Guitar, Pandero","credit_id":"55e71283c3a3685f980038ff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2709036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Ellis","original_name":"John Ellis","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/iJRYAiROXbGm12ex5gxGoNlL5qS.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"tenor saxophone, bass clarinet","credit_id":"5f09dbacd5ffcb003489295a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2709039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Derek Phillips","original_name":"Derek Phillips","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/Jrg89xCDNjEPSALUeAcZCaAT9Q.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"drums","credit_id":"5f09dbc993db920035482a90","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2709042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gregorie Maret","original_name":"Gregorie Maret","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/5FI6hcRasgK4CJPc7QVbG4SViR4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"chromatic harmonica","credit_id":"5f09dbf4d100b600360827d4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2709043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Curtis Fowlkes","original_name":"Curtis Fowlkes","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/yTKcEVisVYHQ8X4JWk0FIV8bPRi.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"trombone","credit_id":"5f09dc06efe37c0036c4c6d1","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5Vn4a8t9AfTcfp6PP7TAcn9mk8u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
