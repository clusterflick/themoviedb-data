Among them is a writer, whose corpus is larger than her output. We also meet a hard-of-hearing poet who can still hear the grass growing. There's a painter, a sculptor and more.

They have set up a small diner and engage lively with the artist from the colony.","popularity":0.1856,"poster_path":"/80cgcNGlkTTE1iXitJCxtuKdaTx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2379,"logo_path":null,"name":"Palladium","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1933-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"With Full Music","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"With Pipes and Drums","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Schenstrøm","original_name":"Carl Schenstrøm","popularity":0.1193,"profile_path":"/e8rJKXjL38FlI01CLD2FHJ4YXfN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Pat","credit_id":"55e48a5fc3a368272a0006e7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans W.
