With extreme, exaggerated body parts, some predators were loaded with outlandish or disproportionately sized appendages. Join world-renowned paleontologists and travel the globe to unearth some of the lesser-known but most surprising members of the dinosaur family: Mamenchisaurus, whose neck alone was longer than the rest of its body; Chasmosaurus, adorned with a fashionable crown of frilly spikes to attract the eyes of potential suitors; Spinosaurus, with massive extensions from its vertebrae that could have supported a sail or a hump; and Parasaurolophus, whose tube-like head crest may look odd to us, but was a mating magnet back in the day. Why did these animals ever adopt such strange appendages? What was their purpose - and why did these evolutionary changes die out?","popularity":0.3286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7521,"logo_path":"/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png","name":"National Geographic","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Weirdest Dinosaurs","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Bizzare Dinosaurs","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1270230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Tilling","original_name":"Roger Tilling","popularity":0.0465,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"55e4e21ac3a3681408000143","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1851596,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jenny Kubo","original_name":"Jenny Kubo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d6a3f34bac031831bd2370","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1851596,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jenny Kubo","original_name":"Jenny Kubo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d6a3f84355acb68b549039","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12616,"name":"dinosaur"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
