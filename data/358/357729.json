In a visually surreal world of facts and emotions—using documents from books and magazines—the video suggests a re-reading of the European space, i.e. Eastern and Western Europe. Referencing history, philosophy (Kant), and art, the video elaborates on the idea of Eastern Europe as the indivisible residua of all European atrocities. Eastern Europe is a piece of shit and the bloody symptom of the political, cultural, and epistemological failures of the 20th century.","popularity":0.1461,"poster_path":"/2Tu8BeV8EDjXH5RyQsQJDRistXj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28367,"logo_path":"/kw6n8hNwQXQSPlGdwVZvmbO0Haq.png","name":"RTV Slovenija","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"1999-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Flies of the Market Place","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":584959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vesna Jevnikar","original_name":"Vesna Jevnikar","popularity":0.0518,"profile_path":"/536Odoz1bi3dHwDro6PH4ql4Szn.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5c5fff120e0a2638236b5e78","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1934652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pavle Rakovec","original_name":"Pavle Rakovec","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5c5fff21c3a368386c87341d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1980308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darja Reichman","original_name":"Darja Reichman","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5c5fff310e0a261de56beb04","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1916185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Rupnik","original_name":"Ivan Rupnik","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5c5fff400e0a261deb6bdb48","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1811563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uroš Smolej","original_name":"Uroš Smolej","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/ixCyb4PQ73eYgfbi5D0DesTN9C8.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5c5fff57925141721cb7b9d5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1935095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matjaž Višnar","original_name":"Matjaž Višnar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5c5fff81c3a3683a468f5c6e","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1504535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aina Šmid","original_name":"Aina Šmid","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55e81d089251413e41001d2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1504534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marina Gržinić","original_name":"Marina Gržinić","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55e81cfcc3a3682c70001d08","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1469234,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Janez Štucin","original_name":"Janez Štucin","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5ffec00e0a261deb6bd9c9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1504535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aina Šmid","original_name":"Aina Šmid","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5ffe8dc3a3684d8d8daaa9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2239151,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Aljaž Rogelj","original_name":"Aljaž Rogelj","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5ffef69251413381bfe2f4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1504534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marina Gržinić","original_name":"Marina Gržinić","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5ffe870e0a261de56be9fd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3628052","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2Tu8BeV8EDjXH5RyQsQJDRistXj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
