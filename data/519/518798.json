Featuring 14 women and men in Toronto of South, East and Southeast Asian backgrounds, Orientations was the first documentary to explore the experiences and perspectives of queer Asians in North America. Capturing pivotal moments in Torontoâ€™s history, it presents an intimate portrait of the texture of gay live and politics at that time. Re:Orientations revisits seven of the original participants as they see anew the footage of their younger selves, and reflect on their lives and all that has changed over the intervening three decades. Their interviews are deepened and contextualized by conversations with six younger queer and trans activists, scholars and artists.","popularity":0.0975,"poster_path":"/42Twm0KAcyeb2xdvRBgLPNeW0u7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2016-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Re:Orientations","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1302855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Fung","original_name":"Richard Fung","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/6sVJR9nb4rE9tISZH32USSprk9i.jpg","credit_id":"5ad62037c3a3680c1601b36e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/42Twm0KAcyeb2xdvRBgLPNeW0u7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Inside Out: Toronto LGBT Film Festival","release_date":"2016-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
