The film takes us from the Trümmerlandschaften and their unique ecologies to the abandoned roofs of the Friedrichshagen Waterworks on the edge of the city. Encountering an extraordinary variety of spontaneous vegetation from all over the world that has sprouted along railway lines, street corners, and in the distinctive Brachen of Berlin. In Natura Urbana the changing vegetation of Berlin serves as a parallel history to war-time destruction, geo-political division, and the newest phase of urban transformation. Natura Urbana takes us on a unique journey through Berlin ranging from the botanical microcosm of cracked paving stones to elaborate attempts to map the entire city in terms of its distinctive ecological zones.","popularity":0.1199,"poster_path":"/j1pzX9Vq30tmA1iK378vFtM1PO2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Natura Urbana: The Brachen of Berlin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Natura Urbana: Die Brachen von Berlin","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2022937,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sarah Dockhorn","original_name":"Sarah Dockhorn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad289290e0a266c1c01a52c","department":"Crew","job":"Production Office Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2022934,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Madeleine Dallmeyer","original_name":"Madeleine Dallmeyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad288e40e0a266c2e018f53","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2022938,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Luise Schröder","original_name":"Luise Schröder","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad28935c3a3683ef9019865","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2022932,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sandra Jasper","original_name":"Sandra Jasper","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad288c7c3a3683f0301b03d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2022933,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Wiebke Hofmann","original_name":"Wiebke Hofmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad288d5925141737601810f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2022930,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Gandy","original_name":"Matthew Gandy","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad288ae0e0a266c1c01a49a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2022935,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Madeleine Dallmeyer","original_name":"Madeleine Dallmeyer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad288f20e0a266c31019a78","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2022931,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Matthew Gandy","original_name":"Matthew Gandy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad288b59251417364018063","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1112028,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jonathan Schorr","original_name":"Jonathan Schorr","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad2898cc3a3683f0001ab9d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8112246","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"tr","file_path":"/j1pzX9Vq30tmA1iK378vFtM1PO2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":723}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
