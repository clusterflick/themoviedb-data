Unable to cope, her uncommunicative son chooses to tune out of his parent’s arguments. Ki feebly refuses divorce to keep the family intact, but her husband is already eagerly anticipating a new marriage with a baby coming on the way.  Ki has her searing anger building up behind the façade of normalcy. On the verge of a breakdown with pleading fallen on deaf ears, she takes matters into her own hands.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Silence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2024527,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lam Hei-nok","original_name":"Lam Hei-nok","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad616139251415dd2018454","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
