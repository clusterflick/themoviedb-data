Ordered to return a washed suit and pocket watch to an old customer, Nine starts a journey within the area soon to be transformed beyond recognition. He encounters a number of local residents who treasure and preserve the unique charm of the area. A conversation with his grandfather who repairs old chairs prompted Nine reflections on the values of preservation and the apparent priority of all things new only made possible by sacrificing things and memories from older eras. This observant piece stars veteran actress Lora Lu and stage actors Au Yeung Chun and Sheung Ming-fai.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Long Ride","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2024528,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ng Chun","original_name":"Ng Chun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad61794c3a3680bff015d5a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
