Thereʼs little doubt the 7,000 soldiers of the Military Intelligence Service helped shorten World War II by as much as two years. They were fluent in Japanese. They were interrogators, interpreters and linguists. But who were they? With documents classified and buried in government vaults, historians struggled to tell the MIS story. “The Registry” profiles surviving MIS veterans Seiki Oshiro and Grant Ichikawa and other vets who help tell the unitʼs story.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/egGLYSlPhRLD7QlZlKuEgq9Yw6B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Registry","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2024081,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Kubota","original_name":"Bill Kubota","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad54452c3a3680c0900a30f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2024082,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Ozone","original_name":"Steve Ozone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad544610e0a2660bc00ad3b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oLKhCUJBZmAWuLOuPlzQozNsA6D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/egGLYSlPhRLD7QlZlKuEgq9Yw6B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5nB6ZPbxtzb2zwhnsO14ssOrGar.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":717}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Registry Trailer","key":"a4dsbN5dwV0","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-05-05T19:37:12.000Z","id":"609da001807298006fd9d0e3"}]}}}
