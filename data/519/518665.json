Long known as a center of drugs and prostitution, and also once home to a thriving Chinese enclave, itâ€™s now peppered with boutique shops, new bars and restaurants and the just-debuted Little Caesars Arena. This feature from noted Detroit artist Nicole Macdonald mixes a personal, journalistic and historic approach as it looks at who and what remains in the Corridor. We hear how residents survived, and how they sometimes didn't, as gentrification redefines the space.","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":"/pQGEfiGiF2e0OXbk937BfM89DuX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Days of Chinatown","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2024075,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicole Macdonald","original_name":"Nicole Macdonald","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad53fbe9251415dc600914d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2024075,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicole Macdonald","original_name":"Nicole Macdonald","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad53faac3a3680bff008b14","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7657546","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zl2JdC7hEjl7fN9WvwFRA0D2Vz1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8ulGRGTkDNkHTUwswJqCp5V63Kl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pQGEfiGiF2e0OXbk937BfM89DuX.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8emZ28Rfusi7hn6VcUWUzuhHLVp.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7eMD3Ib8Xm5z4YVhyqaQjXowuRc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Freep Film Festival","release_date":"2017-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
