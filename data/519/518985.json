The waters of Goderich Bay, in Freetown, have been blessed with an abundance of fish. Idrissa, a local fisherman, and his neighbors know that the goddess looks over them; however, they must still battle against international commercial fishing boats, illegal fishing and drug traffickers. Sierra Leone, ranked as one of the world's poorest countries by the UN, lacks an education system, health facilities and suffers from staggering unemployment. The Children of Mama Wata portrays the dignity and faith and the day-to-day lives of the inhabitants of Goderich.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/kWqr7hXTygsEdgsoK2nOJgPey7Y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52710,"logo_path":null,"name":"Making DOC Producciones","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Los hijos de Mama Wata","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1463084,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Juan Antonio Moreno Amador","original_name":"Juan Antonio Moreno Amador","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad72bf89251413b3700d5ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1463085,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Silvia Venegas Venegas","original_name":"Silvia Venegas Venegas","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad72c03c3a36847f500c542","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1773549","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kWqr7hXTygsEdgsoK2nOJgPey7Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
