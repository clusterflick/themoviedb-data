Glen, now an Ontario Member of Provincial Parliament, was one of the first openly gay elected politicians in Canada. He adopted Mike during an era when homophobic stereotypes often prevented gay men and women from adopting children. Glen and Mike's relationship is always tenuous and always turbulent as they struggle to define themselves together and alone.","popularity":0.2782,"poster_path":"/oDW8yi4zS4ZRxZgWOY7Vi7dtD1a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Kind of Family","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1058622,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Robert Lower","original_name":"Robert Lower","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad3ecdd9251412978008b85","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2023537,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Koster","original_name":"Andrew Koster","popularity":0.0697,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad3ec67925141296f00933f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0223604","wikidata_id":"Q43302520","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oDW8yi4zS4ZRxZgWOY7Vi7dtD1a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2393,"name":"adoption"},{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
