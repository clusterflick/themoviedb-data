Born into a creative family, he was also an avid painter, musician, church-goer, documentarian and father. After he was married (to Edythe) and had children, he decided to continue his passion for filming by documenting their lives. Over the next two or three decades, he amassed his family’s whole life as they became part of the middle class of America. Meanwhile, in the early 21st century, Ali Kazimi was bidding on an online auction for some 16mm nitrate film cans with Silas’ name on them. After winning them and starting the process of cleaning them up, he was contacted by a lady who was bidding on another lot of Silas’ films and wanted to know who had won the second lot. From there, Kazimi began to interview Silas’ daughter, Irena Lam, and other Chinese-American people who grew up at the same time as Irena as well as experts in Sino-American culture.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/cjPbgrkzm8VIjDwDGRClDgJRMBS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104944,"logo_path":null,"name":"Asli Films Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2016-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Random Acts of Legacy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1696902,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ali Kazimi","original_name":"Ali Kazimi","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/iTZAXzVJIEfWnCz0f2qgnNPxij7.jpg","credit_id":"5ad61ecc9251415dc0017e53","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1696902,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ali Kazimi","original_name":"Ali Kazimi","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/iTZAXzVJIEfWnCz0f2qgnNPxij7.jpg","credit_id":"5b079b3b92514172770017e9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1696902,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ali Kazimi","original_name":"Ali Kazimi","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/iTZAXzVJIEfWnCz0f2qgnNPxij7.jpg","credit_id":"5b079b600e0a267b720020d4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1696902,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ali Kazimi","original_name":"Ali Kazimi","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/iTZAXzVJIEfWnCz0f2qgnNPxij7.jpg","credit_id":"5b079b500e0a267b5d001f4b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1092565,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Philip Strong","original_name":"Philip Strong","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b079bbb9251417259001e93","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2050218,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary Popovich","original_name":"Gary Popovich","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/2eh4aPch0YUoicqWrqumVWJsuPi.jpg","credit_id":"5b079b7c0e0a267b8a001fd2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1696902,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ali Kazimi","original_name":"Ali Kazimi","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/iTZAXzVJIEfWnCz0f2qgnNPxij7.jpg","credit_id":"5b079b929251417236002009","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6151812","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.695,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cjPbgrkzm8VIjDwDGRClDgJRMBS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":712}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hot Docs International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2016-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
