Her grandmother returns to East Germany to help build a Socialist society. Only after the German reunification young Esther finds out about her Jewish relatives and spends carefree days in Israel. The Golan Swimmingpool lovingly explores the Jewish identity of a family living in two political systems. The film investigates their ideals and worlds and questions how much of it is left in today’s generation.","popularity":0.1353,"poster_path":"/zVV6EO6N7bKgIUYVJVzed5PYtxM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81793,"logo_path":"/4dQiA56otRDbq8EQPAiF6WtfP2O.png","name":"Zischlermann
