More than 60 years later, a group of five veterans, barely adults when they enlisted, break the silence to talk about how homosexual behaviour \"was even more unmentionable than cancer.\" Yet amidst the brutality of war, instances of sexual awakening among soldiers and officers were occuring. Initially, the Army overlooked it, but as the war advanced, they began to crack down: military tribunals, threats of imprisonment, discharge and public exposure. After the war, officers accused of homosexuality were discharged. Back home in Canada, reputations and careers were ruined. For the young men who had served their country with valour, this final chapter was often too much to bear. Based on the book Courting Homosexuals in the Military by Paul Jackson.","popularity":0.2875,"poster_path":"/w24OUVK9vVSQMkPfX0Dh1lWWQRh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2004-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Open Secrets","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2023969,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Jackson","original_name":"Paul Jackson","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad5017d9251415dcf00621b","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1978385,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José Torrealba","original_name":"José Torrealba","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad5015e9251415dc900605e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1978385,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José Torrealba","original_name":"José Torrealba","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad501399251415dbd005bba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0410405","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/w24OUVK9vVSQMkPfX0Dh1lWWQRh.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":1088,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xFEXgNc7KHHmZFKc8sY4DsKMzm3.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":736}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6092,"name":"army"},{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":10180,"name":"male homosexuality"},{"id":13065,"name":"soldier"},{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":193534,"name":"canadian army"},{"id":254199,"name":"homosexual soldier"},{"id":258533,"name":"gay theme"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"14A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
