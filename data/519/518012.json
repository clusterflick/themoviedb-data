Even though the cycle is coming to its end, they inhabitants refuse to leave their land. The landscape of San Rosendo: the mountains, the river, the trees, the roads, the houses and the railway ruins, retains traces of the past and the history of those men. The Noise of Trains portrays a several villagers, mostly old people, that carry out small actions during a day. These characters are defined from their gestures, movements and looks. They are closely related with the place they live in and they are another element of the landscape. This is a film about spaces, atmospheres and distances, where the framings talk about the mood of a place that is disappearing slowly. It has no interviews or voices in off, but the ambient sounds transmit the sensations of loneliness and abandonment that surround to the characters.","popularity":0.0717,"poster_path":"/eDw887saqQI9O538ASjkAdqtqh1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2015-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Noise of Trains","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2022378,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cristian Saldia","original_name":"Cristian Saldia","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad110730e0a2631ba002baa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2022378,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cristian Saldia","original_name":"Cristian Saldia","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad11080c3a368787e00254a","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2022378,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cristian Saldia","original_name":"Cristian Saldia","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad1108d0e0a2631c60026db","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2022379,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Catalina Donoso","original_name":"Catalina Donoso","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad1109b0e0a2631b100276d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2022378,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cristian Saldia","original_name":"Cristian Saldia","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad110ad0e0a2631c60026fc","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":72814,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Soledad Salfate","original_name":"Soledad Salfate","popularity":0.0858,"profile_path":"/3TivNgafncpD8aoTd720rKGpMM4.jpg","credit_id":"5ad110be92514139380021fe","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2022378,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cristian Saldia","original_name":"Cristian Saldia","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad110c8c3a36878ac002228","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2022380,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Cristián Freund","original_name":"Cristián Freund","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad110ea925141392c0026a3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5729712","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.717,"height":1255,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eDw887saqQI9O538ASjkAdqtqh1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
