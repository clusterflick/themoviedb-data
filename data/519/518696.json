The digital sprites flutter throughout each other's daily lives and dramas in a manner that evokes a cross between The Legend of Zelda and MTV's The Real World. At night the characters escape into digital dreams that eventually collide, via partying, into a surrealistic, psychedelic episode blurring the line between reality and oblivion.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Too Shall Pass Away","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2024169,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"C.
