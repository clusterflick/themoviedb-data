Her search leads to an old Victorian mansion filled with dust and cobwebs. While cleaning, she finds a mysterious doorway which leads to an unused attic. There she finds a diary entitled “The Personal Memoirs of Molly Mae”, dated 1887. She reads it, becomes fascinated and eventually obsessed with the characters. Her obsession leads to strange and mystical experiences and she begins to physically feel the emotions of the writer Molly Mae. Molly Mae, Jason, her lover, and his family the Cromwells, magically take form and absorb Amy into their existence. As Amy falls in love with Jason, the viewer is compelled to discern what is fantasy and what is reality in this tender yet torrid love story.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/9trIgIj9BF8Flh0r7XinfVsviyw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memoirs of a Chamber Maid","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","title":"Bir Hizmetcinin Anilari","type":"VHS"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Memoires of a Chamber Maid","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":106428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Krista Lane","original_name":"Krista Lane","popularity":1.34,"profile_path":"/tJPRaRfLKsPQ0lfroThvVLgvCC7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Amy Rogers","credit_id":"5ad3425ec3a3683f030295f8","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1135479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ona Zee","original_name":"Ona Zee","popularity":7.798,"profile_path":"/kRyvJHCTDKojLSDHZXgO8s4VZ8d.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Gretta","credit_id":"5ad3426292514173730261f7","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":558779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renee Summers","original_name":"Renee Summers","popularity":2.306,"profile_path":"/joJfRU8I3dVfPmrJEOz5mdqjstg.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Cindy","credit_id":"5ad342850e0a266c310278f0","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":45011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shanna McCullough","original_name":"Shanna McCullough","popularity":7.657,"profile_path":"/dHHJQuChdS1iWYOBNmpN7rcv7ky.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Molly Mae","credit_id":"5ad3427b925141736a024d39","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":2785320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandon","original_name":"Brandon","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Jason","credit_id":"61ae5bbeac617c0042942ebc","order":4},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":588856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Random","original_name":"Nick Random","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/8wJG4FbtF7QYoOfwj0ReldqyjGS.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Cromwell","credit_id":"5ad342a89251417370024ed9","order":5},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1018997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Bullock","original_name":"Robert Bullock","popularity":1.4,"profile_path":"/iWjKvr93RmffH22LmWtLCSrYFOD.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jonathan","credit_id":"5ad342910e0a266c280264c4","order":6},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":2030194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wayne Stevens","original_name":"Wayne Stevens","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Ned Beasley","credit_id":"6170bafd6728a8002a6aa079","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":45007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Edwards","original_name":"Eric Edwards","popularity":3.247,"profile_path":"/NVfWLufRjMueposhVjwmZv0GuM.jpg","credit_id":"6170bb97963864008ce96e7d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":558779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renee Summers","original_name":"Renee Summers","popularity":2.306,"profile_path":"/joJfRU8I3dVfPmrJEOz5mdqjstg.jpg","credit_id":"6170bba86d4c97009204f687","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":104558,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jack Remy","original_name":"Jack Remy","popularity":1.38,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6170bbb8c8f85800434d834c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":45007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Edwards","original_name":"Eric Edwards","popularity":3.247,"profile_path":"/NVfWLufRjMueposhVjwmZv0GuM.jpg","credit_id":"6170bbcb963864004345d830","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":45007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Edwards","original_name":"Eric Edwards","popularity":3.247,"profile_path":"/NVfWLufRjMueposhVjwmZv0GuM.jpg","credit_id":"5ad342530e0a266c22028941","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0189726","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9trIgIj9BF8Flh0r7XinfVsviyw.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ebyNTb1rvSHaPYPjGadheV3cHj0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1987-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
