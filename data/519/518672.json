The resilient Detroiters on Wendell’s route share stories of pushing against racial segregation in housing, challenging industrial and political disinvestment and living on reduced pensions as a result of Detroit’s bankruptcy. They also share stories of hope and propose creative ways to re-imagine an inclusive, equitable and productive city. Foregrounding the voices of African-American working class Detroiters, it offers a nuanced and complex understanding of a city at the crossroads.","popularity":0.4667,"poster_path":"/drmHa0v3aTVF0gaiKV219OSsT7K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113790,"logo_path":"/g7FpsadP1UG9MotNi54RvE5hiGY.png","name":"JustFilms / Ford
