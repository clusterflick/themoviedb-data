This story tells us the life of a boy who, from his very birth, is adopted by Javier Artal a member of a Spanish landowning family but within this family he is repudiated by his father’s elder brother because of his race and origin. This fact will mark him as he grows up in a comfortable environment although he is aware he does not really form part of it. The continuous in-and-outs of the story allow us to get to know Lázaro who is strong in fighting and tender in love but who will never get to know his true origins. The story takes place on an estate run-down from constant fighting which was the famous Artal Brothers Estate before the war. They arrived with their wives from Spain and their descendants were already born on the other side of the Atlantic.","popularity":0.4727,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":100676,"logo_path":null,"name":"Saguel Film S.L.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2005-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Las llaves de la independencia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":311531,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fernando Carrillo","original_name":"Fernando Carrillo","popularity":0.1422,"profile_path":"/68SubJUhe9SAy6BEcoNhJlUzbYE.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lázaro","credit_id":"659fd7f55294e70125c59a28","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fernando Luján","original_name":"Fernando Luján","popularity":0.1616,"profile_path":"/th9wBuEvjHk4GdEmYAL8ZfDwdZ3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Demetrio","credit_id":"659fd80c1bf876012dac76fd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":258049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charo López","original_name":"Charo López","popularity":0.3102,"profile_path":"/g4NOfEwhBlcj3qGEDNe0IPR6RGD.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"659fd81ac14fee01246d7bc3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Sancho","original_name":"José Sancho","popularity":0.1747,"profile_path":"/tN3yTjahuAQuo51EbSV9ERT4mbG.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"659fd8252e06970124745df9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1074447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcela Walerstein","original_name":"Marcela Walerstein","popularity":0.1975,"profile_path":"/9kpxY8K6hDb812cHr5K5hL1qWCU.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"659fd834b1131f01217a81be","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miguel Molina","original_name":"Miguel Molina","popularity":0.137,"profile_path":"/x2nmTfsnLGYRkpRDWH2O9JPyozG.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"659fd842b1131f01217a81c8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yohana Cobo","original_name":"Yohana Cobo","popularity":0.1635,"profile_path":"/v5QyuzyKWTENEeQ6FdnoCCvEVOH.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"659fd86b5294e70128c59976","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73769,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Gil","original_name":"Carlos Gil","popularity":0.0947,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659fd7bf84448e013010d1e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1507947,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ana Diosdado","original_name":"Ana Diosdado","popularity":0.1074,"profile_path":"/sHA4G4V7cUNz5vfFPByQflXu2Yw.jpg","credit_id":"659fd7d38de0ae01228c2db0","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1822626,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Miguel Fernández","original_name":"Miguel Fernández","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659fd8a43cd12c0127f06554","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33824,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Fernando Arribas","original_name":"Fernando Arribas","popularity":0.0763,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659fd8ba8de0ae01228c2e01","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1143475,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"José María Biurrún","original_name":"José María Biurrún","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659fd8d42e06970121745afc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
