Nancy, who makes counterculture cinema-themed t-shirts, lives in \"Camille's Castle,\" a frozen-in-time legacy home for displaced artists and outcasts. Together, they search for the remaining scraps of San Francisco's Summer of Love, and wind up at odds with each other. Countercurrents is an aggressive tribute to the counterculture films of the late 60's, with \"easter eggs\" in no short supply.","popularity":0.2014,"poster_path":"/uzkpbsBttFZiDSgEBAoia4GkEWJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Stanley never learned to avoid swimming against the tides.","title":"Countercurrents","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1956106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jarrod LaBine","original_name":"Jarrod LaBine","popularity":0.0575,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Stanley","credit_id":"659f41162ceb530127680dae","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3238560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Corbo","original_name":"Emily Corbo","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Nancy","credit_id":"659f4126dbf1440122399891","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1458485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Macarena Abad","original_name":"Macarena Abad","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Olivia","credit_id":"659f413200bfe801310637bc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4474894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tara DeMoulin","original_name":"Tara DeMoulin","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Camille","credit_id":"659f4147dbbb4201215b099d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1369323,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brecht Andersch","original_name":"Brecht Andersch","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Graham","credit_id":"659f41592dc9dc013020fe3f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2545189,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klarissa Barskaya","original_name":"Кларисса Барская","popularity":0.0465,"profile_path":"/rArNUPgPd8qGqDfX9mQAUAWliwL.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mora","credit_id":"659f41a9daf57c0131c0e565","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3431079,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joel Roth","original_name":"Joel Roth","popularity":0.0941,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"'Uncle' Al","credit_id":"659f41c400bfe8012e0638a1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4474896,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristina Yarmolich","original_name":"Kristina Yarmolich","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Anthea","credit_id":"659f41de111da10121fd4996","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1811974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Kao","original_name":"Jeff Kao","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"James","credit_id":"659f41f8f04d01012e615caa","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2075731,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Aaron Hollander","original_name":"Aaron Hollander","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659f40ce79b3d401276a4250","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4275162,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michelle Anton Allen","original_name":"Michelle Anton Allen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659f40f2111da10124fd4927","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1891214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Kremer","original_name":"Daniel Kremer","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/YYDkEPseKxZsxvh6890JT2Rt0b.jpg","credit_id":"659f40b779b3d4012d6a41cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1891214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Kremer","original_name":"Daniel Kremer","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/YYDkEPseKxZsxvh6890JT2Rt0b.jpg","credit_id":"665a166e51725b351b942303","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1956106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jarrod LaBine","original_name":"Jarrod LaBine","popularity":0.0575,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"665a166668635a7fb1752906","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22077112","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uzkpbsBttFZiDSgEBAoia4GkEWJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":842}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
