Together they’ve spent almost 50 of them doing musicology. They don't \"live out their days\", they enjoy life and make sense of it. They write, work, go in for sports, hold concerts, build a country house. They are not interested in philistine values. These people live a spiritual life and argue heatedly all day long about music, literature and philosophy.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Emil and Ella","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4476986,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elizaveta Makarova","original_name":"Elizaveta Makarova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a0da75f5cb21012cb1d594","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
