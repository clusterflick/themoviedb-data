Despite carving out new lives for themselves—Aly has found refuge in religion, Viv is a queer artist, and Dmitri is a charismatic schemer—each is in the midst of their crisis. Their attempts at reconciliation are complicated further when Fyodor is murdered and they must finally face the truth about their dark past. Part murder mystery, part spiritual quest, The Karamazovs follows Liz, who pieces together memories of that eventful week.","popularity":0.3494,"poster_path":"/ynLTZo5BWftm5cYsLqJnSf9fOLI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":218074,"logo_path":null,"name":"Village Park
