Wild and Wet is an ode to Neptune and it introduces Matt Majors who is a major find with a major meat. In an industry where mighty manhood is mandatory, Mr. Majors has the most impressive dick to be seen onscreen in a long, long time. Before we get ahead of ourselves, let's make it clear that Majors is a fine lookin' young man, with a natural build and a bubblebutt. However, it is the dick that is both the cake and the icing thereon. It is long, thick uncut—the head is incredibly bulbous—and best of all, he can blow his own horn. Matt Majors is what Studio 2000's quest for newcomers is all about—the epitome of “mega-meat.” Best of all, he shares his wealth of “talent” in two scorching scenes.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/nYokccH0yd8irePjFsYKtXTBwgw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111582,"logo_path":"/lv7W9er923HNeSbVYwQBYtHjd6i.png","name":"Studio 2000","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wild and Wet","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":550208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seth Dickens","original_name":"Seth Dickens","popularity":0.652,"profile_path":"/6ATBg9jGtHN1FDmTt4ibUCRzTGQ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"659e829424b333014c14e89b","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":2543172,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Nelson","original_name":"Dave Nelson","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/856Fl9P5QnZ1ZB2bjYafVCLdE9g.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"659e82a69590e30095f623c6","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":2964001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gordon Gage","original_name":"Gordon Gage","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/8adE0Keyqfs7IFr5j3lETMfXhzu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"659e82afd6590b01a386e6a1","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":3219936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kurt Wolfe","original_name":"Kurt Wolfe","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/tiYtCVMyq4Z6u0tYEF6sET8GnAy.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"659e82c39590e3014ac071c9","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":2517519,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Rockwell","original_name":"Mark Rockwell","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/neSoPRJmTXcqdJujBC1fUhTcOXB.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"659e82cfcb75d10148e0f693","order":4},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":147577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Majors","original_name":"Matt Majors","popularity":1.4,"profile_path":"/tKZzJDdRYTYStozQ33FuVPjKRnq.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"659e82dae8999b00ee926311","order":5},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":147585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Mattel","original_name":"Michel Mattel","popularity":0.694,"profile_path":"/nhIcSsmf4me0dWCC4o1wHToorg8.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"659e82e424b333014c14e8c4","order":6},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":2525893,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richie Fine","original_name":"Richie Fine","popularity":1.582,"profile_path":"/dejtgTo3fPklmHkDly8CQyIO6Ob.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"659e82ed7776f001a4a555bd","order":7},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":4473730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trevor Halston","original_name":"Trevor Halston","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"659e82f5d6590b00ed2cd15c","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":581390,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Travis","original_name":"John Travis","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659ea034cb75d101a2d69a50","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.657,"height":761,"iso_639_1":"dz","file_path":"/nYokccH0yd8irePjFsYKtXTBwgw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
