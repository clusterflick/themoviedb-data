She’s just moved across the country for her father Harry’s medical treatment, and as her father declines and her mother Naomi is consumed with caring for him, Johanna feels horribly alone. In desperation, she makes a call out into the universe for a good spirit to save her family. But as the long summer days wear on, and a series of increasingly disturbing events rips through her home, she begins to fear that something else has come instead — a terrifying presence from some dark corner of the universe that has latched on to her family and is now eating them from the inside.","popularity":0.7864,"poster_path":"/rQ58nnGx5FiSM4Gr3MaNnbTxaLb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":181874,"logo_path":"/crrgXvLhDO9c57HYrbO4H58Vxmb.png","name":"Fifth Season","origin_country":"US"},{"id":106178,"logo_path":null,"name":"51 Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Family","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":47720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Wilson","original_name":"Ruth Wilson","popularity":1.3854,"profile_path":"/dKJA3nMTlueNK0sAmKM6P9WKJnB.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"65fdc3c90929f6016499f52e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Chaplin","original_name":"Ben Chaplin","popularity":0.6214,"profile_path":"/oJc9gA7cRvRg1v4tgeAmpkaqFxO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65a0bcbadb4ed601295f76fa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3849712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucinda Lee Dawson Gray","original_name":"Lucinda Lee Dawson Gray","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65a0bccaa6a4c1012e43ef93","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allan Corduner","original_name":"Allan Corduner","popularity":0.2686,"profile_path":"/9bZTEBUjY02UeooNnghZXxKfiO7.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65a0bcdaccde04012e8b6bd6","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2077576,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamin Finkel","original_name":"Benjamin Finkel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a0bc90ccde0401228b6aa1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2077576,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamin Finkel","original_name":"Benjamin Finkel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ed1763cadb6b0148d52820","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4480478,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gus Corwin","original_name":"Gus Corwin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6733911112d729010b922fd9","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30834999","wikidata_id":"Q124850759","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1041,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rQ58nnGx5FiSM4Gr3MaNnbTxaLb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":694}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"South by Southwest Film & TV Festival","release_date":"2024-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
