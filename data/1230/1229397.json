Brandon live streamed the vicious murder and posted images of Biancaâ€™s corpse on the internet. The content went viral and was shared widely throughout multiple social media platforms. Clark pled guilty to the murder of Devins and has since remained silent about why he committed the murder and why he posted the gratuitous and vile images online.\r In this one-off documentary, Yinka Bokinni travels to New York State to investigate the murder and the aftermath. In a tense stand-off, Yinka interviews Brandon Clark, the killer in the infamous Attica Prison. It is the first time Clark has spoken to the media as Yinka attempts to find out why he committed the crime, why he posted it online and if he would apologise for his vile actions.","popularity":0.0503,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Interview With a Killer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30221916","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
