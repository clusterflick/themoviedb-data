Here, based on collectivist ideas, they established a large camp, Camp Ashraf. The organization became increasingly tied to its leaders, and in the early 1990s, it was decided that hundreds of children in the camp would be raised by sympathizers abroad. Amir, Parwin, Hanif, and Atefeh are some of those who ended up in Sweden, and in Sara Moein's deeply engaging documentary, they narrate their experiences to a rich archive of materials. They also try to reconnect with the organization and their parents, who are now in Albania.","popularity":0.2813,"poster_path":"/19hJnDDaghgMCXnrcJNfWTUlONK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Children of Camp Ashraf","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4476605,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sara Moein","original_name":"Sara Moein","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a08477d207f30125e733c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30760295","wikidata_id":"Q126209609","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j7iRwth94oc3h8zgHc45AcJ38dv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8yCzChnrnBU18zvPzkdjrlCTAdE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6XPJDoBR7x7sZLaLHXOVcOEup8F.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/crpkppVHTnqU0Tf9t7Q4U1x0l4R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"sv","file_path":"/19hJnDDaghgMCXnrcJNfWTUlONK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Göteborg Film Festival","release_date":"2024-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
