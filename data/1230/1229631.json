Using scientific techniques of photogrammetry and underwater sensors, she follows the course of the water, beyond the waves, scraping the benthic sea floor, the domain of the riparian and the lacustrine, to read the effects of human intervention. Considering time in its thickness, she explores hydrology and its mythologies, questions in a poetic way what happens in our landscapes and suggests what might happen.","popularity":0.0971,"poster_path":"/3VSMl0JRLa1FgmGADSQWNSRuspE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Riparia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2133827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emilija Škarnulytė","original_name":"Emilija Škarnulytė","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/nYulQSMUXlEJkRU67S977xneN74.jpg","credit_id":"65a02297945d360130aebb0e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3sqOFsEIXJKCYT8lRqKT9eaitZd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3VSMl0JRLa1FgmGADSQWNSRuspE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":810}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
