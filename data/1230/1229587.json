At first, the house next door had been demolished and was going to be rebuilt, Suzuki then decided to take a time-lapse photo of how the house was going to be built. However, while shooting, the movement of the clouds amazed the filmmaker who became more interested in capturing them.  In September, Emperor Showa fell ill and was reported to be in critical condition, this inspired Suzuki to shoot \"the last sky of the Showa era\".","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/2LqZ7lp1Du0vdFi4vW3mnQHo7zf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Integration Of Winds","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2142869,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suzuki Shiroyasu","original_name":"鈴木志郎康","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a0065e907f26012e20f620","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/33qHJCy9G9D7G2pFvZU8CJxA5Ec.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2LqZ7lp1Du0vdFi4vW3mnQHo7zf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
