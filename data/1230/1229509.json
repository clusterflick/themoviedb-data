The project met with fierce resistance from local farmers right from the start. The directorial trio Heuser/Marcello/Wittenberg accompanied the conflict from 1981-83 and instead of a simple reportage, they provide a picture puzzle of struggles: international and local, historical, present and future. The music of the Chilean communist and singer-songwriter Viktor Jara, who was murdered in 1973, pervades the film. Images from Brazil and the exploitation of the rural population there through neo-colonial expansion are juxtaposed with rallies in Stuttgart and German political talk shows.
