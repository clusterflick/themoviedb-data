In the documentary, he talks about the personal and socio-political contexts of his life and confesses in it his admiring relationship with Vysočina, which is for him an \"anchor in his soul\". The viewer learns what the former prime minister thinks about and how he reflects on the recent past, and in this way he can actually learn something about himself, because Miloš Zeman is one of the most powerful men in our modern history and therefore also, in a certain sense, the embodiment of Czech society.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miloš Zeman - politician's obituary and celebration of Vysočina","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222792,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Sedláček","original_name":"Robert Sedláček","popularity":0.1148,"profile_path":"/8TNcMFOtSQ4duVYho8DFUXyTZLF.jpg","credit_id":"67fe1e33437f0b80eead2550","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4348530,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michal Hájek","original_name":"Michal Hájek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fe1e5a3015363286d97eee","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223730,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Radim Procházka","original_name":"Radim Procházka","popularity":0.0569,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fe1e6a9d1f778ab8995d87","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3621972","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
