The program is believed to have played a role in his eventual downfall by amplifying his proclivity for self-criticism. During the interview, John Freeman posed probing questions about Hancock's life and career. Despite his admiration for the interviewer, Hancock seemed uneasy but responded candidly. Known for his inherent self-critical nature, it is frequently posited that this interview intensified that trait, ultimately contributing to his subsequent challenges. According to Roger, Hancock's brother, \"It was the most significant misstep he ever took. I believe it all stemmed from that moment. Self-analysis - that became his undoing.","popularity":0.2802,"poster_path":"/yTnj3vTIOg5od5pm4pKyDher2G5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1960-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Face to Face: Tony Hancock","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":217914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Hancock","original_name":"Tony Hancock","popularity":0.1694,"profile_path":"/cfZhojd9NmPkbI5dyOjISqPMhge.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"659fef308de0ae01228c3316","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1495828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Freeman","original_name":"John Freeman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"659fefb95294e7012bc59dd7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1504907,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Hugh Burnett","original_name":"Hugh Burnett","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659ff00daaf8970130976524","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1470265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Feliks Topolski","original_name":"Feliks Topolski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659ff0e2c14fee01246d80ad","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1504907,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Hugh Burnett","original_name":"Hugh Burnett","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659ff0a6efea7a012bdb8aee","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0575277","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2590,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yTnj3vTIOg5od5pm4pKyDher2G5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1727}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1960-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
