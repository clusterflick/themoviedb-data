In those days he was making entries in his diary. Almost fifty years later, in 1990, Murcia, Ramón Gaya read for some friends some of his notes about Venice, which were part of his book Diary of a Painter, published in 1984 by the Pre-Textos publishing house. This short is a tribute to the thoughts of Ramón Gaya and to that emotional reading, and also to that mysterious city that “is not just a city, a place, but an existence.”","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":218125,"logo_path":null,"name":"Acción Visual","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La serenissima","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4475876,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gonzalo Ballester","original_name":"Gonzalo Ballester","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a01f031bf8760124ac8671","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4475876,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gonzalo Ballester","original_name":"Gonzalo Ballester","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a01ed0b1131f01247a8c81","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4475876,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gonzalo Ballester","original_name":"Gonzalo Ballester","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a01eea8de0ae01318c3c08","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
