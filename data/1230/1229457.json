Ted Nugent runs through his classic rock guitar licks from the start \"Journey To The Centre Of The Mind to classics such as \"Cat Scratch Fever\" and \"Stranglehold\" to more recent songs like \"Don't Tread On Me\". The DVD also comes with an instructional TAB booklet.  While I'm not sure if you'll actually learn anything from this video, the entire DVD is a hoot to watch with Ted talking non-stop like he does, riffing away and somewhere along saying \"How do I do it? I don't know\".  But one things for sure and this message came across - The songs aren't that complicated but you gotta have the F#$%en attitude!","popularity":0.1003,"poster_path":"/4czbMinhyqJU6gjD3SMUnYvCoZA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"You gotta have the f#$%en attitude!","title":"Ted Nugent - Instructional DVD For Guitar","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":170468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Nugent","original_name":"Ted Nugent","popularity":0.2632,"profile_path":"/8jHbx8a5GAFRcpoBBLDYTIT8sRG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"659f9ff1b1131f01307a73aa","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4czbMinhyqJU6gjD3SMUnYvCoZA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":710}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":327346,"name":"hal leonard"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Released on DVD and VHS.
