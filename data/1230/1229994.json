Since it's so easy to lose where you're at and what your doing when shooting improvisational stop-motion, it was shot to sound map made from Holst's \"Mars, Bringer of War,\" in order to give the visuals long-form structure. It was designed to run silently as a loop on large-scale exterior video panels of Seahawks Stadium in Seattle. The credits occur in the middle because of the loop design, with the first frames interlaced with the last, so it could silently cycle on and on through the night.","popularity":0.0944,"poster_path":"/43ZrokgX6ODn1aBxDOrf9F4wkJj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Populi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Russo","original_name":"David Russo","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a10c4df5cb210123b1e5b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/43ZrokgX6ODn1aBxDOrf9F4wkJj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
