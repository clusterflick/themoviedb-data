He was tortured and beaten to death because he was gay and had fought for gay rights. Shocked by this gruesome murder in his home country, filmmaker Appolain Siewe sets off for Cameroon to find out more about the situation of LGBTQ people there. He soon realizes that Lembembe's murder is no isolated case. Why is homophobia so firmly anchored in Cameroon society? What role does colonization have to play in this? Sieweâ€™s own experiences, moving encounters with activists who fight for tolerance in their country despite all the risks, and his conversations with Cameroon scientists, sociologists, and human rights activists offer a comprehensive insight into society in Cameroon.","popularity":0.085,"poster_path":"/dvqN7v5VrutMmVyNnSv269QEIjh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Code of Fear","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4476292,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Appolain Siewe","original_name":"Appolain Siewe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a05df85b07140129fdd146","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4476292,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Appolain Siewe","original_name":"Appolain Siewe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a05dfebd990c012becda9d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31510446","wikidata_id":"Q131310043","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lEHAHJkn1uMZpOV5tQ0hHg1XHav.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/dvqN7v5VrutMmVyNnSv269QEIjh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BFI Flare London LGBTQIA+ Film Festival","release_date":"2024-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
