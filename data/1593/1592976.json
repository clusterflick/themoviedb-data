Struggling to focus and sit still, Sam reveals how his love for music and all things practical was neglected by his parents, who eventually pushed him into theoretical subjects he can't excel in. When the counsellor suspects he has ADHD, Sam reveals that he sometimes feels all his annoying impulses could be best described as an irritating \"shadow\"; a loud, brightly-dressed version of himself who never leaves him alone. She then asks Sam to recount the day when the \"Shadow\" led him through London, prioritising trivial tasks over his assignment, ultimately leading him to not hand it in on time.","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":"/rlWHak0F5VbW8cV4yHSYQUkaywd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":282286,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ice Bear
