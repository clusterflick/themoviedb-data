Veteran journalist Aisha Sultan followed Tyra for two years, through the ups and downs of trying to home-school her children during the COVID pandemic. Tyra's family faced overwhelming odds - an 18-month absence from in-person schooling, an unexpected pregnancy, the death of her partner, and job loss. Still, Tyra remained devoted to keeping up with her children's education while still being the best parent she could. The film shows Tyra's efforts to have her children meet the same educational standards that would be expected of them during in-school learning. When the results of their evaluative tests come back, the gap between expectation and reality is revealed.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Education, Interrupted","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30092706","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
