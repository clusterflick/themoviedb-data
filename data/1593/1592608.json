We witnessed the birth of a sporting phenomenon that would leave a lasting mark on generations of climbers. But fifteen years later, in 1997, beyond the myth, where is Patrick Edlinger? Gilles Chappaz found him on some of the most beautiful walls of the Verdon Gorge and other cliffs during the filming of Maurice Rebeix's documentary \"Roc'n Wall 97,\" where he shares his climbing practice and philosophy with the younger generation, including Liv Sansoz and Arnaud Petit.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/8UEYENL4MFjSV8Opnp0NdkVPSd7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1579,"logo_path":"/otPDzB7wHCUsDH0BzKy3DQ7sTWP.png","name":"FR3","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1997-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il
