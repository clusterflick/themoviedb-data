MoYu symbolizes a rejection of rat racing, a compromise under societal pressure, an aspiration for freedom, or simply laziness.  Focusing on the delicate balance between individuals and their work, the documentary sheds light on the complexities of the Chinese work culture. Blending storytelling with striking visuals,  from scenes in The Sims 4 and authentic CCTV footage to everyday moments in modern China — Touching Fish offers a compelling lens on the complexities of Chinese work culture.  As it navigates themes of labor, fulfillment, and resistance, the film invites viewers to reflect on their own relationship with work and time. Touching Fish is not just a portrait of a social phenomenon — it's a conversation starter about what it means to live meaningfully in an age of burnout and overwork.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2025-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Touching Fish","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5855464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dayun Zhang","original_name":"Dayun Zhang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Dayun Zhang","credit_id":"6930c95162e2972532e6790d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5855468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Svenja Tong","original_name":"Svenja Tong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Svenja Tong","credit_id":"6930c97c4733f68791f24483","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5855473,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jiaying Sun","original_name":"Jiaying Sun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Jiaying Sun","credit_id":"6930c9aaa36e69b2a72ee9e8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5855475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frances Keung","original_name":"Frances Keung","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Frances Keung","credit_id":"6930c9d02d80666ccc336f49","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5855395,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yongjin Li","original_name":"Yongjin Li","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6930c480627d5895f3f5b814","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5855396,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yongjin Li","original_name":"Yongjin Li","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6930c4cc89e59c8f32e67937","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5666255,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Komiku","original_name":"Komiku","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6930c530cd0e2eedc3c1e6ad","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5855458,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Chenxuan Wang","original_name":"Chenxuan Wang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6930c8fa75cfbb34a74a3db5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
