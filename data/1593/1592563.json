Through a tapestry of compelling stories from independent small-scale farmers across the United States, from Alaskan kelp harvesters to dairy farmers in Kentucky, the film reveals the authentic, lived realities and unprecedented challenges of those working against the tide of escalating industrialization in agriculture. Featuring insights from visionary chefs and culinary experts, Fork in the Road expands the conversation beyond the farm, demonstrating how food sustainability is a shared responsibility that extends into our kitchens and communities. More than a call to environmental action, the film illuminates the vital ways that sustainable food practices can nourish our bodies, strengthen our communities, and heal the Earth.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fork in the Road","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1169787,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jonathan Nastasi","original_name":"Jonathan Nastasi","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6930d61dcb11fc7d30e679a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2637795,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vivian Sorenson","original_name":"Vivian Sorenson","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6930d64620ead5fcd4336fa3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
