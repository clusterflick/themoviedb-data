An ambitious teenager is eager to explore the world by reaching the other side of the river. He meets an indifferent and unenthusiastic ferryman. The tiny ferry is not large enough to hold dissenting opinions. The ferryman considers the teenager naive while the teenager thinks the other spineless with no stance. Reflecting on the present, their conflicts and separate beliefs make a consensus almost impossible. Two people set for sail, yet only one reaches the shore. On the other side of the river, the youngster, instead of hope, witnesses the end of an era.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/aCjk7LktrwaF1mZzimarPCwxtkL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61392,"logo_path":"/e1g54NyBA3ICLice0kKOYHMc84u.png","name":"Fresh Wave","origin_country":"HK"},{"id":61393,"logo_path":"/zBPeWCDSwQ2PDSRHacdt4HPHw3n.png","name":"Hong Kong Arts Development Council","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2015-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raging Through River","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2732132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clifford Tsang Man-Wai","original_name":"Clifford Tsang Man-Wai","popularity":0.0884,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6930e8f6aeeb9ae076336fc9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1132644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gregory Wong Chung-Yiu","original_name":"王宗堯","popularity":2.2843,"profile_path":"/1sVY6lO3ruRj2Z2hcFIgC7A9ugW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6930e900627d5895f3f5b892","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5855638,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lai Wing Cheong","original_name":"Lai Wing Cheong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6930e762e983c016202eead5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5855638,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lai Wing Cheong","original_name":"Lai Wing Cheong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6930e76c2d80666ccc336fa0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5855661,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hui Yat Hung","original_name":"Hui Yat Hung","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6930ebec68bd32c58f336fa8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5855713,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mak Ka Wai","original_name":"Mak Ka Wai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6930f609ebde8c204a336faa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5855752,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andy Chan Siu Cheung","original_name":"Andy Chan Siu Cheung","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6930fbb5d3825a29dae67990","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1124,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qWTdOd2FgwEJyyBx2p1PkChl3VG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1124,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h2nXLxPo8BKwo7kAXRTTi5MJTDQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1124,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Ak5tTP3s1zns1PlQPkkd2av2xmZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1333,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aCjk7LktrwaF1mZzimarPCwxtkL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":889}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"Fresh Wave International Short Film Festival 2015","release_date":"2015-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"《渡邊人》Raging Through River 第十二屆鮮浪潮國際短片節（本地競賽短片）","key":"vpbOVNL0Ujs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-02-13T11:54:16.000Z","id":"6930e647a994307fc3295957"}]}}}
