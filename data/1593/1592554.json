In this half-forgotten primeval world, nightmares blur into waking dread, and sinister tales of old come alive: chorts, rusalkas, nightwraiths, witches, and ancestral curses lurk just beneath the surface. As dreams curdle and reality unravels, something old and malevolent tightens its grip — drawing them ever deeper into the pitch-black abyss of Slavic horror.  What lies behind old prejudices, and what dark secrets does the past of these places hold?  Where does true evil reside — in black magic curses or in the hearts of the people around you?  The first step into the swampy quagmire has already been taken, and you will never return to how things were before.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2025-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Izvod:
