ALMA – the Atacama Large Millimeter Array – takes space observation to new heights.  Equipped with the most advanced technology astronomers can investigate the origins of the universe, the birth of solar systems and planets, mysterious dark molecular clouds, and many other astronomical enigmas.  ALMA consists of 68 enormous parabolic antennae, trapping cosmic rays in hitherto virtually unobservable long-wave range – something that is only possible here at an altitude of 5,300 metres and extremely low humidity levels.  Research results are depicted in elaborate animated sequences, creating genuine works of art out of the assembled mass of data. This will bring us closer to understanding the creation of life, the origin of the universe and the nature of infinity.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/i75BMqsASfjXMlXPxRZhABbiyyZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eyes of the Atacama","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/i75BMqsASfjXMlXPxRZhABbiyyZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
