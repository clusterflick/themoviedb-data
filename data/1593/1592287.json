The story is told through a narrator. The film is purely experimental, created without a script; the work was formed by editing together footage filmed over the years. The narrator’s voice reads a page from a diary. The experiment lies in the spontaneity with which the work was created.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AL","name":"Albania"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Albanian","iso_639_1":"sq","name":"shqip"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In search of Man.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5854400,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikolas Pipero","original_name":"Nikolas Pipero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6930583da4e0835afc8ce13c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
