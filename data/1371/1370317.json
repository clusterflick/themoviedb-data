Three men hike along the narrow paths on steep slopes above the coastline. The camera follows their steps and without words or music, the film asks about the purpose of their walk. A man's paces are counted by the tower clockwork. In the Watchman episode, the second man descends to the coast to night-watch a bankrupt factory. In Smoke, the third man sets fire to the last inhabited house in a mountain village.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/hHJjqRT77eRGGpfpBYfy82rC7RT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":241571,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vladimir Perović","origin_country":"ME"},{"id":93575,"logo_path":null,"name":"RTV BK Telecom","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":41354,"logo_path":"/3ND5Fugeqmy63tYk1WUMrroJnkz.png","name":"Radiotelevizija Crne Gore","origin_country":"ME"},{"id":11230,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zeta Film","origin_country":"ME"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CS","name":"Serbia and Montenegro"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Steps","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2525877,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vladimir Perović","original_name":"Vladimir Perović","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670adfdabbb1a9e81c61b17c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2525877,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vladimir Perović","original_name":"Vladimir Perović","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670adfe04111be4f02745dfd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2525877,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vladimir Perović","original_name":"Vladimir Perović","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670adfe74111be4f02745e03","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3621938","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hHJjqRT77eRGGpfpBYfy82rC7RT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
