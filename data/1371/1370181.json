It’s clear that this is a costume party when another man arrives dressed as a Roman, who proposes a dance to the woman on the swing. This is followed by a scene between the first woman and the man on the swing (whose name is Pierre), who were probably lovers. The film contains beautiful subjective camerawork shot from the vantage point of the swing. The title Curiosités mondiales probably has nothing to do with the film, since it comes from a leader added to the original copy. -  Emmanuelle Berthault\"","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"[CURIOSITÉS MONDIALES]","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
