Tactical amnesia is, perhaps, just another regulating strategy. But can you forget at will? Tropic Temper cracks open Singaporeâ€™s code as a site of a disciplined tropics and enters its environmental forgetting program realised via surveillant climatic infrastructures and extreme terraforming. Through the voices of Nancy, a Peranakan nyonya ghost and J.A.C.E., an omniscient intelligence of Holy Origin, the film surveys the city-country's last remaining mangroves at risk of being transformed connected e-gardens, while new energy and chemical processing islands rise out of the ocean. Within the smooth and all-sensing new nature where botanical prowess and technological spectacle collide, nymphs, attracted to the island's energy pools, visit to feed on the lingering underbelly of petrol-washed coral reefs and hollow karaoke lounges.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tropic Temper","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4995562,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elizabeth Gabrielle Lee","original_name":"Elizabeth Gabrielle Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670a457c37d86d520bb06447","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
