In this riveting account, Petropoulos details Lohse’s role in stealing countless masterpieces from prominent French and Dutch families, while evading meaningful punishment, and continuing to deal art profitably for most of the rest of his life. This explosively compelling tale calls the international art market to task for its continuing lack of regulation.","popularity":0.0479,"poster_path":"/d63zgeXo007M4ok4oOW4bFAMuZZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plunderer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1914217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugo Macgregor","original_name":"Hugo Macgregor","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670bb6143bb4557c669b8ce0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/d63zgeXo007M4ok4oOW4bFAMuZZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uRgsck9VH4CyYfOTFwAlXdeBgJ5.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":347919,"name":"nazi art theft"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Yes VOD","release_date":"2025-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
