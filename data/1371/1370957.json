Presented in its original unedited format, audiences can experience the show from the front row, as if they were there. And although recorded in 1973, the vibrant color camera-work, lighting and audio production of NBC studios appear as current as Mr. Darin's timeless appeal. The DVD also features family photographs and never-before-released home movies of Bobby with his wife Sandra Dee and their son Dodd. Seldom-seen TV footage of The Andy Williams and Flip Wilson Shows and rare Hollywood trailers of his early feature films Come September and Pressure Point are included as well as commentary about Darin's Oscar-nominated role in Captain Newman, M.D. by the film's star Gregory Peck. Plus, the interactive discography makes the DVD an invaluable source on the Darin era.","popularity":0.1511,"poster_path":"/cLVwEUretVQPKDkNeUQ8yJYnzVW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bobby Darin: Mack is Back","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobby Darin","original_name":"Bobby Darin","popularity":0.3953,"profile_path":"/2IsNBGiXSnPkxlj39zFXOknuJpu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"670c82074111be4f0274f215","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1980,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iNpOnSm6RY05jdhCD2lvNPZQt7l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3520}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cLVwEUretVQPKDkNeUQ8yJYnzVW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"DVD Release Date","release_date":"2000-07-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1973-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
