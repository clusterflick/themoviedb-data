Prince of Tyre' and maintains the original language of the text. The story takes place in a green area delimited by highways. A group of immigrants and homeless wake up at dawn. Gower starts the interpretation of the text of Shakespeare, which it will be carried out almost until the end by the same group of people living in this surreal garden of Eden. The story is the dream of the little girl Marina, who lives with his father, Pericles, who is dying, in a post-atomic society. The film is a metaphor of the crisis of the role of the father in Western Society.  When Pericles discovers the dread answer to Antioch's riddle, he flees for his life straight into famine, shipwreck, love, fatherhood, and another shipwreck; he loses his wife and daughter, and doesn't find them again until the story moves us through resurrection, attempted murder, pirates, prostitution, and divine revelation.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/423PzRbyCLnC39sAeQphlLwS4z3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pericles by Shakespeare on the Road","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3168174","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1429,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/423PzRbyCLnC39sAeQphlLwS4z3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
