Hank and Jack live this credo to the full and not just in poker. When Hank decides to run three back-to-back marathons in 24 hours, their friendship is suddenly challenged by a million dollar bet, pushing their limits both physically and emotionally. Inspired by true events, director Thomas Woschitz infuses his wonderfully bold take on the indie genre with a multi-faceted narrative that is universally relevant. When the stakes are high, you better know the odds.","popularity":0.7629,"poster_path":"/gO9j0l8MhQ1LrJp3YhlGhJSMR03.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157677,"logo_path":"/7sGQC5xG6oqw3SE9wQUYXcAxU7Y.png","name":"KGP Filmproduktion","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":242304,"logo_path":null,"name":"Uldreams Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":17731,"logo_path":"/5g3YMbcDXJKQvnYU1irjw5T8y7Z.png","name":"Freestyle Picture Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"Three back-to-back marathons in 24 hours, two gambling buddies and a one million dollar bet.
