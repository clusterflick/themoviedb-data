The documentary highlights the birth of the \"Hitchcock Touch\" at a period when talking pictures first emerged and explores his trademark themes, like such as murder, suspense and cool blondes. While focusing on Blackmail, the documentary reveals how this film also foreshadows the director's later masterpieces, from Psycho to North by Northwest and from The Birds to Frenzy.","popularity":0.7474,"poster_path":"/zPaESWatFlE1URgz1uIJ6aDm2d7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113521,"logo_path":"/f1zRNbj6hK0Fqgc9lTVU5r3O3Iw.png","name":"StudioCanal","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":182280,"logo_path":"/mlV1EG68KIbmd0IfrbA6ePEpaRD.png","name":"Nedland
