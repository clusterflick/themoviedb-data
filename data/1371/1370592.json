Seeking to understand the meaning behind traditional dance, which can be weaponized to oppress and marginalize, Hana explores the complexities of the Palestinian and Israeli relationship with the guiding belief that everyone wants and deserves peace. This lyrical and thought-provoking film is sure to engender reflection and deep conversation.","popularity":0.158,"poster_path":"/7NtY6TA51IJRg6REkInja4DV45t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":245752,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rally Cap Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everything You Have Is Yours","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5199180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hadar Ahuvia","original_name":"Hadar Ahuvia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6792aa4bd515b24f30fbf5d8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5199182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mor Mendel","original_name":"Mor Mendel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6792aa5416dce24fa8ffb808","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5199183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gil Sperling","original_name":"Gil Sperling","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6792aa60d515b24f30fbf5f7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5199184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shirly Bahar","original_name":"Shirly Bahar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6792aa6f7aed891525ea337b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3825064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lily Bo Shapiro","original_name":"Lily Bo Shapiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6792aa7c7aed891525ea337f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5199185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ze'eva Cohen","original_name":"Ze'eva Cohen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6792aa8f2930a91b6eea341c","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4997693,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tatyana Tenenbaum","original_name":"Tatyana Tenenbaum","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670bb41ab15d97b1a93c7c9b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4997693,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tatyana Tenenbaum","original_name":"Tatyana Tenenbaum","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6792aa15b9bf03c11cffb7d1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2188507,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Brighid Greene","original_name":"Brighid Greene","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/mFfCkaeSSBiWR8gJAPjmi6qFQEY.jpg","credit_id":"6792aa2a2930a91b6eea33d1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29293067","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7NtY6TA51IJRg6REkInja4DV45t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5945,"name":"zionism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jewish Film Institute WinterFest","release_date":"2025-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Everything You Have Is Yours (TRAILER)","key":"1008264572","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-09-11T01:44:09.000Z","id":"6792a9fcd515b24f30fbf5ad"}]}}}
