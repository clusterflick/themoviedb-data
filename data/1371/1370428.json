Through personal stories of the individuals behind these projects, the film highlights their passion, the social and political significance of film clubs, and their enduring role in democratizing cinema and fostering collective cultural experiences.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Film
