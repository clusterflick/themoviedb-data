Archival materials, intriguing presentations of Buckley's most mind bending audio performances, and insightful interviews with Whoopi Goldberg, Robin Williams, Jonathan Winters, Studs Terkel and many others weave together a portrait of a unique American persona. Part preacher, part hipster, Buckley sermonized on everything from hydrogen bombs to Jesus Christ. He counted both Al Capone and Laurence Olivier as fans. During his heyday, the kings and queens of comedy and jazz sat eagerly at his feet to hear the word of 'The Lord', yet he rarely if ever fill a nightclub. Lord Buckley may simply have been 'Too Hip For the Room'.","popularity":0.5806,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Too Hip for the Room: The Righteous Reign of Lord Buckley","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4422424,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michael Monteleone","original_name":"Michael Monteleone","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670b7e9a3bb4557c669b760f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52838,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Scheftel","original_name":"Jeff Scheftel","popularity":0.0763,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670b7e9ff58a9206aa40ced8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71797,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Gibney","original_name":"Alex Gibney","popularity":0.4984,"profile_path":"/kJp2tfLlg0smYgnhA8Fw5LBbRwC.jpg","credit_id":"670b7ec5b15d97b1a93c6a7a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2623776","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
