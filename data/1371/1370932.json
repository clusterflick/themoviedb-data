She has no company. She is the only pupil at the school, as well as the last child in a beautiful ancient village. Only elderly people around her as well as an archaic kind of life. Her journey from her house to the school (the school only for her) reveals the real string of motions, colors, sounds, folk customs, habits, objects, buildings, faces… all that seems to be slowly fading to disappearance. The film is a metaphor for vanishing of a nation.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/nBWmouYSf0tgXCy33obxEJzLDVa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93575,"logo_path":null,"name":"RTV BK Telecom","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CS","name":"Serbia and Montenegro"}],"release_date":"2003-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vanishing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2525877,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vladimir Perović","original_name":"Vladimir Perović","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670c628b3bb4557c669bd85b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2525877,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vladimir Perović","original_name":"Vladimir Perović","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670c62923bb4557c669bd85e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2148979,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Milan Stanić","original_name":"Milan Stanić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670c62da3bb4557c669bd86e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4998891,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dušan Milunović","original_name":"Dušan Milunović","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670c62e4f58a9206aa412f1b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4998893,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vladimir Krstić","original_name":"Vladimir Krstić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670c62f93bb4557c669bd885","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2736873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Relja Obrenović","original_name":"Relja Obrenović","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670c64bdb15d97b1a93cd037","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33981561","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nBWmouYSf0tgXCy33obxEJzLDVa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
