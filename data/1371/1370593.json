The Salmon sisters, Native Alaskans, work on the regulatory front â€“ pushing the federal EPA to block the project, and remaining hyper-vigilant to political pressures that could shift at any moment. The Strickland brothers, independent fishermen who know they could be just one mine accident away from losing their livelihood, probe closed-door meetings to expose the truth behind what the developer tells the public. Together, the Salmons and the Stricklands remind us never to quit until Goliath has fallen.","popularity":0.1385,"poster_path":"/zwtgXdAnid3RTgciYnMCxv7DQep.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":245751,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crooked Footprint Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":213016,"logo_path":null,"name":"Resilient Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unearth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2171900,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hunter Nolan","original_name":"Hunter Nolan","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670bb4a73bb4557c669b8c22","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4891580,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Auberin Strickland","original_name":"Auberin Strickland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670bb4b1f58a9206aa40e39a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4997699,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dunedin Strickland","original_name":"Dunedin Strickland","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670bb4baf58a9206aa40e3a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33826249","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zwtgXdAnid3RTgciYnMCxv7DQep.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
