It can be categorised as tourism program that is \"nature based, ecologically sustainable, where education and interpretation is a major constituent and where local people are benefited.\" The film \"Leave Nothing But Footprints\" looks to define this emerging new concept of ecotourism in the rapidly booming tourism sector in India. Set in the Himalayan region, the film studies the downside of mainstream tourism and looks at critical issues such as garbage and waste disposal while attempting to map out the new approach to tourism.
