She's hurt, angry, and believes she's the only one who can keep her mom and dad together. That night while dreaming, Skye finds she has taken her parents to court in a last-ditch attempt to deny their divorce?!?! With Jack representing the defense and Trevor sitting in as the judge, Skye attempts to prove that her parents' divorce is undesirable, unnecessary, and most importantly, totally unfair to her! What are her friends going to think? How can she live in two houses at the same time? What about holidays?  Using gentle humor, original music and a compelling storyline, Trevor Romain uses Skye's experience to give kids practical, helpful advice for dealing with the pain of divorce--such as; it's not your fault, try not taking sides, don't hide your emotions, and talking to friends can really help. After all, as Skye discovers, her parent's aren't divorcing her--they love her!","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2g3AWxJJO7Z8lwyPgenX7aYzyl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Is it all just a bad dream?","title":"Taking the \"Duh\" Out of Divorce","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.685,"height":894,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2g3AWxJJO7Z8lwyPgenX7aYzyl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":612}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
