The idea was born out of our own questions and struggles on how to deal with things that may seem out of your control.  The themes we decided to focus on were those of creativity, relationships, the pursuit of financial profit, and the many directions you can intentionally or unintentionally find yourself taking. We hope the short provides direction in helping others pursue their own creative and personal goals by hearing first hand experiences. Thank you to everyone involved for your transparency and willingness to be involved.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/uSroM67VDaJwjetMSUeGPTc0iCq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103748,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eskimo","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wonderland | A Short Form Doc on Creative Commerce","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Wonderland","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1194206,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eliot Rausch","original_name":"Eliot Rausch","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Themselves","credit_id":"670c0ccf3bb4557c669bb307","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4998380,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Terry Rayment","original_name":"Terry Rayment","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670c0be4f58a9206aa410d59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4998384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hunter H.
