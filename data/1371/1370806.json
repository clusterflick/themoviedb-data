The first instance court adjudicated his acquittal since there was lack of sufficient evidence of the murder. As the politicians and the local authorities interfere in the judgement, the prosecution requests a repeated trial before the Higher court. New evidence is found and the Higher court sentenced Uhernik to prison. His wife Ana is accused of taking part in the crime as well. During eight years of imprisonment the family falls apart: the wife passes away, the eight and twelve years old children are left to other people. The locals talk about a presumable killer and indicate a possibility of somebody else's involvement in the crime.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/967GWSeQzolY2JE33SYjAy57tIK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124991,"logo_path":null,"name":"Casablanca","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":92608,"logo_path":null,"name":"Quasar Multimedia","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":28367,"logo_path":"/kw6n8hNwQXQSPlGdwVZvmbO0Haq.png","name":"RTV Slovenija","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fatal Error","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4998467,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandi Bradač","original_name":"Sandi Bradač","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Martin Uhernik","credit_id":"670c199bbbb1a9e81c623dad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4998468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vanja Lukšič","original_name":"Vanja Lukšič","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ana Uhernik","credit_id":"670c19a9b15d97b1a93cb321","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4998469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Uhernik","original_name":"Martin Uhernik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"670c19b637d86d520bb10f3c","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1919247,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boris Jurjaševič","original_name":"Boris Jurjaševič","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670c196037d86d520bb10f1a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4998466,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Zdenko Kodrič","original_name":"Zdenko Kodrič","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670c196dbbb1a9e81c623d93","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6410844","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/967GWSeQzolY2JE33SYjAy57tIK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
