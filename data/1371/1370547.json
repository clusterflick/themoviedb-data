You see and hear your friends and relatives come to you with their revelations, demands and grief, whilst you are unable to move or talk. Will your secrets be safe or compromised before it's all over? Who is the woman whose anguish is replaced by an acceptance that she can live without you?

Ultimately, you may know your name, but do you know who you really
