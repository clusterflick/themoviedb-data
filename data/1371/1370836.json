We speak to Duncan who led the fight to overturn the ban; Ann who served during and after the ban was lifted; and Danny and Cole who both served after the ban was lifted. This collaboration was between filmmaker David Graham, the National Museum of the Royal Navy and the Royal Navy LGBTQ+ Network. The National Museum of the Royal Navy commissioned the film.","popularity":0.1027,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Generations of LGBTQ+ Pride in the Royal Navy","title":"Uncharted Waters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4998578,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Mark Graham","original_name":"David Mark Graham","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670c3025f58a9206aa411e83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":162365,"name":"military"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Iris Prize LGBTQ+ Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
