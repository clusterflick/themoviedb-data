In the dead of winter in the mountain valley of Missoula, Montana, Doris has just returned to the U.S. after years teaching English abroad. At the local university, she forms a small community with her class of international students. But outside she is alienated, unable to form meaningful connections. Doris explores the town, coming across clues to a recent legacy of displaced persons: an old photograph of an Indian camp, a row of Japanese graves in the local cemetery. And she is haunted by a strange encounter with a boy, who lives in a motel on the edge of town. As winter begins to thaw, she and her students must consider the complexities of adapting and belonging. What if home is no longer a place, but just an idea? Could you lose yourself completely? The next decision they make will redefine not only their lives, but their very identities.","popularity":0.0764,"poster_path":"/sVvAiJvGJ5SPBPbLjPyxgX00UdB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bella Vista","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285551,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathleen Wise","original_name":"Kathleen Wise","popularity":0.0884,"profile_path":"/us0USicAXKpA3TU90Sc7Rzp1QWY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Doris","credit_id":"52fe4f4dc3a36847f82cc02d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285552,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hiroka Matsushima","original_name":"Hiroka Matsushima","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Yuri","credit_id":"52fe4f4dc3a36847f82cc031","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285205,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vera Brunner-Sung","original_name":"Vera Brunner-Sung","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4f4dc3a36847f82cc029","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2734006","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.647,"height":1728,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sVvAiJvGJ5SPBPbLjPyxgX00UdB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1118}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
