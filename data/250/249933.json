After the Cuban Revolution, it was conﬁscated by the State and became a shelter for homeless people. Located in Old Havana, today it is an imposing ruin. Jorge de los Rios, a retired clerk, is one of the few residents who remain there, along with La Flaca, his lover, and Waldo, a young itinerant. As the rest leave for safer places, Jorge clings to his dilapidated home and its buried treasures, slowly digging his way through its debris. The film speaks poignantly to a lost generation who fought in the Cuban Revolution and dreamed of a better society.","popularity":0.0661,"poster_path":"/rKgBr9ZqgUGp8vJyk5iOuPaBwu0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10140,"logo_path":null,"name":"Producciones de la 5ta Avenida","origin_country":"CU"},{"id":54807,"logo_path":"/wPlbPNfmSepRTBluu2geueypJsV.png","name":"El Viaje Films","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2014-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hotel Nueva Isla","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivian Pacheco","original_name":"Vivian Pacheco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"55ba979892514119cb003bb2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josefina Patterson","original_name":"Josefina Patterson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"55ba97a4c3a3684afb004fcd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jorge de Los Ríos Vega","original_name":"Jorge de Los Ríos Vega","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"55ba97acc3a36869b400450c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Waldo Muñoz Hernández","original_name":"Waldo Muñoz Hernández","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"55ba97b792514123e7004e9d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1285223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irene Gutiérrez Torres","original_name":"Irene Gutiérrez Torres","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4f4dc3a36847f82cc103","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1685486,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Javier Labrador Deulofeu","original_name":"Javier Labrador Deulofeu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57ea83e5c3a3687809000949","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1685486,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Javier Labrador Deulofeu","original_name":"Javier Labrador Deulofeu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57eaa826c3a3687850001bc9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1277117,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"José Ángel Alayón Dévora","original_name":"José Ángel Alayón Dévora","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57eaa8eb925141109300b83e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1685486,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Javier Labrador Deulofeu","original_name":"Javier Labrador Deulofeu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57eaa86692514114b5001b8e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1285223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irene Gutiérrez Torres","original_name":"Irene Gutiérrez Torres","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57eaa8569251413748003699","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2851090","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lD3iorCGmIm2VruTmncIqZzjUyF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1347,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rKgBr9ZqgUGp8vJyk5iOuPaBwu0.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":898},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1347,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1O1bFKQUKGrNL8pIeh0hJ7eV4c5.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":898}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":701,"name":"cuba"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Hotel Nueva Isla - Trailer (Doc Fortnight 2015)","key":"PzZfB40LoDg","published_at":"2015-02-09T14:24:52.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"55ba9995c3a36869b4004554"}]}}}
