In a jam session, in the late composer's house in Inhaúma, a neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro, a group of friends get together to play his music while a \"feijoada\" (typical Brazilian food with black beans)is being cooked in the kitchen. The samba-players, first-rate samba stars themselves, remember Ketti's great hits in a homage to the man who was best known as \"a voz do morro\" (\"the hill's voice\" - but hill as a metaphor for a place where poor people build their shacks in slums, in opposition to city, where middle-class people live in Rio). Among the guests, names of the traditional \"samba-school\" Portela and ex-partners. Also, the presence of a black hat on an empty chair, represents the composer himself, who died in 1999, after a life of many accomplishments in music, and appearance in three of Dos Santos's films: \"Rio, 40 Graus\", \"Rio Zona Norte\" and \"Boca de Ouro\".","popularity":0.1474,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":76566,"logo_path":null,"name":"Regina
