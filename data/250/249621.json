The events are set between 2160 and 2025 BC. When the peasant Khun-anup and his donkey stumble upon the lands of the noble Rensi, the peasant’s goods are confiscated and he’s unjustly accused of theft. The peasant petitions Rensi who is so taken by the peasant’s eloquence that he report his astonishing discovery to the king. The king realises the peasant has been wronged but delays judgement so as to he can hear more of his eloquence. The peasant makes a total of nine petitions until finally, his goods are returned.","popularity":0.1231,"poster_path":"/5jzM9IOzPhPzTZk1S44nsyI9ln5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","name":"Egypt"}],"release_date":"1970-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Eloquent Peasant","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","title":"Shakawi el Falah el Fasih","type":"Original"},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"能言善辩的农民","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"EG","title":"El-Fallâh el-fasîh","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1198687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ahmed Marei","original_name":"Ahmed Marei","popularity":0.1437,"profile_path":"/iIIXM5SpwiJfDNOynT2RSMW3BHe.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Peasant","credit_id":"54fc54d992514122be001e67","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1436685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ahmad Anan","original_name":"Ahmad Anan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/pPaNiD0AhsBFND788N8ztXetPmp.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Grand Steward","credit_id":"54fc54cac3a36869cf004b05","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1198688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ahmed Hegazi","original_name":"Ahmed Hegazi","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/pkV4bHSqiKDZfA8Lwbvx27CWY28.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Thutenakht","credit_id":"54fc54d1c3a36816380012ce","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1198686,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shadi Abdel Salam","original_name":"Shadi Abdel Salam","popularity":0.1168,"profile_path":"/sb4zh7RzN0nRSCynnlKDBJarKUR.jpg","credit_id":"537fba360e0a26588c001530","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1198686,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shadi Abdel Salam","original_name":"Shadi Abdel Salam","popularity":0.1168,"profile_path":"/sb4zh7RzN0nRSCynnlKDBJarKUR.jpg","credit_id":"652f4a5d358da75b5d006e8b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1574794,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Salah Marei","original_name":"Salah Marei","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/7VYPMt0dLZthtxpvOeUA7wuscBn.jpg","credit_id":"5f98c6124f5801003706b7a6","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2833201,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mustafa Imam","original_name":"Mustafa Imam","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f98c605719aeb00385f7782","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1620541,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kamal Abul Ela","original_name":"Kamal Abul Ela","popularity":0.0809,"profile_path":"/mlhLjcKkMOYBIp2lxdALjV2yv88.jpg","credit_id":"5f98c60b77e1f600368b0edd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1650898,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gamil Soliman","original_name":"Gamil Soliman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f98c5ca2b531d00387b08f6","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1649321","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8ywQolUZQbrQJ4dcgglbpeJ0Aff.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/60vajm8Img2lqCFvVvGNAgyw9T2.jpg","vote_average":1.222,"vote_count":3,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5jzM9IOzPhPzTZk1S44nsyI9ln5.jpg","vote_average":10,"vote_count":7,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"ar","file_path":"/af3d2D6NjZGOAxL8FED3e3ENu7t.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":6,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":"ar","file_path":"/A8xarZAS0L3un3ZxssqeB795dlg.jpg","vote_average":1.444,"vote_count":9,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/olyPEXabOAGVwM2fRxp1rXa45p9.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":3,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zB1r5aSRZJ3DAs3q8PtjXkNm9gj.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"1970-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
