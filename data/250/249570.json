But underneath it can also be read in many ways. It is a cinema that is invented on the spur of the moment, like you invent an instrument to play music and then abandon it. This film came out like an improvisation, a total risk. It is a deconstruction of meaning but not in the analytical, intellectual sense. I have always tried to lose myself with my films. There is no trace of American or French underground cinema. If anything, it is the idea of home movies, there were many ideas for digital films long before digital film existed. This film made itself, it was like a jazz improvisation. Amor Louco is a lost object, it doesn't speak any language, it has no signs, no letters, no captions. And in the scene where the cataract is cut with the razor blade, it was the adventure of the film itself that was put to the test\".","popularity":0.1728,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":100386,"logo_path":null,"name":"Julio Bressane Produções Cinematográficas","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crazy Love","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":571936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guará Rodrigues","original_name":"Guará Rodrigues","popularity":0.1014,"profile_path":"/k3EUGQtBGe2vm2ReKQAHKEEsy5v.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4f46c3a36847f82ca2af","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1284861,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rosa Dias","original_name":"Rosa Dias","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4f46c3a36847f82ca2b3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1398984,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joca","original_name":"Joca","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"548d7dd892514122f9004267","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1398985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luiz Pelé Mendes","original_name":"Luiz Pelé Mendes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"548d7de692514122fc003bdc","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Júlio Bressane","original_name":"Júlio Bressane","popularity":0.2473,"profile_path":"/jSFn17yLBKwcwQrk0qn7nhkwT66.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4f46c3a36847f82ca2a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Júlio Bressane","original_name":"Júlio Bressane","popularity":0.2473,"profile_path":"/jSFn17yLBKwcwQrk0qn7nhkwT66.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4f46c3a36847f82ca2ab","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1656330,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gilberto Macedo","original_name":"Gilberto Macedo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a9d20be267de012ea2db98","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Júlio Bressane","original_name":"Júlio Bressane","popularity":0.2473,"profile_path":"/jSFn17yLBKwcwQrk0qn7nhkwT66.jpg","credit_id":"65a9d211d9542000c62118cc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3815934,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Laurie Gane","original_name":"Laurie Gane","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a9d200e267de0138a2daf2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Júlio Bressane","original_name":"Júlio Bressane","popularity":0.2473,"profile_path":"/jSFn17yLBKwcwQrk0qn7nhkwT66.jpg","credit_id":"65a9d216d9542000c62118d1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0181961","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
