But the mainstream media hardly reflects this. Nero´s Guests is a story about India’s agrarian crisis and the growing inequality seen through the work of the Rural Affairs Editor of Hindu newspaper, P Sainath. Through sustained coverage of the farm crisis, Sainath and his colleagues created the national agenda, compelling a government in denial to take notice and act. Through his writings and lectures, Sainath makes us confront the India we don’t want to see, and provokes us to think about who ‘Nero’s Guests’ are in today’s world.","popularity":0.195,"poster_path":"/xvOSmzNG0hqNtArSaQdHJLeGGWM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5975,"logo_path":"/vvjgoKygWWYZvYyidT3RmOCq5If.png","name":"YLE","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7079,"logo_path":"/m4er9bvkoHHgELav4HPgMDlq3MP.png","name":"Oktober","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":19382,"logo_path":null,"name":"Steps India","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2009-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"},{"english_name":"Marathi","iso_639_1":"mr","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nero's Guests","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4102323,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deepa Bhatia","original_name":"Deepa Bhatia","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6481322fe2726000c92eebe3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1756640","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h8FHfsUdxpbr5oZZ944f1tN2uQy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xvOSmzNG0hqNtArSaQdHJLeGGWM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5888,"name":"agriculture"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
