They find themselves in the heart of old Paris on a square in Montmartre. While the father tries in vain to seduce passers-by with his mime skills, his son, out of compassion, takes his place by dancing with gestures close to break-dancing. The public is won over. Finally, an incident makes them meet a singer who will allow them to perform on stage during an innovative show, mixing mime, singing and break-dancing.","popularity":0.2816,"poster_path":"/dHJkZGNKka1Sk1KjmiUCXVWxV7O.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":214129,"logo_path":"/ijF9Qwzjprt0l5PpjPdQrwNwxdm.png","name":"Digital Drug","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2012-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kill the Roach - L'art du geste","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1284445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Regis Truchy","original_name":"Regis Truchy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4f3dc3a36847f82c7c9f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1284446,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eudes Toussaint","original_name":"Eudes Toussaint","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4f3dc3a36847f82c7ca3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1284447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leïla Chateau","original_name":"Leïla Chateau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4f3dc3a36847f82c7ca7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1284448,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolas Haudelaine","original_name":"Nicolas Haudelaine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/hi173X7lb7LKNnXTZFk0IxRvv8i.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4f3dc3a36847f82c7cab","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1284449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luc Schwarz","original_name":"Luc Schwarz","popularity":0.0825,"profile_path":"/gV6BmWQ73rNEInfbMd4GJgIYku6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4f3dc3a36847f82c7caf","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3243821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hammy Dimaria","original_name":"Hammy Dimaria","popularity":0.0473,"profile_path":"/znO7gDwGsk4mRXnr3bvZiljL2p9.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"655e1bea7f2d4a012ce340ee","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1284450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dov Ellia","original_name":"Dov Ellia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4f3dc3a36847f82c7cb5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2665624","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zYWHwiYCTebph5qDMAupPevqc6e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dHJkZGNKka1Sk1KjmiUCXVWxV7O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1974,"name":"breakdance"},{"id":240462,"name":"musical comedy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
