Military governor Makram Khouri tries to flush out some fugitive PLO activists by hanging the rotting, stinking carcass of a dead donkey in a village square. Israeli doctor Rami Danon forgets his animosity towards the PLO and, out of compassion, cuts the carcass down. For disobeying Khouri's orders, Danon becomes as much a fugitive as the Palestinians. While in hiding, Danon befriends Arab hermit Tuncel Kurtiz, whose adopted son is a member of the PLO.","popularity":0.42,"poster_path":"/cW9VDnbRTKRv6fuZrMRxLSNpMTQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101585,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dotan/Aroch Film Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"1986-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Smile of the Lamb","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Hiuch HaGdi","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Hiuh hagdi","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tuncel Kurtiz","original_name":"Tuncel Kurtiz","popularity":1.082,"profile_path":"/eivpNBNEzUhtq1l8EDlZIlPuBnj.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Hilmi","credit_id":"5a994dc00e0a2605c6008a24","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":20444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rami Danon","original_name":"Rami Danon","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Dr. UriLaniado","credit_id":"5a994dc892514128420086f6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Makram J.
