Our meeting took place on the terrace of the Hotel Majestic, in the midst of excitement of the Cannes festival life, a few days after the screening of Nel Regno di Napoli and in the presence of the photographer Jean-Claude Moireau.  Vivre à Naples et mourir is the audio capture of that informal meeting that happened on 20 May 1978 and which is, as per director's wish, more like a casual conversation than an interview in the strict sense of the term (a set of questions and answers).","popularity":0.152,"poster_path":"/6a2Ec7CalZyItGDFztJRX90TZsG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98737,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Amis de Cinématon","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":100597,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Archives de l’Art Cinématonique","origin_country":""},{"id":98738,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Fondation Gérard Courant","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2011-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vivre à Naples Et Mourir","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45192,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Werner Schroeter","original_name":"Werner Schroeter","popularity":0.464,"profile_path":"/rLOcMEdwo30tGk7Qpx3QS676isI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5c0f4513c3a368252a0db423","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1811633,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jean-Claude Moireau","original_name":"Jean-Claude Moireau","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/3EgyWkvbSonpKMMxkO9ft2vR8cL.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5c0f451ec3a368252d0da761","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1306694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gérard Courant","original_name":"Gérard Courant","popularity":0.2808,"profile_path":"/sWWqc9jfwBAwVoqmyditTyfPBB3.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5c0f4527c3a36825180d7b42","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1306694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gérard Courant","original_name":"Gérard Courant","popularity":0.2808,"profile_path":"/sWWqc9jfwBAwVoqmyditTyfPBB3.jpg","credit_id":"533d37e4c3a36878ed002df6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1306694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gérard Courant","original_name":"Gérard Courant","popularity":0.2808,"profile_path":"/sWWqc9jfwBAwVoqmyditTyfPBB3.jpg","credit_id":"5c0f4544c3a36825180d7b54","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1306694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gérard Courant","original_name":"Gérard Courant","popularity":0.2808,"profile_path":"/sWWqc9jfwBAwVoqmyditTyfPBB3.jpg","credit_id":"5c0f4586c3a36825230cd789","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1306694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gérard Courant","original_name":"Gérard Courant","popularity":0.2808,"profile_path":"/sWWqc9jfwBAwVoqmyditTyfPBB3.jpg","credit_id":"5c0f458ec3a368252a0db854","department":"Crew","job":"Special Effects"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Xcrboox3KPnJjav5tozNDGhneP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6a2Ec7CalZyItGDFztJRX90TZsG.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Centre Pompidou, Paris","release_date":"2011-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
