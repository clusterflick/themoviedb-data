The streak was snapped at Pittsburgh in week 8 and in the game, New England lost for the season perennial Pro Bowl corner back Ty Law. With Troy Brown playing receiver and defensive back, New England would win all but one of their remaining games to complete one of the most dominating runs of all time.
