It is a lush green place near a river, containing over-sized mushrooms, living plants, and friendly woodland animals.  Shortly after their arrival in the pleasant Agapeland, Stevie and Nancy discover the Marvelous Music Machine, which Stevie explains is a \"quanamatic digilator.\" Stevie tries to make it work, but only succeeds in causing it to produce a loud noise, which shoves him back into the Music Machine's caretaker (possibly creator), The Conductor.","popularity":0.5247,"poster_path":"/4iHvt8pSZF0xldztQXYGeIf3ZNZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19371,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bridgestone
