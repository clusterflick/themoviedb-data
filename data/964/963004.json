It is the last day of school; the summer vacations are beginning. Moreover, France has just voted for change. The Vercrest family is in turmoil. Richard Vercrest, the father runs an insurance company. Suzie, his daughter is eighteen years old. In general, the relationship between them is excellent. But Suzie is in crisis: she wants to \"escape the system\". To begin with, she wants to drop out of school and find a job. Richard reacts badly to the unexpected decisions of this girl, who until then had been \"gifted\". He freaks out and she breaks down.
