The first, \"Il Viaggio\" (\"The Journey\"), is taken from Francis Scott Fitzgerald's diaries, and shows the adventures of a writer traveling between America, Africa and Europe. The second episode, \"Estrellita Va a New York\" (\"Estrellita Goes to New York\"), is inspired by a comics story by Carlos Ceesepe, and tells the escape to the United States of little Estrellita and her friend Katia who, helped by Pablo Picasso, try to escape from Paris occupied by the Nazis. The third segment, \"Due Dongiovanni\", is an original subject by Mario Martone and Giorgio Barberio Corsetti, freely inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's movie Saboteur (1942). The three episodes are linked together by an original musical motif composed by the Panoramics which returns in all the stories, but with different arrangements.","popularity":0.1483,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Perfidi incanti","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mario Martone","original_name":"Mario Martone","popularity":0.176,"profile_path":"/Aa9hYSoeabZaKqV1r8DgF3kMiC0.jpg","credit_id":"6259d50edff66e0098a5d234","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mario Martone","original_name":"Mario Martone","popularity":0.176,"profile_path":"/Aa9hYSoeabZaKqV1r8DgF3kMiC0.jpg","credit_id":"625ac9b5d38b58009c489702","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0427652","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
