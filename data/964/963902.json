No lamentation or reproaches, the characters of the film do not complain, they are lucid. Through voice but also through music, poetry, dances and clay-based creations, they tell the fragility of every moment, couples who love each other, drought, the owner, dreams, culture, animals, the future for children, the price of things, money, and the earth.","popularity":0.2611,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Romances de terre et d'eau","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":409525,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Pierre Duret","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Duret","popularity":0.0953,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625c143b229ae219c92544f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56209,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Pierre Dardenne","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Dardenne","popularity":0.1735,"profile_path":"/n5BqsP6h3VtweQAFfQz2qtd5khq.jpg","credit_id":"625c147ca284eb009be64827","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45138,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luc Dardenne","original_name":"Luc Dardenne","popularity":0.2116,"profile_path":"/hfnvLjmLKQyx1ftkuC6hhHwoTtM.jpg","credit_id":"625c1469a284eb0067146c95","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1076795,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrea Santana","original_name":"Andrea Santana","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625c1443d38b5817af917dd6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0329551","wikidata_id":"Q3441010","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
