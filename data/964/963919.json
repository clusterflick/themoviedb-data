This bold plan, designed to turn around a nation on the brink of collapse, where unemployment was at an all-time high and the working poor were suffering from the precariousness of the job market, was intended to give hope to a country that had been battered before anything else. Once he came to power, the new president from the Democratic Party immediately passed some fifteen laws designed to revive the economy.","popularity":0.4157,"poster_path":"/ztcexe4LFRWDYMiQG2uvTDHoQjV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76921,"logo_path":"/dkPpGhEL2uQ5bmNDAqSZRFp894g.png","name":"Les Films d'Ici","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":792,"logo_path":"/cRhBQP1FFNugNxKkO1pUgeD2Rkr.png","name":"RTBF","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/qpFsGoa96SytbWkhtkkpllu5Cch.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The New Deal: The Man Who Changed America","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1508589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stéphanie Fatout","original_name":"Stéphanie Fatout","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":"/jDQkfoeHadajSQjlfe4sxNzlQVN.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"625c2fd4d266a200516d7e26","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2116047,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julia Bracher","original_name":"Julia Bracher","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"625c324068ff70009a481629","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Gabriel Nordmann","original_name":"Jean-Gabriel Nordmann","popularity":0.0823,"profile_path":"/z13B7jdk8xTC1pM67H1HjhLW06D.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"625c324b13af5f1591fbf209","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":999791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruno Paviot","original_name":"Bruno Paviot","popularity":0.3797,"profile_path":"/pGVf8YttW85MdqPfFjVKliOaS7e.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"625c32539408ec11f73ee006","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franklin D.
