Mixing family archives, life diaries and interviews she gave at the age of 91, the film becomes the creative biography of the author of La Pergola de las Flores, her most famous work, and opens the door to the social and political issues she narrated in her theater, the utopias that could not be and the conflicts that are still ongoing in Latin America.","popularity":0.3166,"poster_path":"/2SAwWtW5TbTbz7s3wLFxR1uM3l4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":173487,"logo_path":null,"name":"InteriorDIA","origin_country":""},{"id":173488,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ovo","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2012-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Isidora","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1040960,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudia
