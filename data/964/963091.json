Sometimes we choose the virtual space in order to escape reality, but in the end it turns out to be just a way to avoid the real game, our everyday life. We see the big changes as new levels in our lives and we don't have the option to skip, our only choice is to play. So, the \"Call of Pink\" comes with the positive point of view that the world needs to overcome the real life levels, which we all know are the hardest to pass. Anyway, some details as creativity and fun are the things we should keep as weapons for the reality.","popularity":0.0416,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Call of Pink","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13065166","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
