Chengdu environmentalist Tan Zuoren and local volunteers were still  rushing from one collapsed school to the next, trying to find out why they had  collapsed. Autumn went and winter came, Tan Zuoren and Xie Yihui had visited  ten counties and cities and over eighty towns and townships in the main  disaster region, covering a distance of about 3,000km. They managed to release  an investigate report on the internet before the 1st anniversary of the May 12  Earthquake. This is the first investigative report conducted by independent  citizens on the collapsed schools.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/srQ9MC1PagFg8uEZW4KHhNHTuXN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Investigation by Citizens","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1961158,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ai Xiaoming","original_name":"Ai Xiaoming","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634e03cdc9044c007d2f10d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":1082,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/srQ9MC1PagFg8uEZW4KHhNHTuXN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":760}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"第七屆社會運動電影節","release_date":"2010-01-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
