There is Obede, accused of killing children and whose request for forgiveness is just a cynical strategy to be released. There is Gahutu, who has \"no remorse\" and who in front of his judges, always speaks of \"snake\" to talk about those who were exterminated. Finally, there is Fran√ßois, forced to kill his own brother in order to survive and who is now trying to reconcile with his sister-in-law. Through these three stories, the film weaves a portrait of a society at war with the ever-present ideology of genocide.","popularity":0.4057,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rwanda, les collines parlent","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":150026,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernard Bellefroid","original_name":"Bernard Bellefroid","popularity":0.0489,"profile_path":"/p9x4NrYS6N6RRE87bByJafYwvkO.jpg","credit_id":"625c12ae9661fc00a5392a89","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":150026,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernard Bellefroid","original_name":"Bernard Bellefroid","popularity":0.0489,"profile_path":"/p9x4NrYS6N6RRE87bByJafYwvkO.jpg","credit_id":"625c12b913af5f1591fb5afa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45138,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luc Dardenne","original_name":"Luc Dardenne","popularity":0.2116,"profile_path":"/hfnvLjmLKQyx1ftkuC6hhHwoTtM.jpg","credit_id":"625c12cfdd731b0067064239","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56209,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Pierre Dardenne","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Dardenne","popularity":0.1735,"profile_path":"/n5BqsP6h3VtweQAFfQz2qtd5khq.jpg","credit_id":"625c12d713af5f1591fb5b5d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0851464","wikidata_id":"Q3453717","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
