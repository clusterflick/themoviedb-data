De Barth Breslin, refuses to sanction the marriage. Heartbroken, Ted takes up drinking and gambling with \"Poker\" LeMoyne and Don Jackson, while Ellen attends a finishing school hoping to improve herself. While trying to elude her chaperone, Ellen unwittingly dashes into a man's hotel room, and from the window, she witnesses Don and \"Poker\" playing cards, while Ted lies unconscious from too much drink. When the two gamblers quarrel, Don kills \"Poker,\" but Ted is accused of the crime.","popularity":0.3308,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1307,"logo_path":"/z6FFp0gxKiB2KLS9n3fC8uX6ZcR.png","name":"Triangle Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marked Cards","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margery Wilson","original_name":"Margery Wilson","popularity":0.1192,"profile_path":"/lEcSh2qIB3tldz7wNPKU8qd87MS.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ellen Shannon","credit_id":"6259997a69eb90009ba6e206","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wallace MacDonald","original_name":"Wallace MacDonald","popularity":0.357,"profile_path":"/lP3Lxz5EiWYhziMJedbkuzeaQeE.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ted Breslin","credit_id":"6259998874d6c01b6fc48a0d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1307855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Curtis","original_name":"Jack Curtis","popularity":0.0813,"profile_path":"/huntTbXIEl8GPyFkM3FJ6LB96wY.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Pat Shannon","credit_id":"62599996e55937009f0644bf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1323079,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Godfrey","original_name":"Ray Godfrey","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Janet Breslin","credit_id":"625999a4d236e60066ae3cfc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harvey Clark","original_name":"Harvey Clark","popularity":0.1355,"profile_path":"/mRxpnLg6ybAnFCoEOu3sK6b8hMV.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"'Poker' LeMoyne","credit_id":"625999b2fe6c18009f13ecd8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1312690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Bennett","original_name":"Joseph Bennett","popularity":0.0537,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Don Jackson","credit_id":"625999c774d6c01b71087a18","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Langdon","original_name":"Lillian Langdon","popularity":0.099,"profile_path":"/kOtKzUcdm9SChzXxyj29DfxGMQY.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Mrs. J.
