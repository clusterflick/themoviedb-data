Their originality consists in using the ‘invisible theatre’ method in order to surprise the public and thus make it react itself to its own problems. This documentary shows how a local theatre company efficiently uses fiction to problematise today’s African reality. This film presents two performances, one criticises the current proliferation of religious sects, the other deals with the awakening of villagers towards AIDS. Ymako, in Bambara, means ‘our concerns’.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ymako","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3508666,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurent Van Lancker","original_name":"Laurent Van Lancker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625a2fd75e120012c4bd4e89","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1097498,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Shuffield","original_name":"Robin Shuffield","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625a2ff5d236e60066b175c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
