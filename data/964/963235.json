On Broadway, Wiletta Mayer, a talented black actress, begins rehearsals for a new play about racism – written and directed by two white men.  When Wiletta finds that her arguments to tell the truth of the story are dismissed, she decides to take action.  First staged over 60 years ago, Trouble in Mind is widely considered the masterpiece of actress and playwright Alice Childress - a wry and radical satire of racism in theatre.","popularity":0.3763,"poster_path":"/9EDrvEIv2pLoh4ZuXqffyi3jruv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16355,"logo_path":"/tWuPpLrD2urqKPXIit4VLTHWvgK.png","name":"National
