Following the workers’ revolt against the rise of prices violently repressed by the communist power, a group of opponents create the KOR (Workers’ Defense Committee). Heir to the currents of opposition to the Communist regime since the end of World War II, sponsored by intellectual and moral personalities who had been standing up against social injustices since the Twenties, the KOR tries to break the information monopoly of the State and to set up an autonomous labor organization.The action of the KOR leads in 1980 to the birth of Solidarnosc, first independent trade union of Eastern Europe.Three members of the KOR remember and tell us the story of a victory against communist power in Europe.","popularity":0.0722,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"K.O.R.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1391364,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joanna Grudzinska","original_name":"Joanna Grudzinska","popularity":0.0484,"profile_path":"/oiSdVKeRStmOaIXs6iYHvj7qDzG.jpg","credit_id":"625c1568229ae219c9254a15","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56209,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Pierre Dardenne","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Dardenne","popularity":0.1735,"profile_path":"/n5BqsP6h3VtweQAFfQz2qtd5khq.jpg","credit_id":"625c1583d266a2009c0030f7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1391364,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joanna Grudzinska","original_name":"Joanna Grudzinska","popularity":0.0484,"profile_path":"/oiSdVKeRStmOaIXs6iYHvj7qDzG.jpg","credit_id":"625c1564a284eb0067147081","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45138,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luc Dardenne","original_name":"Luc Dardenne","popularity":0.2116,"profile_path":"/hfnvLjmLKQyx1ftkuC6hhHwoTtM.jpg","credit_id":"625c1579ae36680050ddde97","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1653880","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
