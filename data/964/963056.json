In the morning he goes to a preschool in Riga, Latvia where he sings, draws, learns to read and plays. In the afternoon he is already a first grader, logging in the Zoom class in a New York public school. While most of the world is worried that school closures and remote learning during the pandemic has left kids without education, the pandemic has given Vilis a chance to study in two schools at once. Vilis’ mom has been documenting these weird times on her phone. The experience in both schools will be challenged when Vilis starts the first grade this fall for the second time in his hometown.","popularity":0.0525,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":63249,"logo_path":null,"name":"VFS Films","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2022-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In 2 Times","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3507896,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zane Ozoliņa","original_name":"Zane Ozoliņa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6259a7c2d55c3d0050321044","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3507896,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zane Ozoliņa","original_name":"Zane Ozoliņa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6259a7e30cb335004f2da7b1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3507900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maija Kalniņa","original_name":"Maija Kalniņa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6259a7fea0f1a200a8c621fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2904982,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jānis Šēnbergs","original_name":"Jānis Šēnbergs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6259a83cdff66e006735d184","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1007606,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Uldis Cekulis","original_name":"Uldis Cekulis","popularity":0.0831,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6259a8a3d55c3d009e6725fa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2964962,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Roberts Brežģis","original_name":"Roberts Brežģis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6259a8783acd2016291d7d85","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1777839,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Artis Dukaļskis","original_name":"Artis Dukaļskis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6259a85decaef515fe5a44d5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3507900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maija Kalniņa","original_name":"Maija Kalniņa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6259a80a71f09500506dd1f2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3507900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maija Kalniņa","original_name":"Maija Kalniņa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6259a81bfe6c18009f144b1f","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263237,"name":"covid-19"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
