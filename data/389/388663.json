He spent very few years living in Tel Aviv, but he loved the city dearly. Some 100,000 people attended his funeral in 1934. “King of the Jews” is a portrait of the most beloved Jew of his day, Chaim Nachman Bialik. Combining special animation, a voice track by Chaim Topol, rare archival footage, long-forgotten photographs, poems by Bialik performed by Ninet and interviews with the foremost Bialik researchers and fans in Israel and around the world, this film retells the story of the little boy from the shtetl, who became King of the Jews.","popularity":0.2666,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":22230,"logo_path":null,"name":"Avi Chai Foundation","origin_country":""},{"id":29725,"logo_path":"/6PJrEn8WR7RQzbwv6vGoEvxg6Dh.png","name":"Hot","origin_country":"IL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2014-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bialik - King of the Jews","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Bialik Melech Hayehudim.","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Topol","original_name":"Topol","popularity":0.3141,"profile_path":"/Ah6ZOrg9AmeqPU04qUGF5eon2Fv.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Hayim Nahman Bialik","credit_id":"56f036ff925141183500054f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1577452,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yair Qedar","original_name":"Yair Qedar","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f03416c3a368717700046e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1593884,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Jewboy","original_name":"Jewboy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f0343892514118440004ea","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1593886,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Philip Bellaish","original_name":"Philip Bellaish","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f0347e925141184a0004dd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1577452,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yair Qedar","original_name":"Yair Qedar","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f03451c3a3687177000472","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1593885,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ayala Bengad","original_name":"Ayala Bengad","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f0347392514118350004e3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":118410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ninet Tayeb","original_name":"Ninet Tayeb","popularity":0.1601,"profile_path":"/prUHQmu14m8LEKJ7pKqHuQ9HQGf.jpg","credit_id":"56f034c9c3a36871820004fd","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":930630,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rachel Leah Jones","original_name":"Rachel Leah Jones","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f0346692514147d800005b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1577452,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yair Qedar","original_name":"Yair Qedar","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f0344a92514118440004ee","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":51088,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aviv Aldema","original_name":"Aviv Aldema","popularity":0.0941,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f034aa9251411841000502","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3782874","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":536,"name":"israel"},{"id":223743,"name":"bialik"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"2014-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
