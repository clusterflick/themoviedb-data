Ice cream drips from its cone, a father photographs his child. Then a man suddenly arrests his focus. Inspired by a picture from photographer Juan Medina, taken on the beach of Gran Tarajal in Spain in 2006, director Ronny Trocker animates a situation that happened today as it did yesterday, with the difference that today, no one moves. Time is frozen. A black man lies exhausted on the shore. It seems that no one has noticed his arrival.","popularity":0.1596,"poster_path":"/zAadvMOYK0KELOuhEf4eE5thoqn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81068,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stempel Films","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":12434,"logo_path":"/9rfMaAC5f84cCmmVmYv29nGkdY1.png","name":"Autour de Minuit","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Summer","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1592899,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Umaru Jibirin","original_name":"Umaru Jibirin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"56ed484ec3a3682259005f3d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1532456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giacomo Abbruzzese","original_name":"Giacomo Abbruzzese","popularity":0.1104,"profile_path":"/8L5uwJdzmGgHu8vxrJPZj5DMz2p.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64040011136545008ce95745","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1185850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ronny Trocker","original_name":"Ronny Trocker","popularity":0.0331,"profile_path":"/xL12Evz8lp9D4OFimhCGcf8knPl.jpg","credit_id":"56ed482492514143fc0064ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1163955,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Artur Castro Freire","original_name":"Artur Castro Freire","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57cd4c0a925141794c000fcb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1185850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ronny Trocker","original_name":"Ronny Trocker","popularity":0.0331,"profile_path":"/xL12Evz8lp9D4OFimhCGcf8knPl.jpg","credit_id":"57cd4bfb92514179d5000f2f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5559278","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1688,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1zBXQwvFRddYLSLEe7aS4zzZnvq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zAadvMOYK0KELOuhEf4eE5thoqn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qW3W1ibqiwiHJHXnddpsogscU3J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":966,"name":"beach"},{"id":1900,"name":"immigration"},{"id":2173,"name":"illegal immigration"},{"id":13088,"name":"summer"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlin International Film Festival","release_date":"2016-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
