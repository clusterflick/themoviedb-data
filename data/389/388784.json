He works hard to organize traditional cultural events, such as outdoor performances of the traditional play I Chrissomalloussa, in order to solidify local values and a sense of identity. The teacher is aided by a young woman, a widow who has just returned from Germany and lives with her father-in-law. Kazan walks away with the film, as his sinister desires for his daughter-in-law are inflamed when he sees that she has fallen in love with the teacher. These developments lead him to whip up protests against the play by conservative locals, claiming that the teacher has changed the traditional story by adding elements of propaganda with the potential of causing peasant uprisings. The result is an unexpectedly violent example of social censorship.","popularity":0.1319,"poster_path":"/1weQZX81KEh94eOJh0Ga8IiumEp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Girl with Golden Hair","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Chrissomaloussa","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1120002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vera Krouska","original_name":"Βέρα Κρούσκα","popularity":0.1606,"profile_path":"/nRhfq9bxDSd2QdwtRlsG6Ibkhnq.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"62d45c2b5aba32004f8e43a1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vangelis Kazan","original_name":"Βαγγέλης Καζάν","popularity":0.1782,"profile_path":"/zR5FQcd8Hxx4KpaUp3AbZ6lJvmU.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"62d45c4604b59600541301d4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2210472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonis Katsaris","original_name":"Αντώνης Κατσαρής","popularity":0.1536,"profile_path":"/pWhJPp4BtEtTPsPwt9BxGx9mgbm.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"62d45cb02dffd80061fb4fdc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1489251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikos Alevras","original_name":"Νίκος Αλευράς","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"62d45c6e1f3e60004b8fb8ac","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2466022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dina Botoni","original_name":"Ντίνα Μποτώνη","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"62d45c8ff1759c006e004db0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1330406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vasilis Laggos","original_name":"Βασίλης Λάγκος","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"62d45cc1f1759c004cf1b2f9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1300629,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frieda Liappa","original_name":"Φρίντα Λιάππα","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/pcqgjbFRbMRUlW3g96psb6pUVxS.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"62d45cca2ea6b90057a23e13","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1372736,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adonis Lykouresis","original_name":"Τώνης Λυκουρέσης","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"62d45cd623bcf40067bcb2a4","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1372736,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adonis Lykouresis","original_name":"Τώνης Λυκουρέσης","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d45bf304b596004cf6949b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1372736,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adonis Lykouresis","original_name":"Τώνης Λυκουρέσης","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d45bebe6d3cc00509584dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1593496,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Lycouressis","original_name":"Tony Lycouressis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d45bfafa40460071114216","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590790,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andreas Bellis","original_name":"Andreas Bellis","popularity":0.0524,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d45c14e93e950067b0d0ff","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1867021,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stratis Karras","original_name":"Στρατής Καρράς","popularity":0.2563,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d45c0323bcf4004ca630ac","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1593496,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Lycouressis","original_name":"Tony Lycouressis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56ef26ff92514108e2000a6f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0123110","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"el","file_path":"/1weQZX81KEh94eOJh0Ga8IiumEp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"","release_date":"1978-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
