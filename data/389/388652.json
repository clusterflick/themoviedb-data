The last three, still teenagers, lend a summery and easy-going tone to the film, which is magnificently framed by Eugène Green’s long-time cameraman, Raphael O’Byrne. The dialogue that settles in between the younger members and those in their thirties has a rare quality, as if the difference of language – which each has had to impose on their family or on their national entourage – had almost tacitly created a secret community. Starting with the political stakes (regional languages versus centralism), the story hikes over the mountains with these new friends brought together by the filmmaker.","popularity":0.0789,"poster_path":"/yjLlVojxg6dei8Bs2i0TKBhyiVC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":49103,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films de l'Air","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Basque","iso_639_1":"eu","name":"euskera"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Faire la parole","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eugène Green","original_name":"Eugène Green","popularity":0.1124,"profile_path":"/tJQ75frWlLxGXffqW1aDVSTEa1N.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5a0716d892514113fa014f76","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eugène Green","original_name":"Eugène Green","popularity":0.1124,"profile_path":"/tJQ75frWlLxGXffqW1aDVSTEa1N.jpg","credit_id":"56ee89389251412b33003663","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5539396","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eJ8crkp97x9Z4ZiO8d5HFnwaoKl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p3Fh1UuPfcvNwXKfugUOk6De28q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fzqMJEkRNzc29N0yxeWG7nJKELC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/doiTh2LoR912XBwRF5v0EYtpes9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1023,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/yjLlVojxg6dei8Bs2i0TKBhyiVC.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":723}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
