Gas-station owner Gerhard Zehmann is saddled with cheating wife Regina Bill. The man would like to escape to Venezuela, but he can't unload his wife. Then he meets a woman who is the exact double of his wife (also played by Regina Bill, of course). Falling in love with this clone, the husband hatches a plan. He'll murder his wife, then leave for Venezuela with her look-alike so as not to arouse suspicion. Are foolproof plans like these ever really foolproof?","popularity":0.2402,"poster_path":"/xfNcC1oZNrPKj1YqkRBcIZfxw7t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18857,"logo_path":null,"name":"Neue Studio
