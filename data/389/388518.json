Eventually, the girl (on the advice of friends) turns the tables on him, and claims to have outside relationships of her own. This prompts him to move out in a huff, into the flat of a casual conquest of his, but he soon discovers that his poor manners have resulted in his not being welcome anywhere.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sleepy Betrayers","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1276846,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beat Lottaz","original_name":"Beat Lottaz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56ed8ef2c3a368226000782a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0122267","wikidata_id":"Q64157677","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
