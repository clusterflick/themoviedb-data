The quiet Armand settles into Montreal after his wife has left him and before long, he continues the momentum when an ill-considered liaison with a nubile woman ends on her insistence. Next, Armand gives his heart to a frustrated housewife, though this decision is hardly well thought out. In the meantime, a gay man who rents out a room in his apartment has unfulfilled longings directed at the unsuspecting handyman. L'Homme a Tout Faire won a Silver Medal for \"Best Picture\" at the 1980 San Sebastian Film Festival.","popularity":0.3831,"poster_path":"/tcWKMhnCAJRAUVJONxe1jqk5Ros.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1980-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Handyman","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1293475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jocelyn Bérubé","original_name":"Jocelyn Bérubé","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/2dpX2H7r5p5fkxLO5mvs1UQKCtu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"56ef19f392514108e20008d0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1156290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrée Pelletier","original_name":"Andrée Pelletier","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":"/pdcHs3krADENjK8LPGFBu6nyUvc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"56ef1a0ac3a368224e00c39f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81467,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gilles Renaud","original_name":"Gilles Renaud","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":"/lQprp6pM0i3xxA8MIG9OjkDlnS0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"56ef1a159251412b33004df6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":545222,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janette Bertrand","original_name":"Janette Bertrand","popularity":0.3673,"profile_path":"/69Vw3kBwZ44VsJymiOtwKvqkh9S.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"56ef1a24c3a368226000c851","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":558456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danielle Schneider","original_name":"Danielle Schneider","popularity":0.0853,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Manon Lachapelle","credit_id":"5fa9cc9541465c0040c43012","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":534894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Micheline Lanctôt","original_name":"Micheline Lanctôt","popularity":0.3043,"profile_path":"/rQVRzBU3cZRRsjbNK43CfNtv608.jpg","credit_id":"56ef19b2c3a368226000c847","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0080886","wikidata_id":"Q3203828","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.663,"height":1508,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/tcWKMhnCAJRAUVJONxe1jqk5Ros.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-03-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
