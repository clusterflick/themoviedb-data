In 'The Regina Monologues', when Bart finds $1000, Lisa is able to convince him to take the family on vacation and they choose to visit England. In '30 Minutes Over Tokyo', after learning how to save money on everything, the Simpson family manages to make it to Tokyo. In 'Blame It On Lisa', when Lisa sheepishly admits that she's been making long-distance calls to Brazil in aid of an orphan she's sponsoring, the whole family decides to head to Rio for a visit. Finally, in 'Simpsons Safari', tired of constant mistreatment, the bag boys of Springfield go on strike, creating a grocery shortage. Homer's frantic search for food in the house uncovers lost gold in the attic which he uses to take the family on safari in Africa.","popularity":0.0764,"poster_path":"/rPmitGda2OTpKaoZdOzTShFbF8w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Simpsons: Around the World in 80 D'Ohs","video":true,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":786,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rPmitGda2OTpKaoZdOzTShFbF8w.jpg","vote_average":5.238,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"6","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2007-03-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
