Alone, Viktor (Sven Wolter) heads off for his usual summer vacation to some islands where he can ostensibly look for antiques for his wife's shop in Stockholm. His marriage is a failure or worse -- he raped his wife before he left home, and he is obsessed by erotic imaginings. Once on the islands, he makes friends with a little girl whose mother is mentally disturbed and is kept by her husband in a locked room. The islanders are as tight-lipped as Viktor, and any communication is stiff and artificial. Viktor's own alienation begins to slip as he takes surprising, violent action to turn around the imprisoned mother's life -- but it does not work, nothing seems to work -- and his last actions indicate that he may not be willing to simply give up.","popularity":0.7094,"poster_path":"/t0ruINSMbRVfDFdKOyteAvVwGDp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17538,"logo_path":"/jj2wM3UJIcKjDLlfahYnG8qLl8V.png","name":"MovieMakers","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":2302,"logo_path":"/rPXEdpqwFycAY9ZgrAJXv13qcWW.png","name":"Svenska
