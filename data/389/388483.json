The Deliverance of Comfort is a critical and densely-layered response to the belief in child witches in some parts of rural Nigeria and Africa. The film questions the very nature of belief and comments on the complex relationship between pre-Christian pagan belief and modern day Nigerian Christianity. The relationship between Exu, The Devil, the human spirit and God.  Inspired by the low-fi special effects employed in Nigerian Nollywood films especially when the supernatural is being evoked, \"The Deliverance of Comfort\" uses these same techniques but challenges the conservative and unchanging ideas about the supernatural drawing uncomfortable conclusions. In essence using Nollywood to subvert Nollywood.","popularity":0.1943,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":72563,"logo_path":null,"name":"ZSW Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NG","name":"Nigeria"}],"release_date":"2010-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Deliverance of Comfort","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1592990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Onome Sansom","original_name":"Onome Sansom","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Comfort","credit_id":"56ed65c0c3a3682256006f8e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1339704,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zina Saro-Wiwa","original_name":"Zina Saro-Wiwa","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56ed657ec3a36822590063f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":616,"name":"witch"},{"id":11001,"name":"religion"},{"id":179572,"name":"nigerian cinema"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-03-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
