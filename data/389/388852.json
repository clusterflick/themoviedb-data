Throughout the same period, they often had to seek asylum in other countries. This movie concerns Sergei (Roger Jendly), a revolutionary who kills a student in Russia and flees to Switzerland. Though he has the gifts and abilities to unify various revolutionary groups within Russia, once he has been forced to flee, they have no interest in him. When his presence in Switzerland threatens a trade agreement with the Tsar, he is tracked down and expelled.","popularity":0.0975,"poster_path":"/bKfrKqWNHkHsjeUBwsiZn42CaAT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95902,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinov
