The boss, particularly, thinks long hair on men is dirty. When they refuse to cut their hair, he finds an excuse to fire them. The meaning of long hair is felt particularly deeply for one fellow, a painter, who, when he succumbs to his fathers' pleas that he cut his hair, turns his paintings to the wall and burns himself to death.","popularity":0.1079,"poster_path":"/6ZJOJ7pjesPEaHXGX3tgi20tApJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50989,"logo_path":null,"name":"R.O.C.","origin_country":""},{"id":17914,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paris-Cannes Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1975-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The $2 Haircut","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":263072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Didier Sauvegrain","original_name":"Didier Sauvegrain","popularity":0.1174,"profile_path":"/nNa7bKmzeYfDsF2zwPcIo1UsvdZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"André Lalande","credit_id":"56ef8421c3a368225100e423","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":236554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roselyne Vuillaume","original_name":"Roselyne Vuillaume","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/bfoOl97mZD9bZ3I9J3eHXH93oxy.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Léone","credit_id":"56ef8428c3a368226e00e20b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alain Noël","original_name":"Alain Noël","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"André's friend","credit_id":"56ef8444c3a368226500d427","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1468986,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Pierre Frescaline","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Frescaline","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"André's friend","credit_id":"56ef8452c3a368225600dcb0","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544423,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philippe Condroyer","original_name":"Philippe Condroyer","popularity":0.122,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56ef8340c3a368225600dc81","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0196474","wikidata_id":"Q3207866","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6ZJOJ7pjesPEaHXGX3tgi20tApJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"West Germany","release_date":"1976-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cannes Film Festival","release_date":"1974-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
