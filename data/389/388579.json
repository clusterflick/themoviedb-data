Young miscreants have run amok in our country. Despite efforts to \"scare them straight\" hooligans prevail. Vandalism! Underage Drinking! Premarital Sex! Godless Heavy Metal! Drugs!

Not for the squeamish, we have exposed the end result of the bacchanal lives of privileged excess our \"children\" enjoy. Time to face the music, kiddos!
