Some places remind people, as if that were still necessary, that it is still possible to have fun, to let oneself go in one’s life. Sometimes this play loses its balance between being carefree or being irresponsible. You often find, between a laser beam and the sound of techno music, the shadow of youth disgusted with life... Or longing for love. Most of them are between 16 and 20 years old, called Nadège, Ludovic, Stéphanie, Guillaume or \"Gasoil\", they each dream in turn of \"their\" Saturday evening, the one they’ve imagined, the one they’ve arranged. Far from the noise of the town, they create their memories in two radically different places. Some will go to \"Vibration\", the fashionable night club, crammed full every weekend. The others will meet at \"Top Club\", an old-fashioned dance-floor now becoming very rare in the country.","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":11359,"logo_path":"/aqWJRi66t2oMPMmC60CdK9I3WQd.png","name":"France 2","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1995-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un samedi soir en province","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2899856,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Michel Destang","original_name":"Jean-Michel Destang","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fdda705eb0932003f4f2038","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13908878","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"France 2","release_date":"1995-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
