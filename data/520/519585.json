They are excited about the city and its legendary nightlife. As they unpack their things at the hostel, Oisín finds an envelope with money from his father in his pocket. Later, at their concert, everything seems to be going well - the boys are in a good mood, the audience is going along - when Oisín suddenly freaks out in the middle of the stage. The anger at his father for abandoning the family and the pain over his mother's death overwhelm him and he throws himself into Berlin's nightlife alone. When he meets the young, pretty Berliner Sabine (Aylin Tezel) and she shows him places far away from the party and tourist hotspots, he seems to find support with her.","popularity":0.389,"poster_path":"/5gdBGjdDfgqEFXNbDgGuBLrsohy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2018-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost
