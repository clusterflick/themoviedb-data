How did life begin? What is time? What is consciousness? How much do we really know?  By introducing researchers from diverse backgrounds for the first time, then dropping them into new, immersive field work they previously hadn’t tackled, the film pushes the boundaries of how science storytelling is approached. What emerges is a deeply human trip to the foundations of discovery and a powerful reminder that the unanswered questions are the most crucial ones to pose.  Directed by Emmy-nominated and Peabody Award-winning filmmaker Ian Cheney and advised by world-renowned filmmaker Werner Herzog, The Most Unknown is an ambitious look at a side of science never before shown on screen.","popularity":0.7498,"poster_path":"/kTzgxB70rE21XKCBIBTvhg9wHVG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17209,"logo_path":"/khOQX3iJuSmaFWrL3w4LijbtnJZ.png","name":"VICE Media","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Most Unknown","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":44,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"As Maiores Incógnitas","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229459,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Cheney","original_name":"Ian Cheney","popularity":0.0879,"profile_path":"/9FAPlcviXcoAG1xPeVrJReDpaIZ.jpg","credit_id":"5adb862f9251410acd00f899","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1190482,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Eduardo Mariota","original_name":"Eduardo Mariota","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/iykr3b69e6Vkkshv8kvQVhiQH1N.jpg","credit_id":"672ac719424cc6a3be2e41ab","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1251447,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Taylor Krauss","original_name":"Taylor Krauss","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672ac740cc1d12827d0c771a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4108249,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Michael James Murray","original_name":"Michael James Murray","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672ac74e425bdcd2ace34a9f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1169828,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Emily Topper","original_name":"Emily Topper","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672ac75fde546585d04d8505","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8126390","wikidata_id":"Q56055001","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fj6ssdXesl2rsEKshTnNOG1XTBY.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8yevXuquijFceq4ppdpHuQBUhOv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8IfYeA5OEkdJhAqh0aAXhnJ3VGe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/swPFi1KkboFmCPGZfTUs3maUfIF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kGB12GFYikSCY038HzoDm8v1xZo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":5.218,"height":243,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mFmRTkiRkz2ZMPaZ4xAmCW4hshB.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1268}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2460,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kTzgxB70rE21XKCBIBTvhg9wHVG.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1640},{"aspect_ratio":0.658,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uVK08fBUjEHUwxJRUGnqFO5upRv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":658},{"aspect_ratio":0.658,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9gZk3lL5PGSGwkkF49GgCWeb6rn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":658},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2700,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wppiCrbba2yr9AMc5buvd3pK41V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15174,"name":"ecology"},{"id":18330,"name":"nature"},{"id":287067,"name":"science"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Most Unknown (Official Documentary Trailer)","key":"VtUaZk3_Njk","published_at":"2018-03-01T18:08:06.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5adb860f0e0a26144200fe3b"}]}}}
