Crime, lack of opportunity and infrastructure problems still persist. Community Patrol explores neighborhood self-policing through the eyes of Minister Malik Shabazz, a long-time Detroit activist and community organizer. Determined that more black men don’t end up in jail or killed, the minister confronts drug offenders directly rather than reporting them to the police.","popularity":0.5242,"poster_path":"/9uBeqJ6vuHyyZLlYQEfjXaKgQr9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134936,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beachfire Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Community Patrol","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2662769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Minister Malik Shabazz","original_name":"Minister Malik Shabazz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ee39f125b4fed001e629eb7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":207957,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew James","original_name":"Andrew James","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee39f4d4e6742002053162a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":207957,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew James","original_name":"Andrew James","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee39f2f97eab4001de1460a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":207957,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew James","original_name":"Andrew James","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee39f3b4e6742001e5346e8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2522841,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sara Archambault","original_name":"Sara Archambault","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee3a063197de4001f90a413","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2662758,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Katie Tibaldi","original_name":"Katie Tibaldi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee3a0775b4fed0021633dc9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2066575,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Patrick Janssen","original_name":"Patrick Janssen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee3a04a197de400218fd09e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2662797,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jolyn Schleiffarth","original_name":"Jolyn Schleiffarth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee3a086d20c8700213092f9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2662754,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"SHIGETO","original_name":"SHIGETO","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee39f6bd20c8700213091d8","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7486402","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9uBeqJ6vuHyyZLlYQEfjXaKgQr9.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6149,"name":"police"},{"id":2355,"name":"american dream"},{"id":5890,"name":"community"},{"id":5060,"name":"patrol"},{"id":11550,"name":"black activist"},{"id":12425,"name":"racism"},{"id":159930,"name":"inequality"},{"id":233840,"name":"black lives matter"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Festival Premiere (Big Sky Documentary Film Festival)","release_date":"2018-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Online Premiere (The Atlantic)","release_date":"2019-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"COMMUNITY PATROL - Official Trailer","key":"327479326","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-03-30T19:22:39.000Z","id":"5ee3a2895900860021515659"}]}}}
