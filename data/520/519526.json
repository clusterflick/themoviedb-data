A magnificent turquoise lake in between rough, steep cliff surrounds the small village. But the lake hasn’t been always there. One day, an enormous landslide blocked a river. In a few months, this river turned into a huge lake, which is now up to 30km long. Thousands of homes and fields were flooded. Entire villages disappeared forever. Thousands of people got dislocated and had to look for different places where to live. What is left are the stories of those that once used to live there which are passed on from generation to generation.","popularity":0.1026,"poster_path":"/1wPEQA2VKhrD0hEXlYtUpqQE9WC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103604,"logo_path":null,"name":"National College of Arts Lahore","origin_country":""},{"id":665,"logo_path":"/bUomMJoEX2W7XpgvNeWswCFKzrW.png","name":"Hochschule für Fernsehen und Film München","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"PK","name":"Pakistan"}],"release_date":"2019-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Absence of Apricots","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1300562,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Asadi Faezi","original_name":"Daniel Asadi Faezi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/x7jSfVVK9ZNmaXUoybJMnZSkcM5.jpg","credit_id":"5ada81700e0a261436000d96","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1300562,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Asadi Faezi","original_name":"Daniel Asadi Faezi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/x7jSfVVK9ZNmaXUoybJMnZSkcM5.jpg","credit_id":"5ada8163c3a36862ca000e32","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8381736","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iZ6dJJ6HzbWDckQGf8PaJr5gayJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":534},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/omOKm92bdWAxYtIphsOBVaOi8ul.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1wPEQA2VKhrD0hEXlYtUpqQE9WC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"67.
