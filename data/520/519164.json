Riccardo Muti, music director of La Scala at the time of this performance, gives full weight to the alternation of social realism and private amatory psychology, of crowds and intimacy, body and spirit. And the director of this Milan production, the famous Italian film director Liliana Cavani, provides it with a realistic setting. Every scene looks like a genre painting, from which Puccini’s psychograms emerge musically. This forms the background for the two outstanding singer actors, who take the lead roles.","popularity":0.2872,"poster_path":"/oNRnTLRqs2eM2NrUqyKS9ktFKgn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79627,"logo_path":null,"name":"TDK","origin_country":""},{"id":26664,"logo_path":"/tmdslqWvUZVJoSmVD142vpD6845.png","name":"Teatro
