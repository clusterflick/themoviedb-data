He comes face to face with his alter ego, who is transformed, melts and changes into a rainbow before morphing into a lake. Long Hair Hobo is wonderstruck at the sight of this magnificent visual feast intercut with images of fields and greenspace, in what is a masterful integration of the real and virtual. An eloquent testimony to the impossibility of an unchanging identity, this work reveals the uncertainty and instability that accompany human beings throughout their lives.","popularity":0.0782,"poster_path":"/enKgRbgODdZa5rir5KvmAp5JgvF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ready, Able","title":"Forest","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":964570,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Grizzly Bear","original_name":"Grizzly Bear","popularity":0.0522,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f3903202842000698dc96f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1426158,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allison Schulnik","original_name":"Allison Schulnik","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/2RLHWXfQbmeBUxZK0nlIsIYLGCv.jpg","credit_id":"5ad8f5000e0a26372f0026bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bI80Y87YGvQJCviyPOYjfcBOJim.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/enKgRbgODdZa5rir5KvmAp5JgvF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1365}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Grizzly Bear - Ready, Able [Official Music Video]","key":"Puph1hejMQE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2009-11-05T14:41:48.000Z","id":"61f3909d028f140097c4d49c"}]}}}
