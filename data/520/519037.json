It tells the story of Elsie Mae Begay, whose history in pictures reveals an incredible and ongoing struggle for environmental justice. A powerful new epilogue (produced in 2008) shows how the film and Groundswell Educational Films outreach campaign create news and rally supporters including Congressman Henry Waxman (D-CA). The Chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform mandated a clean-up plan by the five agencies responsible for uranium contamination. Ironically, the US EPA's Comprehensive Five-Year Plan did not include Ms. Begay's backyard, until she travelled with this film to Washington, DC and screened it on Capitol Hill in September, 2008.","popularity":0.061,"poster_path":"/rW6ndsbo9DgBGgYVw4S7K4AiQKu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Navajo","iso_639_1":"nv","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Return of Navajo Boy","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3907069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorenzo Begay","original_name":"Lorenzo Begay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"narrator","credit_id":"63dfc27e8741c40087151db7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3907111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elsie Mae Cly Begay","original_name":"Elsie Mae Cly Begay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63dfc64b8741c40087151fd9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1812741,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bill Kennedy","original_name":"Bill Kennedy","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63dfc714ce5d8200aa7ab049","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3907119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Wayne Cly","original_name":"John Wayne Cly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63dfc728cd204600c30b184f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2058387,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Spitz","original_name":"Jeff Spitz","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63dfcf2e9974ee0b6b762a5a","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3907181,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bennie Klain","original_name":"Bennie Klain","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63dfcf51373ac2007f01d26b","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2058387,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Spitz","original_name":"Jeff Spitz","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b16f2c60e0a262ddf01c4f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8085496","wikidata_id":"Q7760418","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2667,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rW6ndsbo9DgBGgYVw4S7K4AiQKu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1755,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1SQyoBuIPD4nwKwAzF2SBwAa5JO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1170}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"The Return of Navajo Boy\" Documentary Trailer","key":"f8qScCWLdgo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2009-11-06T22:14:43.000Z","id":"63dfc1ef373ac2007c20597b"}]}}}
