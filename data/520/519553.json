Given its geographical situation, it is a place that opens wide the doors of imagination. A Girl from Ouessant is an invented and, at the same time very documented, cartography of the island. This methodical statement starts as the diary of Éléonore Saintagnan, the resident artist-filmmaker at the Créac’h semaphore station, an ideal site for observing the surrounding area. Then, the account shifts towards a playful mise en scène, peopled with sailors’ wives, kelp burners, stories of little black sheep or countless shipwrecks… Drawing on the regional archives filmed in black and white dating from a time when the island lived mainly from fishing, the game begins.","popularity":0.0536,"poster_path":"/ps3ov6Jt5gdvJF6QIG4JV8bnUd9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87031,"logo_path":"/lXqLNf7ttr1AIchNgDh27ueMsPf.png","name":"Michigan Films","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Girl from Ouessant","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2026932,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Éléonore Saintagnan","original_name":"Éléonore Saintagnan","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":"/oHPWfcfWg8u24mgYSeWmAr4ZpWE.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Barba","credit_id":"5ae06403c3a3683dcf011979","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2026935,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ann Stouvenel","original_name":"Ann Stouvenel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Anne","credit_id":"5ae06416c3a3683dd50105cd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1588318,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grégoire Motte","original_name":"Grégoire Motte","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Saint-Roch","credit_id":"5ae064390e0a261569013065","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2026935,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ann Stouvenel","original_name":"Ann Stouvenel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ada915ac3a36862d6001d3a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188408,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Olga Rozenblum","original_name":"Olga Rozenblum","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ada91eb9251410ad0001f09","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2026932,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Éléonore Saintagnan","original_name":"Éléonore Saintagnan","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":"/oHPWfcfWg8u24mgYSeWmAr4ZpWE.jpg","credit_id":"5ada910fc3a36862c4001f64","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1588318,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grégoire Motte","original_name":"Grégoire Motte","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae03384925141107200de06","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2029552,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Frédéric Dupont","original_name":"Frédéric Dupont","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae033c5925141107200de32","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2026932,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Éléonore Saintagnan","original_name":"Éléonore Saintagnan","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":"/oHPWfcfWg8u24mgYSeWmAr4ZpWE.jpg","credit_id":"5ae033b3925141106200d303","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ps3ov6Jt5gdvJF6QIG4JV8bnUd9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1684,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v7OSZNYjmYMDnJ5tui47EEXQeKn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1191}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
