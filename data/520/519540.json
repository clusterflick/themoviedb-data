The polish city of Bialystok is the birthplace of Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof a Polish medical doctor, inventor, and writer mostly known for creating Esperanto in 1873 while still in school, a constructed language that he believed could be a universal tool to help bridge the gap between different languages. But Bialystok is also the birthplace of David Abelevich Kaufman, known worldwide as Dziga Vertov, one of the most important cinema theorist ever, Soviet pioneer, revolutionary filmmaker, documentary, and newsreel director. The city is also the place where anarchistic communes were organized during the Russian Revolution and where the Nazis build a ghetto for Jews.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/l2wApBUpFpdoyvwQ9raK5XfOVrv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Remapping the Origins","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1406436,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johannes Gierlinger","original_name":"Johannes Gierlinger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/ahP8IF80BCTvJx9Z1HL2Hit5It5.jpg","credit_id":"5ada85fa0e0a26143c00134b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l2wApBUpFpdoyvwQ9raK5XfOVrv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
