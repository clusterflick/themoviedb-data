He would retain a strong impression of his encounter with the highly organised local workers, whose “equalitarian relationships and independent thought” he would praise in his diary. 140 years after the “conversion” of this man who was to theorise libertarian communism a little later on, Cyril Schäublin restages fragments of this diary read in Russian, in the current setting. A place in which his ancestors, who worked from generation to generation in the watchmaking manufactures of this region until their closure, still survive.","popularity":0.0547,"poster_path":"/xzC6LCpoZnkYcy4Hb7j9bvGp3KK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103602,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seeland Filmproduktion GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2018-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kropotkin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1855522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cyril Schäublin","original_name":"Cyril Schäublin","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/g8A4ScAVmClCXcFvq5SoaCpBq3t.jpg","credit_id":"5ada65600e0a267729000061","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1855522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cyril Schäublin","original_name":"Cyril Schäublin","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/g8A4ScAVmClCXcFvq5SoaCpBq3t.jpg","credit_id":"5ada653d9251416dca000046","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2026822,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Linda Vogel","original_name":"Linda Vogel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ada656d0e0a26773e00007d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8376688","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1950,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xzC6LCpoZnkYcy4Hb7j9bvGp3KK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1300}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
