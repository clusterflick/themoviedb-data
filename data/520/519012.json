(A Love Story)","overview":"'Sad! A Love Story' is a feature currently being written by Avital Ash. It follows a happy couple whose relationship falls apart when Donald Trump becomes president.  The dramedy is as much an exploration of the lingering effects of sexual assault as it is a darkly comedic look at DUT (Dating Under Trump).  Avital Ash wrote & directed this short as a chemistry test and to prove to Amir Blumenfeld that he is also a good dramatic actor. Andrew Mueller shot and voices the 'director'.","popularity":0.3735,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Donald Trump's winning the election ruins a couple's sex life.","title":"Sad!
