Chess is a game that is surrounded in mystique and intrigue, and where its champions are hailed as society's brightest and most intelligent. Through wars, chess has both been spread and adopted by the conquerors, each empire influencing the game and being influenced by it, whilst attaching it to bold symbolism. For Harun Al Rashid’s empire, chess reflected the teachings of Islam and its emphasis on intellect over luck. For the mighty Queen Isabella of Spain, co-sponsor of Christopher Columbus’ voyage that discovered America, the game evolved to reflect her ruthless power. For the U.S.A. and Soviet Union, the Championship between Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky became a proxy battle in the midst of the Cold War.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/gLzbBsgxm28sBQguQwvfOMcWUow.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Through the Golden Ages: The History of Chess","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2027261,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shamir Allibhai","original_name":"Shamir Allibhai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5adb76660e0a26144500ec7f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3756034","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/gLzbBsgxm28sBQguQwvfOMcWUow.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/1DvZK9KaSgjBNJ8O5z3vfOajyyH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
