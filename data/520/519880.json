Join Ken as he walks you through his career from his early magic act and student assemblies to comedy club routines, sold out stadium events, and a theatrical feature film release.  This DVD is a compilation of some of Ken's legendary routines including the barf bag routine, his newspaper routine, and his classic ski routine. In addition, you will see ancient clips from the very early years of Ken's life—family photos and performances in Denver comedy clubs.  You’ll be stunned as you watch a shirtless Ken prance across the stage dressed like the genie in the movie Aladdin. This scene alone is worth the price of the entire DVD!
