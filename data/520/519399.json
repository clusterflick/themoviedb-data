Growing up, my sisters and I heard voices, saw lights and dreamed of other beings. My mother and I shared a recurring dream of strangers on the driveway, where stonewalls marked the old main road through town. Our dreams and our memories converged into one experience, the experience of living in a haunted house. After the sale of the property in 2001, my recurring dreams returned and the question emerged - were we the ones now haunting the house? When I ask my father about the past, he answers with the Theory of Relativity, the Laws of Thermodynamics, and the speed of light. He dreams of being on a distant star, with a telescope powerful enough to show him how things used to be. Just as we perceive the moon, as it was 1.2 seconds ago and the sun, as it existed 8 minutes ago, great distances allow us an opportunity to look back in time.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/lpokAWSeaac1xs0yEjxAFFnMvge.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quiet Title","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2026454,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alina Taalman","original_name":"Alina Taalman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad9af49c3a3683c71007d12","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4726278","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1090,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lpokAWSeaac1xs0yEjxAFFnMvge.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":727},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1090,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6ldRBg7nfEUezv0zmEPduMbfHgs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":727}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"At Spectre Arts","release_date":"2015-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
