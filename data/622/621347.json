In this context of expropriation, Gedalia feels free to build his home and to try to fulfil his dream: a simple life, in harmony with God, outside the laws and duties of society. Life is but a dream is the story of the daily life of a settler's family, between contradictions, radical choices, difficulties, needs, and possible fears.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/scasM0UlgIb4VBacEVhbGxPmrhb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"2018-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life Is But a Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2380767,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margherita Pescetti","original_name":"Margherita Pescetti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4a63081b72945472a8eee4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2380767,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margherita Pescetti","original_name":"Margherita Pescetti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4a630f1b72945472a8eeef","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9105848","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2u1Air8PIwHh35e3wacXFTrbOFi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/scasM0UlgIb4VBacEVhbGxPmrhb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival dei Popoli","release_date":"2018-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Krakow Film Festival","release_date":"2019-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"On The Edge East International Film Festival","release_date":"2019-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"LIFE IS BUT A DREAM trailer","key":"1Jva8s2mbz0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-10-17T14:03:39.000Z","id":"5d4a63873e01ea0012cb9252"}]}}}
