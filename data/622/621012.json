Blood on the concrete floor and the sound of violence off-screen. The back of a blonde torso flicks in and out of view, smacking down methodically. Neither the sound heard nor the body shown can be attached to a gender, and the viewer is even unsure which limbs belong to which bodies. There are long pauses where the screen goes dark and only the sounds of grunts and impact can be heard. A fight scene without the fight: just sounds, flickering images of limbs and hair.","popularity":0.1062,"poster_path":"/dtjsKV1jhqsXL3sJJz0vdmScLLq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121603,"logo_path":null,"name":"Producciones Indecentes","origin_country":""},{"id":48089,"logo_path":"/vJjQD0IIdGukQft4uK73wlJLby.png","name":"Escac Films","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2007-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Love Lost","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":81160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Belén Fabra","original_name":"Belén Fabra","popularity":0.6087,"profile_path":"/jMpbVLPzbniRx6GBHz3CMdEGEIl.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5d48df352d1e405db5c1c657","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2379943,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robin Blesa","original_name":"Robin Blesa","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5d48df422d1e400199c11663","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2379944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miguel de Molina","original_name":"Miguel de Molina","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5d48df502d1e40192cbe14e8","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2018090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lola Clavo","original_name":"Lola Clavo","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d48de24a0be2841a3a18465","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2379937,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Elodie Leuthould","original_name":"Elodie Leuthould","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d48de762d1e405082c1c7cd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2379936,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Helena Matamala","original_name":"Helena Matamala","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d48de3f2d1e40192cbe1251","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1331235,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Emilio Guerra","original_name":"Emilio Guerra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d48de562d1e400199c114a2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2052126,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Blai Barba","original_name":"Blai Barba","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d48de892d1e405082c1c7dc","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2379941,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Renata Lutti","original_name":"Renata Lutti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d48df19028f1474ea00c9f2","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2379947,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marc Lesperut","original_name":"Marc Lesperut","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d48e08d2d1e405db5c1cb5c","department":"Production","job":"Production Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2379939,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mercè Tafalla","original_name":"Mercè Tafalla","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d48def4028f14001200d0f5","department":"Directing","job":"First Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2018090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lola Clavo","original_name":"Lola Clavo","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d48de192d1e405082c1c73b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dtjsKV1jhqsXL3sJJz0vdmScLLq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"‘Muestra de cortos de mujeres y lesbianas sobre violencia’ (Screening of Shorts by Women and Lesbians about Violence)","release_date":"2007-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"No love lost","key":"79189605","site":"Vimeo","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2013-11-12T12:15:03.000Z","id":"5d48ddfb028f14001100c15a"}]}}}
