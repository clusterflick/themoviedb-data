One day, after walking throught the desert for a long time, a woman and a kid end up in this town. The man in a suit offers them to stay the night. The days go by, and they almost don't trade any words between them. The town is always empty, but functioning. They just pass the nights and days inside, dancing without music, playing videogames or walking on the street, under the neon lights of empty shops, making calls without any answer..  The title (Ballad for a Kaiser Carabela) refers to the first family car manufactured in series in Argentina.","popularity":0.0984,"poster_path":"/1yZjDp40D7SocWf5TPVrWO9epnn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ballad for a Kaiser Carabela","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1134927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis Alberto Spinetta","original_name":"Luis Alberto Spinetta","popularity":0.0566,"profile_path":"/rjdAzvZ7pKGenjzmd1BfO0E4osp.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"weird dude in a suit","credit_id":"5d4c75423c434400132b14da","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2381816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudio Ginepro","original_name":"Claudio Ginepro","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"the kid","credit_id":"5d4c75563c434400112b15c5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":132549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofía Viruboff","original_name":"Sofía Viruboff","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":"/36NV7lKZx5Njei2NhMLpcoaZT7W.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"That girl","credit_id":"61e486de6beaea008b999cbd","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1084273,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fernando Spiner","original_name":"Fernando Spiner","popularity":0.078,"profile_path":"/hvWWtWbATn3JYyCzDvnpnu28vZj.jpg","credit_id":"5d4c76b521c4ca0019fd3d7c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1134927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis Alberto Spinetta","original_name":"Luis Alberto Spinetta","popularity":0.0566,"profile_path":"/rjdAzvZ7pKGenjzmd1BfO0E4osp.jpg","credit_id":"5d4c76c8c68b6939fb0d460e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":239249,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eduardo Milewicz","original_name":"Eduardo Milewicz","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e5708efa6d93100125be3a7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.53,"height":1766,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1yZjDp40D7SocWf5TPVrWO9epnn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":936}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"1987 - Balada para un Kaiser Carabela (HQ) Spinetta","key":"RnB31RzjBmI","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2012-06-29T23:01:46.000Z","id":"5d4c70e4c68b690014101154"}]}}}
