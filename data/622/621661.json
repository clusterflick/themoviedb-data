His wife died and he began to drink too much. Paramoshi left a porcelain figurine on a golden pedestal from a past life. Once there was a phone call and a woman's voice, invited the old man to speak at the bottom of the city. Paramosha went to a stop and waited a long time for the coveted black Mercedes from the city hall, but the call was just an insidious ploy of friends who wanted to lure Paramosha out of the apartment and take possession of the figurine.","popularity":0.174,"poster_path":"/yN1360wXGXlD6tAOVezuJQsA7nn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2018-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Парамоша","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Paramosha","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuriy Kuznetsov","original_name":"Юрий Кузнецов","popularity":0.3388,"profile_path":"/ls7argRcyy3X8HhhUPQnv737Xrl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Paramosha","credit_id":"5d4be6de002134001227acc7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2381516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viktor Chuprov","original_name":"Viktor Chuprov","popularity":0.0765,"profile_path":"/6R6jeFFkvnxhWO3UG0lsuwX2ndH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5d4be701002134001427c0fb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2110960,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonina Vvedenskaya","original_name":"Antonina Vvedenskaya","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/1O1GE4GcfRDfAeknQf1utF0cF2E.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5d4be72cc68b6900120ebdb9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1857191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Dragunova","original_name":"Olga Dragunova","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/vtv5KPJi3xCv2w3E6Ta1sLTJxsx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5d4be734002134001527b6fd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2263292,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikita Markeev","original_name":"Никита Маркеев","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/myhqaugdAaGnhtTUoMMauLbZXnx.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5d4be78aa066450016dc73a4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2217987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vasily Ignatich","original_name":"Vasily Ignatich","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/ns6Sewgol7249eW3sujz48BIz7c.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5d4be797002134001327af78","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2376208,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Valeriy Lerner","original_name":"Valeriy Lerner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4be85a4dc34a001062fefe","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2381527,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Denis Obydenov","original_name":"Denis Obydenov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4be83ec68b6900110eca31","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2381529,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Olesya Perich","original_name":"Olesya Perich","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4be8bda066450014dc75f6","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2381525,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandr V.
