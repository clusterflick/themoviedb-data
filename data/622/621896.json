For Australian painter Keith Looby, it cost him almost everything. Winner of prestigious art prizes and collected by major galleries at home and abroad, Keith's addiction to speaking his mind has left a string of failed business relationships, marriages and friendships.  Bludgeoned into coherence by the film-makers, assessed by dealers, curators, critics and fellow artists, Looby is a chance to look at a brilliant artist who had his moment in the sun, and to ask whether he should have another.","popularity":0.1,"poster_path":"/eA8uMumVgPdrAGivayy8HecMW9S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2019-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A documentary film on the life and art of Keith Looby.","title":"Looby","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2382150,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iain Knight","original_name":"Iain Knight","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4d2b31699fb70017a0773b","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2382158,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Merilyn Alt","original_name":"Merilyn Alt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4d2b853c887d667283e344","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2382156,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sean Murphy","original_name":"Sean Murphy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4d2b773c887d0012858000","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2382153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Garner","original_name":"Nick Garner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4d2b511283e90015875750","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12566394","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eA8uMumVgPdrAGivayy8HecMW9S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":161316,"name":"social documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"E","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Premiered at Melbourne Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2019-07-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Looby Film - Trailer","key":"316955112","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-02-13T04:48:26.000Z","id":"5d4d2c131283e90014876083"}]}}}
