Their love games mesh with the games of children on the beach; their dialogues are a mixture of Romanian and Russian, humorous and lyrical at the same time. But the soldier has to return to duty, and all that's left for the girl is the hope that the two will meet again some day.  The movie was banned and never released in theaters in Romania, the premiere was in Israel,
