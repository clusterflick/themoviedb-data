We learn where the name came from and why the Directors Guild of America (DGA) first allowed his name to be used on Richard Widmark's western Death of a Gunfighter. The film follows the numerous problems that director Tony Kaye had during the production and post-production of the film American History X and why the DGA refused to allow Alan Smithee to be credited for that film.","popularity":0.3472,"poster_path":"/jYO995OMK6WnO80NWdiRkqrGQOF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37918,"logo_path":null,"name":"Winstar Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":143180,"logo_path":null,"name":"Orchard Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Directed by Alan Smithee","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Who Is Alan Smithee?","type":"Original title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Bucatinsky","original_name":"Dan Bucatinsky","popularity":0.2852,"profile_path":"/5MmGUnWjNeOwcWhndqhQPi7URvv.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6314ce39f1b5710082c9a3f8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":565205,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lesli Klainberg","original_name":"Lesli Klainberg","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6314cd69bb105700833b0894","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":185678,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julie Goldman","original_name":"Julie Goldman","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/a0gcL0iZdVr8pOXsJBgGbYzp9Zu.jpg","credit_id":"6314cd86d40d4c007ab0bad2","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1383817,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Caroline Stevens","original_name":"Caroline Stevens","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6314cd960cb335009187ea5c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1256783,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maia Harris","original_name":"Maia Harris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6314cdbe1511aa007ba4333e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":565205,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lesli Klainberg","original_name":"Lesli Klainberg","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6314cdd60d2944007e84f891","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1190461,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"George O'Donnell","original_name":"George O'Donnell","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6314cdefb3e6270083519532","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1941970,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ann Rose","original_name":"Ann Rose","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6314ce05c048a9008fe9e9b0","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":577751,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Douglas J.
