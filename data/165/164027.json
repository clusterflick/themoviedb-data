The story begins in a contemporary theater where a projectionist describes, to movie director Rex Prince, the ghostly spirit that seems to be haunting his film. The story then races backward to the 1960s when a half-mad, idealistic Rex was busily making his first film, a Marxist tract depicting poverty in Montreal. Edouard Dore, a well-connected editor works with him and it is he who takes Rex to a carnival late one night to meet the performers in a freakshow. The first person Rex meets is Le Grand Zenon, a hulking one-eyed fellow with the amazing ability to use his eye to project movie images on a screen with neither a projector nor film.","popularity":0.6261,"poster_path":"/spXp8XA17oz7OwfFIOcPEVEYG5b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8117,"logo_path":"/eVsVPEZRK63zsQMxxSHf5Cv017g.png","name":"Max
