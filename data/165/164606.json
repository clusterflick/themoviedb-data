Each frame is printed twice, so that its effective speed (at 24fps) is 12 frames per second. A variety of organic and crystalline painted shapes (painted on clear leader, thus as if brilliantly back-lit in a blazing space of light) are interspersed with very dark (black leader) passages as if etched with scratches of light and stained radiances. There are also some straight, multi-colored, bars which move, diagonally from one side of the film frame to the other. All these \"themes\" finally give way to clear thick gelatinous effects which resolve themselves in a long passage of hieroglyphic white shapes in a black field, ending on a brief spate of variable coloration.","popularity":0.118,"poster_path":"/40duCxitoApeMBupnhYAoZjewHO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Take These Truths","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Brakhage","original_name":"Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg","credit_id":"5413601d0e0a264f44000a4a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0113370","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/40duCxitoApeMBupnhYAoZjewHO.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1146,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zUJ4ZrwiRnCpbugeddCmz6LfzOF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":764},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1932,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ab3ctWDQ954KQ0QttG59y1ryVmp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1288}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Museum of Modern Art","release_date":"1995-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
