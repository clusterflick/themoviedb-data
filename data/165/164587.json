Young Peggy, as she likes to be called, goes to Smith College in Massachusetts and hates it. Back in Atlanta, her mildly scandalous reputation is made more so by her first marriage, to Red Upshaw, a bootlegging rake. Later, her second husband encourages her to expand her writing talents beyond feature articles for The Atlanta Journal. Her first and only novel becomes one of the best-selling books of all time.","popularity":1.7445,"poster_path":"/iBixmUshuk94ZD2UnzgXtDSAPqC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Burning Passion: The Margaret Mitchell Story","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":19144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shannen Doherty","original_name":"Shannen Doherty","popularity":1.3601,"profile_path":"/mx56qq8Md5GsC3TgHfPmbTb9mrv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Margaret","credit_id":"52fe4c7cc3a36847f8230b71","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dale Midkiff","original_name":"Dale Midkiff","popularity":0.3937,"profile_path":"/lOxrQtMLFlbZQs8hykfCQzPfMSg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Red","credit_id":"52fe4c7cc3a36847f8230b75","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1046158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Clark Gable","original_name":"John Clark Gable","popularity":0.1162,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Army Officer Terry","credit_id":"52fe4c7cc3a36847f8230b79","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Mulhern","original_name":"Matt Mulhern","popularity":0.2779,"profile_path":"/dtYWbp0VeAcU8pKRwciGJbleaWw.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"John Marsh","credit_id":"64e36174b77d4b1141faf9fd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":83145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann Wedgeworth","original_name":"Ann Wedgeworth","popularity":0.1823,"profile_path":"/qi153PFDSHi5afMBkdEqquXwxWc.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mrs. O'Flaherty","credit_id":"64e36191d7cd0600af84561d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morgan Weisser","original_name":"Morgan Weisser","popularity":0.2455,"profile_path":"/pwGiFmZZ4IeUitjmSEggqi176SJ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Clifford","credit_id":"64e361a4076ce843b74de841","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":41689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rue McClanahan","original_name":"Rue McClanahan","popularity":0.7823,"profile_path":"/5obbwWKm2QWezmeBuOqA6vfXjlS.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Grandma Stephens","credit_id":"64e361bd076ce843b74de855","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robin Mullins","original_name":"Robin Mullins","popularity":0.3441,"profile_path":"/abV5uGsLYDgfpnW0uvgXDC5isv3.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Medora","credit_id":"64e361d1544c4100ac3d0f19","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":80784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shannon Eubanks","original_name":"Shannon Eubanks","popularity":0.2044,"profile_path":"/gPMTILVU2ID9BuruJ4nYpcLY9Rv.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Mrs. Cathcart","credit_id":"64e361ea65e0a20139ff970b","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":174254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joanne Pankow","original_name":"Joanne Pankow","popularity":0.0724,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Mrs. Pinchot","credit_id":"64e36201076ce843b74de88f","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3182602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evan Kelly","original_name":"Evan Kelly","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Will","credit_id":"64e3621b7ef381209f45311e","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Ward","original_name":"John Ward","popularity":0.0682,"profile_path":"/wbBR0iHXvmpMlxwHdGIVp1EJIVT.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Beau","credit_id":"64e36236b77d4b11426125e9","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1392671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zach Hanner","original_name":"Zach Hanner","popularity":0.0948,"profile_path":"/81YMhZI1Ys2Oi5XFkn54ljwx3vb.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Tom","credit_id":"64e36243544c4100fe9277e8","order":12}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51373,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Larry Peerce","original_name":"Larry Peerce","popularity":0.324,"profile_path":"/1Vv3subCB4Jp8GM6KLPY8mVOEfm.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c7cc3a36847f8230b6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1258847,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Renée Valente","original_name":"Renée Valente","popularity":0.0627,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65179243ea84c7012d66e738","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56353,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Don E.
