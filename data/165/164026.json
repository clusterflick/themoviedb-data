The film spotlights two now legendary performers much earlier in their careers: Ethel Waters and Sammy Davis Jr. In his first screen appearance, around the age of seven, pint-sized Davis sings, dances and clowns.  Nicknamed 'the beanpole' slim and slinky Waters looks far different from the heavier figure she displayed in Pinky (1949) and Member of the Wedding (1953). Statuesque in a long glamorous white gown, she sings her big hit \"Am I Blue.\" Davis, in turn sings \"I'll Be Glad When You're Dead You Rascal You.\" (Separate Cinema)","popularity":0.5148,"poster_path":"/7IpoF49S9xqN2r1H5HK3U5uViao.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174,"logo_path":"/zhD3hhtKB5qyv7ZeL4uLpNxgMVU.png","name":"Warner Bros.
