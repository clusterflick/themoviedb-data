These dreams become reality when they photograph a gigantic fish leaping out of the sea and their small town blossoms into a tourist hot-spot as a result. But for Mbwana, the reality isn't what he dreamed – and when he meets the fish again, both of them forgotten, ruined and old, he decides only one of them can survive. Jonah is a big fish story about the old and the new, and the links and the distances between them. A visual feast, shot though with humour and warmth, it tells an old story in a completely new way.","popularity":1.0649,"poster_path":"/dMVWHs7dPClSQFiHfZcFbjcYrwy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16878,"logo_path":"/cDuJvMrSN1gHcMBNUHdV5YrmJuI.png","name":"Factory
