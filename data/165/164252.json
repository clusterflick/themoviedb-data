The boy grows up to be a railroad engineer, too, but one day the train he is piloting loses its brakes and wrecks. Jimmy tries to fix it but has to jump off at the last minute.

He sets out to clear his name.","popularity":0.2204,"poster_path":"/qd5mwL6tBwggDdVpqX2LfFO8ebk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15247,"logo_path":null,"name":"I.E.
