A moon lifts out of this dark weave to be replaced by autumn leaves against a grainy sky, a fiery sky. A gray cat licks itself. A black cat sits quickly down on a green lawn.  A \"night\" of showering dark, a \"dawn\" of pinks and yellows of plant growth in close-up. A gentle yellow \"high noon\" prevails into which the orange worm appears and reappears, twisting, arching, turning. A phosphorescent orange of leaves explodes midst greens and black holes appropriate to the image of the worm. The forms of many varieties of leafage mix with a veritable rain or clash of overall tones, a fire of forms, a glowing color photo-negative of worm, and the final canopies of autumn tone and sky tone permeated by sun, sun streaks and octagonal prism shapes ad infinitum.","popularity":0.1542,"poster_path":"/caZ0f3glHYYpp2qe5vKLcwYBFBz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The cat","title":"The Cat of the Worm's Green Realm","video":false,"vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Brakhage","original_name":"Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg","credit_id":"54eb15079251412eae00675f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0281701","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eWhSl9lgHH26XC5eJY8cbHtR4QG.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/caZ0f3glHYYpp2qe5vKLcwYBFBz.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2S6Vcfb84LFYTQV4kRW7deuAU9Y.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.687,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jobOxDRKMI6Ux4wVWh5d7sq9Rfn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":515},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1932,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ab3ctWDQ954KQ0QttG59y1ryVmp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1288},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nBJUgj7gRabvMC6ATYqHllbDaZD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vpcQgjiDJx8z7Uu7VcacUVojW0O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2NmLAnYAiYhDCpQBa66Jwk9osLI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jt17ihw1WFAVpK9Ho5QFCl8xSsM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8RN8JyTlDQTDXYIVPk6nkx9NE85.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xQwbRK8vMkzHSQn21D0s3viBs80.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3M9fxMzs2JCkyYskd4K5Fs7JFrR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1550,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hED2ukHEveOameBBSqs2NCKurso.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1033}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
