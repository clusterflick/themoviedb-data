We are watching a boy of ten being confrontend with two of the most prevalent taboos: death and sexuality. The generally accepted forms of recourse offered by religion and society have cracks, don't work any more, and thus are being ignored, by-passed or interpreted from a child's angle.

eyes.","popularity":0.1356,"poster_path":"/ixZiZq0LiZcwHYulzF6fm3PJJoy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1990-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Himmel
