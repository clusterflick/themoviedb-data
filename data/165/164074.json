Jesse Howl (Douglas Spain), a teenager of Native American ancestry, has just moved to Calamus Grove, and soon finds he doesn't fit in this close-knit community. Wade and Lorna go out of their way to befriend Jesse, and soon find that they're also regarded as outcasts among their peers. Eager to get away from the narrow minds which are stifling them, the three friends grab a car and take off for a summer road trip that turns out to be full of lessons in life and love.","popularity":1.98,"poster_path":"/lpjCbXxMIrZjQA1V1rKMQDfwUhV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
