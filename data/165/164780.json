Her experience inspired this film, made by her film director husband (Chariots of Fire, Greystoke, The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes and Revolution). It leads the viewer on a personal journey of recovery, giving a sense of hope to those who are isolated by their condition, one that is not seen and therefore often misunderstood. At times both traumatic and uplifting, this is an intelligent and informative documentary.","popularity":0.4019,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rupture: A Matter of Life OR Death","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maryam d'Abo","original_name":"Maryam d'Abo","popularity":0.5873,"profile_path":"/AwcD84CIlQ0HaLRX3AqlmunYzgE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5778ee2a925141528e0000eb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nigel Havers","original_name":"Nigel Havers","popularity":0.4441,"profile_path":"/75jjShxtJnsvWu4QwiYPjNPQjsf.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5778ee3792514152ef0000cc","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58220,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugh Hudson","original_name":"Hugh Hudson","popularity":0.1903,"profile_path":"/mVuyIOGwLBMGABMoZwLVCqowLuo.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c7fc3a36847f8231363","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":595,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vangelis","original_name":"Vangelis","popularity":0.3954,"profile_path":"/7qSj7Dk0mMytSxSHTsSIi4tmgnu.jpg","credit_id":"5778ee4cc3a36832b00028b7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2076319","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
