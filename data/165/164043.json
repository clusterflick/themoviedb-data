The film provides a personal glimpse of some of America's favorite actors as they step out of their comfort zones--from Cheyenne Jackson's \"fear, sweat, adrenaline and Red Bull\" to Rachel Dratch's mounting dread at the prospect of singing alongside Broadway's finest voices. Richard Kind sums it up: \"It's like a roller-coaster. You're terrified, but it's fun!\" Watching this insane theatrical challenge keeps you on the edge of your seat and laughing.","popularity":1.2786,"poster_path":"/4thj0YN823EN13uXpmeYboAq3ls.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"From the blank page to the live stage, all within 24 hours.","title":"One Night Stand","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":212828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cheyenne Jackson","original_name":"Cheyenne Jackson","popularity":0.7723,"profile_path":"/o1yZF6R450iIpl4kZK0YEgm3mCj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c73c3a36847f822eaa3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":32905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Dratch","original_name":"Rachel Dratch","popularity":1.0903,"profile_path":"/j8vNwap7BM69dRz5zXVWvIn4lJ7.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c73c3a36847f822eaa7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":204815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jesse Tyler Ferguson","original_name":"Jesse Tyler Ferguson","popularity":0.6178,"profile_path":"/zeWJZZrCtzUZqyOxOQB4xzuSup1.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5413bfb9c3a3687dbe000b5b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Kind","original_name":"Richard Kind","popularity":1.6439,"profile_path":"/yWmuVQeQUzb5OSMVDoWkR0IylCK.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c73c3a36847f822eaaf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":47298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nellie McKay","original_name":"Nellie McKay","popularity":0.1161,"profile_path":"/yeTCAVj1T19WfkSN84M0GLx6KQk.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c73c3a36847f822eab3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tracie Thoms","original_name":"Tracie Thoms","popularity":1.0746,"profile_path":"/fOyAo4KucqxaSd2obOKufwNMwGQ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c73c3a36847f822eab7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1085462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mandy Gonzalez","original_name":"Mandy Gonzalez","popularity":0.1455,"profile_path":"/oxPTyTQfArSaLvky65Vunh2b6er.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c73c3a36847f822eabb","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1145515,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Trish Dalton","original_name":"Trish Dalton","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c73c3a36847f822ea99","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1145516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elizabeth Sperling","original_name":"Elizabeth Sperling","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c73c3a36847f822ea9f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1726707","wikidata_id":"Q109649158","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rAWKTPtfojweXNk9a16dK5B03qX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4thj0YN823EN13uXpmeYboAq3ls.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Austin Film Festival","release_date":"2011-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
