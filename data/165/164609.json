In that early epic I had envisioned The World Tree as dead, fit only for firewood; and at end of DOG STAR MAN I had chopped it up amidst a flurry of stars (finally Cassiopia's Chair): now, these many years later, I am compelled to comprehend YGGDRASILL as rooted in the complex electrical synapses of thought process, to sense it being alive today as when nordic legendry hatched it. I share this compulsion with Andrei Tarkovsky, whose last film The Sacrifice struggles to revive The World Tree narratively, whereas I simply present (one might almost say \"document\") a moving graph approximate to my thought process, whereby The Tree roots itself as the stars we, reflectively, are.","popularity":0.1658,"poster_path":"/c0tYRhY1mJMpB3XwshpxpuUHdt4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yggdrasill: Whose Roots Are Stars in the Human Mind","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":14,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Yggdrasill: Cujas Raízes são Estrelas na Mente Humana","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Brakhage","original_name":"Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg","credit_id":"54eb185ac3a36836d9006410","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0282269","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/slAQWwwDLNe1kPnM8ql2vEYOaQF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1145,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hLIMQ8eqH0WXQo4ug0fwWFa4Xw8.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":763},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1145,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AqsDTKXoUc8IBCigwEgNr4GbYvV.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":763},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/c0tYRhY1mJMpB3XwshpxpuUHdt4.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2400,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7ZjVBJPrM2wdp0eJc4zlMuXYoj0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i8qD8NMM3trxSZ9pLP2EZmxcESq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"New York Film Festival","release_date":"1997-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
