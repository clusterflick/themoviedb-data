Rose gives each child loving attention, and soon she's their favorite. An especially needy child is Marie, a prostitute's daughter. Rose and she bond, and Marie is jealous of all attentions paid Rose, especially those of Dr. Libois, the school's physician. When Rose inadvertently guides the children through the educational experiment of a visiting scholar, and then discloses she has a college degree and is working beneath her station, the principal wants to fire her. Is there any way she can stay? And what will happen to Marie?","popularity":0.2562,"poster_path":"/apJ2v3ZaVIFAV0IaYjBmA745liJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1933-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children of Montmartre","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Children of Montmartre","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":236906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madeleine Renaud","original_name":"Madeleine Renaud","popularity":0.1974,"profile_path":"/2V50NFeaAU9AvER0aNVTlrXnbpO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Rose","credit_id":"52fe4c7ec3a36847f823101f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":553634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Tissot","original_name":"Alice Tissot","popularity":0.0968,"profile_path":"/8WZGSLi8NdkIB6lsmGvXUHO2fcS.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Superintendent","credit_id":"52fe4c7ec3a36847f8231023","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1146133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paulette Élambert","original_name":"Paulette Élambert","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Marie Coeuret","credit_id":"52fe4c7ec3a36847f8231027","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1146134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvette Fillacier","original_name":"Sylvette Fillacier","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/ycNjscLUNPfSP9N5DlPjHlzopuj.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mme.
