Football jock Alex taunts Victor Tran, a new student, until Victor knocks Alex down with one swift kick. Alex continues to antagonize Victor, and as Victor finds it increasingly hard to resist a fight, his father reminds him of the true purpose of martial arts, the secret of the “horse stance,” and the real meaning of sacrificial love. Based on Christ’s own endurance of suffering in the Scourging at the Pillar, this action drama will engage viewers of all ages both with its amazing martial arts sequences and its lessons of wisdom, strength, friendship and sacrifice for others.","popularity":0.3995,"poster_path":"/9JItav7CkuGAN3M3K7K0QiCKgcH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Secret of the Horse","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernie Reyes Jr.","original_name":"Ernie Reyes Jr.","popularity":0.4275,"profile_path":"/8oBXNulh6U5YM6Ab5RJljk39LOP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Victor Tran","credit_id":"679f9c1250f5d47625261992","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Cheung","original_name":"張佐治","popularity":0.8201,"profile_path":"/oqVIeE1acnBzPboiP4UqGSIPWB0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Duc Tran","credit_id":"679f9c2a28bb97ddd3956fb5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2221760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Tran","original_name":"Linda Tran","popularity":0.0946,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Bernadette Tran","credit_id":"679f9c4b04cb6f41b9cb6c13","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Reyes","original_name":"Lee Reyes","popularity":0.1648,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Alex","credit_id":"679f9c5a50f5d476252619b9","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9JItav7CkuGAN3M3K7K0QiCKgcH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
