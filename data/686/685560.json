One night at a dinner party, she informs Maure that she is engaged to young VIncent Pamfort and is leaving for England the next day to marry him. Maure tricks her into meeting him onboard a boat going to Palermo, and before they get there she suddenly grabs her and jumps overboard. They wind up in a fishing village on a small island and before long find themselves caught up in a cholera epidemic and a local criminal gang.","popularity":0.2693,"poster_path":"/b9gXHEE5Zg7M8Kt2CoFUw67tzvc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1926-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Blonde Saint","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lewis Stone","original_name":"Lewis Stone","popularity":0.3048,"profile_path":"/wjIS8X6Smdbwb7CTQVyWelyZutk.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sebastian Maure","credit_id":"5e77cb72d18b2400198093ad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148837,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doris Kenyon","original_name":"Doris Kenyon","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":"/laM51FLnMQbtaSiAZYyUpd4ZRB7.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ghirlaine Bellamy","credit_id":"5e77cbf6fea0d7001a5e15e5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2339856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann Rork","original_name":"Ann Rork","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/6XEZnt1dfJb4fv15r20lQLjooZs.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Fannia","credit_id":"5e77cc00c8a2d400172110a3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29273,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gilbert Roland","original_name":"Gilbert Roland","popularity":0.7805,"profile_path":"/mzFPFiCb7fNsGI9gBFHYn0kqg7g.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Annibale","credit_id":"5e77cc0aa055ef00142eb6ea","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":940168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cesare Gravina","original_name":"Cesare Gravina","popularity":0.1748,"profile_path":"/dwrv8VttqLIDlp7M5P6fUftRdhd.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Ilario","credit_id":"5e77cc19fea0d700155e15ba","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1130797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malcolm Denny","original_name":"Malcolm Denny","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":"/7cBEWKpAnTtmBps3TVzYKrdKk7A.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Vincent Pamfort","credit_id":"5e77cc24b974420015d40256","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Conti","original_name":"Albert Conti","popularity":0.1562,"profile_path":"/sBvjKclAZPsCrPFyGzOawWMQjJG.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Andreas","credit_id":"5e77cc2f357c00001152452d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1358273,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vadim Uraneff","original_name":"Vadim Uraneff","popularity":0.0656,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Nino","credit_id":"5e77cc38cabfe4001822c634","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Langdon","original_name":"Lillian Langdon","popularity":0.099,"profile_path":"/kOtKzUcdm9SChzXxyj29DfxGMQY.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Anne's Aunt","credit_id":"5e77cc40b974420015d40269","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo White","original_name":"Leo White","popularity":0.1971,"profile_path":"/pKJDApReiE0EVmmkTYbHNW7d1Yu.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Tito","credit_id":"5e77cc48fea0d7001a5e1639","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157938,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Svend Gade","original_name":"Svend Gade","popularity":0.0559,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e77cac8b974420015d400d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29251,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marion Fairfax","original_name":"Marion Fairfax","popularity":0.0605,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e77cad16f31af00132e098c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8713,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tony Gaudio","original_name":"Tony Gaudio","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":"/jMTzpQoyiCV2lhd8A7SvoUVknsY.jpg","credit_id":"5e77cb62a055ef00122eee99","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0016661","wikidata_id":"Q7718648","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b9gXHEE5Zg7M8Kt2CoFUw67tzvc.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1926-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
