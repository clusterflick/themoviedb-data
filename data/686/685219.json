Catalyst examines multiple separate, yet coexisting memories drawn from footage I acquired at various times and different places in North America.

A story that takes place in time and space, shaped by the earth and sky.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/dgfmUqmT1QRqyncbVFTlljg7MSF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Catalyst","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2307173,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kent Tate","original_name":"Kent Tate","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e766ef9cabfe4001322159f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1595,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dgfmUqmT1QRqyncbVFTlljg7MSF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1062}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
