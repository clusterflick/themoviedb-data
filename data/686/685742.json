With Bohemian Rhapsody halfway through its nine-week run atop the charts in December 1975, Queen chose Christmas Eve to play a televised tour de force from London's Hammersmith Odeon. Freddie Mercury had a deep-rooted love for everything Christmas, with a lifelong generosity of spirit. In this documentary, friends and loved ones reflect on the band, alongside many of Queen's best-loved hits and rare footage of Mercury with some of his closest confidantes.","popularity":0.6298,"poster_path":"/yuC4j3UhAHsdVBbcLJV141BL0NO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18753,"logo_path":"/sFyZVc90OIHYISn7SjWA19qZUE.png","name":"North One Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-12-19","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Freddie Mercury had a love for Christmas","title":"Freddie Mercury: A Christmas Story","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Freddie Mercury","original_name":"Freddie Mercury","popularity":0.5671,"profile_path":"/29YpQZNzrGJtoa49ZVo2XLKZuQr.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"6079bc3e8566d20078b4c8e3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Taylor","original_name":"Roger Taylor","popularity":0.3205,"profile_path":"/4bGDceuYlMPBXIp4XgwettWynJt.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6079bd869f37b0004068e37e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1407318,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Hince","original_name":"Peter Hince","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6079bc457a97ab006deb189f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2175567,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Freestone","original_name":"Peter Freestone","popularity":0.0723,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6079bc4af6787a0058f6cf20","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1246156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Myskow","original_name":"Nina Myskow","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":"/1uuSo3ECzjLf8ynGi3ELjkcCEDg.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6079bcacf48e0d00573f6214","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2970931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Wigg","original_name":"David Wigg","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6079bccffb834600579530e2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2400104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Aizlewood","original_name":"John Aizlewood","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6079bd0c9f37b00057a54de8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3055200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gordon Dalziel","original_name":"Gordon Dalziel","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6079bdc09f37b00057a54ed2","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1217868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wayne Sleep","original_name":"Wayne Sleep","popularity":0.0933,"profile_path":"/l6wtrz54hbtrVY43cC6wkFJTf3Q.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6079bc75fb83460042c19bc7","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":75478,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Turnbull","original_name":"Mark Turnbull","popularity":0.1388,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e78b02dc8a2d4001322253a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2576099,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Hill","original_name":"Chris Hill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e78b098a055ef00142fbf25","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":75478,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Turnbull","original_name":"Mark Turnbull","popularity":0.1388,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e78b000357c000016521337","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1838160,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Quinn","original_name":"John Quinn","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e78b062a055ef001230102b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yuC4j3UhAHsdVBbcLJV141BL0NO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
