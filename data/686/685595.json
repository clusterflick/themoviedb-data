He tries to convince his partner, Jim Tyler, than it's cheaper to be married than to continually \"play the field\". The main reason he's doing that is because Jim is obsessed with the beautiful Evelyn, a gold-digger on whom Jim is spending prodigious amounts of money.

Something has to be done.","popularity":0.3249,"poster_path":"/v5PEM6cd0QZxkmUdMBH19wyOnAM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1925-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cheaper to Marry","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Conrad Nagel","original_name":"Conrad Nagel","popularity":0.216,"profile_path":"/eq8mN5jfRlkKhU0AlOtbSTtZdeS.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Dick Tyler","credit_id":"5e77e0fecabfe4001323e1a2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lewis Stone","original_name":"Lewis Stone","popularity":0.3048,"profile_path":"/wjIS8X6Smdbwb7CTQVyWelyZutk.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Jim Knight","credit_id":"5e77e105c8a2d4001921255f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paulette Duval","original_name":"Paulette Duval","popularity":0.1599,"profile_path":"/qfnNwcOv6Jj4fy9pxbBQexRnUze.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Evelyn","credit_id":"5e77e110357c00001950e861","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":128325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marguerite De La Motte","original_name":"Marguerite De La Motte","popularity":0.1061,"profile_path":"/lVTbD5zc5luU1vS64SPF2d7k8Ov.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Doris","credit_id":"5e77e11d2f3b170017526733","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":97989,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Fazenda","original_name":"Louise Fazenda","popularity":0.3299,"profile_path":"/koJe4g2nqMB58S92UUV8Spa4fj4.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Flora","credit_id":"5e77e127fea0d700185e27f0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claude Gillingwater","original_name":"Claude Gillingwater","popularity":0.1147,"profile_path":"/9AMgwHyCDNveG6AkQvp8hQN0xgN.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Riddle","credit_id":"5e77e132d18b24001580a7e9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1362407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Wayne","original_name":"Richard Wayne","popularity":0.0692,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Dal Whitney","credit_id":"5e77e13c6f31af00172e1655","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2575525,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Todd","original_name":"David Todd","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e77e0f06f31af00152e1ca3","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170327,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frederic Hatton","original_name":"Frederic Hatton","popularity":0.0793,"profile_path":"/gcjvPmS3d7quxUSUn1i0gRoxFaB.jpg","credit_id":"5e77e090c8a2d400192124e2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93906,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Z.
