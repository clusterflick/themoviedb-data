During his office, Godbout helped lay the groundwork for the Quiet Revolution of the 1950s and 1960s: instituting compulsory education, giving women the vote, creating Hydro-Québec and trying to free the province from domination by the clergy. Yet, during the conscription crisis, he favoured sending volunteers to fight Hitler: a sin for which many would never forgive him. Filmmaker Jacques Godbout takes a fresh look at his great-uncle's legacy.","popularity":0.4397,"poster_path":"/9O90EkWHbzajtyvpwRCXYDZj5Ec.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Traitor or Patriot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2716444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Amyot","original_name":"Eric Amyot","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f1357bb1d78f20033221f83","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2716445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serge Bernier","original_name":"Serge Bernier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5f1357c1d46537003463f4d7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2175248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gérard Bouchard","original_name":"Gérard Bouchard","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/sYCdtg2HNH3S1ncwxahqfRKyv6S.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5f1357d74083b30034038cfa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2716446,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy Bouthillier","original_name":"Guy Bouthillier","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5f1357e3d46537003665acd2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2716447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul-André Comeau","original_name":"Paul-André Comeau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5f1357f0b87aec003421bb86","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2716448,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Micheline Dumont","original_name":"Micheline Dumont","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5f1357fa4083b3003603959d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2716449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gérard Filion","original_name":"Gérard Filion","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5f1358081d78f200322695c8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1579283,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Josh Freed","original_name":"Josh Freed","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5f13582e1d78f2003522dbcc","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2716451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Louis Gagnon","original_name":"Jean-Louis Gagnon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"5f13583bd46537003665ad7f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2716452,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adélard Godbout","original_name":"Adélard Godbout","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"5f13584a65c26c0037badf13","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2716453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denis Monière","original_name":"Denis Monière","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"5f135857b87aec003421bc64","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2716454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madeleine Parent","original_name":"Madeleine Parent","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"","credit_id":"5f1358601d78f2003522dbee","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1940035,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pascale Bilodeau","original_name":"Pascale Bilodeau","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651da7e85b1240013c7bbf51","department":"Production","job":"Research Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1940035,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pascale Bilodeau","original_name":"Pascale Bilodeau","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651da7fa74507d00ff97e0c3","department":"Writing","job":"Writers' Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2697131,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Martin F.
