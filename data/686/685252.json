Based on Dante s writings, the seven deadly sins correspond to the seven stories of Dante s Mt. Purgatory. Pride, envy, anger, sloth, gluttony, avarice and lust are all presented as patterns of dysfunction within us that lead to unhappiness. However, Bishop Barron shows us how to counteract these seven sinful patterns through a conscious process of opposition, which are the seven lively virtues. The seven lively virtues offer antidotes to each sin and help set us on the right path to healing and happiness.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/56P6Z2mEab2l7kAlsOXuqc4tp47.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seven Deadly Sins Seven Lively Virtues","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1446695,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Bishop Robert E.
