The 1985 conference, chaired by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, was the fourth and final meeting to determine an amendment to Indigenous rights as defined in the Constitution. The provincial premiers again refuse to reach an agreement with the First Nations, Metis and Inuit leaders, even though the majority of Canadians supported the inclusion of Indigenous rights to self-government. Director Bulbulian captures the pride and determination of Indigenous leaders and community members who refuse to back down on this historic opportunity to enshrine their rights, and the arrogance of the First Ministers who are fighting to keep power within the federal and provincial governments.","popularity":0.126,"poster_path":"/nrIzZlFg8wx4CIUJOAUr3vEnhZa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dancing Around the Table, Part Two","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"L'art de tourner en rond: 2e partie","type":"French language version"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2352764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Nadeau","original_name":"Pierre Nadeau","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5f0a3234d5ffcb003387059a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1618212,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maurice Bulbulian","original_name":"Maurice Bulbulian","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e79559aa055ef001830cb6b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0269129","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jCI6uEwn4ooETSB8ijoUnYmMta4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nrIzZlFg8wx4CIUJOAUr3vEnhZa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
