What follows is a short, Hugh Jackman-centric look at the film's production, focusing on the character of Wolverine. The film's stunt coordinator discusses Jackman's commitment to bulking up-drinking a dozen egg whites a day and going on an intense fitness regime-and director Gavin Hood explains Wolverine's degree of self-loathing about his own nature. We also see some of the design work that went into the film, including the sculpting of young Logan's bone claws and the re-invention of the adamantium tank. Jackman comes off personable as always, and it's clear that he really loves this role.","popularity":1.0249,"poster_path":"/xTfTwH4jEiPsbTSjfDsY8eS3zV0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wolverine Unleashed: The Complete Origins","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":958540,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alec Gillis","original_name":"Alec Gillis","popularity":0.3902,"profile_path":"/3pglJqJepYKuE8B9aIAd4Z3qX0y.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e7968eea055ef001830f95d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Henney","original_name":"Daniel Henney","popularity":1.6934,"profile_path":"/elAolohpUG5nS99EZxHZjd44DsS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e796910c8a2d400152375fa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13079,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gavin Hood","original_name":"Gavin Hood","popularity":0.2348,"profile_path":"/2y2eX4m7qsDgbo51XAK6TE6dJon.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e796930357c00001952d0bc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugh Jackman","original_name":"Hugh Jackman","popularity":5.6506,"profile_path":"/4Xujtewxqt6aU0Y81tsS9gkjizk.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e79694dc8a2d40015237672","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1290687,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Patrick McClung","original_name":"Patrick McClung","popularity":0.0755,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e796967cabfe4001123f35f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominic Monaghan","original_name":"Dominic Monaghan","popularity":1.0855,"profile_path":"/lOWmAvBu6evsj9MCcIHqy7Sg3iZ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e7969a8a055ef001430c149","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131532,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"J.J.
