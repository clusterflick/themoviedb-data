The 1984 Federal Provincial Conference of First Ministers on Aboriginal Constitutional Matters was a tumultuous and antagonistic process that pitted Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau and the First Ministers—who refused to include Indigenous inherent rights to self-government in the Constitution—against First Nations, Inuit and Métis leaders, who would not back down from this historic opportunity to enshrine Indigenous rights. The conference was Pierre Elliott Trudeau’s last constitutional meeting before he resigned and the process was handed over to his successor, Brian Mulroney.","popularity":0.6542,"poster_path":"/dUKdfWD6MjrCTs95V10FgYZLdIK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dancing Around the Table, Part One","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"L'art de tourner en rond: 1ère partie","type":"French Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2352764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Nadeau","original_name":"Pierre Nadeau","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5f08be191d1bf400386962b0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1351515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Elliott Trudeau","original_name":"Pierre Elliott Trudeau","popularity":0.1504,"profile_path":"/tpdjMQT7fCrtCHoHojsddxDthZs.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61b3c71c0372640041233bbc","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3964125,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Séraphin Bouchard","original_name":"Séraphin Bouchard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64122930e18e3f07b424f0d8","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2011661,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"François Vincelette","original_name":"François Vincelette","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6412291ba6c10400c0c63da4","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1837478,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yvon Benoît","original_name":"Yvon Benoît","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6412294ae18e3f08403c3fed","department":"Sound","job":"Location Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1618212,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maurice Bulbulian","original_name":"Maurice Bulbulian","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641228ebfe6c1800daef1f25","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3958332,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrew Koster","original_name":"Andrew Koster","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6412296b26677800ec69644b","department":"Sound","job":"Location Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1410992,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Roger Lamoureux","original_name":"Roger Lamoureux","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641229916a344800835ce6b3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3964133,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sophie T.
