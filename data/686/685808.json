Freud's account of his sessions with Dora was the only major case history he published of a female patient. Intercutting his published text with a scripted version told from Dora's point of view, Hysterical Girl revisits this landmark case. Woven throughout are several decades of cinema, Congressional hearings, and media coverage. What emerges is a portrait of the grip that Freudâ€™s theory of hysteria has had on popular culture over the past century and into the present day.","popularity":0.1113,"poster_path":"/5oxswLf0LpkAgV2FihKYPM2j1DN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131013,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rossvack Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hysterical Girl","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2576421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tommy Vines","original_name":"Tommy Vines","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/hzXmK5rEujHXiiS9xdBuSapVqUR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dora","credit_id":"5e78f3edd18b240013823d99","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":217781,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brian Kelly","original_name":"Brian Kelly","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":"/zbjxEPS5aPP1qwIOx2WSGi37Eol.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sigmund Freud","credit_id":"5e78f410c8a2d40013227fbd","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1396287,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bryan Sarkinen","original_name":"Bryan Sarkinen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646ae85c2bcf67015583b074","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Rossi","original_name":"Andrew Rossi","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646ae86054a09800e40fbce4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":932203,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kate Novack","original_name":"Kate Novack","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e78f4392f3b1700115445f0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2576423,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Steven Ross","original_name":"Steven Ross","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e78f475cabfe40018245d0e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":932203,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kate Novack","original_name":"Kate Novack","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e78f42c357c000016527ade","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Rossi","original_name":"Andrew Rossi","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e78f458d18b24001981f513","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11878978","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.562,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3S4G8q055zia0g0FeZoz8PjzaYy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":562},{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":2500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5oxswLf0LpkAgV2FihKYPM2j1DN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1693}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
