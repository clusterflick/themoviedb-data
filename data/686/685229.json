This was the case for author Noël Balen, who was inspired to write a collection of poems, accompanied by a record, as a tribute to legendary double bassist Charles Mingus. A genuine work of art, this documentary filmed in black and white hooks us into the bewitching world of jazz. Artists and singers give voice to Balen’s poems, accompanied by the immortal music of Mingus. A dazzling musical voyage, as bold as it is inventive.","popularity":0.0895,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mingus Erectus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Mingus","original_name":"Charles Mingus","popularity":0.0763,"profile_path":"/yMAEEKuTqkuT4MN2isvD98AHCun.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e7681f7a055ef00162d20a6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2574176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noël Balen","original_name":"Noël Balen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e76820fcabfe40018211ba1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1957405,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Étienne Gauthier","original_name":"Étienne Gauthier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e768261d18b2400137f16ac","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1894005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amaury Voslion","original_name":"Amaury Voslion","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7682312f3b170014509791","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2574178,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Amaury Voslion","original_name":"Amaury Voslion","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e76824c2fe2fa0016147c9b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
