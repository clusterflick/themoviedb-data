The film offers insight into the attitudes and practices of Christian missionaries of that time. Despite the colonial paternalism that underpins the Missionary Societyâ€™s model of care, the film tells the story of a happy, active community, as it follows the lives of the patients, their families and the dedicated staff, all of whom live, work and socialise on the island together.","popularity":0.329,"poster_path":"/xCGe1irK7YqpkAsjW6Ce4l9dZgN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8884,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Australia","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1958-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Happy Island","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2576166,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ann Gurr","original_name":"Ann Gurr","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e78bd74d18b240015819a0a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1349599,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"R.
