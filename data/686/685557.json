It doesn't matter if, inside the box, the cat is alive, dead or undead. It is a paradox. Still, a film about a Portuguese rock band can begin with an introduction to quantum physics, when some of these basic concepts are used as a starting point for the creative process. The director Ricardo Oliveira recorded the daydreams of recording the third album of originals by Capitão Fausto: Capitão Fausto Têm os Dias Contados. And when in one of the songs - “Corazón” - is heard at a certain point: “… Pontas soltas. Isso é comigo. E por isso queres também ser assim. Pontas soltas. Isso é comigo. Para estragar um disco tenho-me a mim…”, it is clear that the band of Tomás Wallenstein, Manuel Palha, Francisco Ferreira, Domingos Coimbra and Salvador Seabra reached the age of majority and tied such loose ends. More than a diary, it is an experience.","popularity":0.0987,"poster_path":"/fjBK8sHhVUGmvFFSnGBBnYf3qZr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2016-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Loose Ends","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2575475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomás Wallenstein","original_name":"Tomás Wallenstein","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/A0KrQd1hklmypTSXNTKma8vLTi1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e77c8d6d18b240019809123","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2575476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Domingos Coimbra","original_name":"Domingos Coimbra","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e77c8e1fea0d700135e17c7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2575477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francisco Ferreira","original_name":"Francisco Ferreira","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e77c8efb974420013d3fe31","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2575478,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salvador Seabra","original_name":"Salvador Seabra","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e77c9066f31af00172e0c63","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2575479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuel Palha","original_name":"Manuel Palha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e77c912c8a2d400132116e2","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2575480,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ricardo Oliveira","original_name":"Ricardo Oliveira","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e77c932fea0d700155e13be","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2575479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuel Palha","original_name":"Manuel Palha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fef376aecc7e8003d13680b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/fjBK8sHhVUGmvFFSnGBBnYf3qZr.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/7me2CzduQShDsdXTMr3So109XM4.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":900},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1195,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/b86jMz6VwrOCI9iFCAf1Hwf3R42.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":797},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/4lL3JaEO7O6nm50rIs3QVociiyu.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TRAILER \"PONTAS SOLTAS\"","key":"190099084","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-11-03T14:15:28.000Z","id":"5e77ca46cabfe40011222412"}]}}}
