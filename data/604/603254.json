Gorriarena dies and his work begins an existence where the author is not there to explain it, replace it or modify it. The mounting of an exhibition is the excuse to explore both material and ideological decisions that coexist in the work of an artist. The film explores some of these decisions and their results, trying to show which gestures of love, trust, order, admiration or greed it arouses, and in the process tries to find the painter's way and perhaps, only perhaps, to get closer to his truth. A truth that is expressed through colour, critical and biting realism, ironic denunciation and energetic resistance to being \"accused\" of being a political and social painter.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2010-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gorri","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1360755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carmen Guarini","original_name":"Carmen Guarini","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce0a9c50e0a2657f9c99215","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema","release_date":"2010-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
