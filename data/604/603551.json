Director Juan-Carlos Asse takes five subjects from his hometown that all suffer from common health issues and puts them on regimen of a plant based diet and exercise for six weeks. The results are impressive as the five people quickly turn their health around in the six-week period. Asse tests the 5 subjects with many exciting physical challenges throughout the film. The film showcases cooking skills, healthy shopping, eating healthy on the road, and mental fortitude. An interesting twist occurs when Asse reveals his own trials and tribulations including a seven-year federal prison sentence... leading him to true freedom.","popularity":0.3502,"poster_path":"/i0og3lHmUHjNMU0hcULOyqiXjpa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unsupersize Us","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1512266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan-Carlos Asse","original_name":"Juan-Carlos Asse","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5da80227944a57001524ac77","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1512266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan-Carlos Asse","original_name":"Juan-Carlos Asse","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5da80288e6d3cc0018af26f4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1512266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan-Carlos Asse","original_name":"Juan-Carlos Asse","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5da8029170309f001264c90b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1512266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan-Carlos Asse","original_name":"Juan-Carlos Asse","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5da800a070309f0014648780","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2434577,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Carlon Lyken","original_name":"Carlon Lyken","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5da802a2e6d3cc0018af273b","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1512266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan-Carlos Asse","original_name":"Juan-Carlos Asse","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5da80278e6d3cc0018af26d1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6294950","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yboekIxbrmC2vMmuRlTjdybYV2m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/i0og3lHmUHjNMU0hcULOyqiXjpa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3429,"name":"diet"},{"id":3721,"name":"health"},{"id":175322,"name":"vegan"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Unsupersize Us  Official Trailer","key":"0nN2hYZfkLw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-02-04T02:01:13.000Z","id":"5da7ff5f70309f0014648506"}]}}}
