The performances were held in temporary “non-places” of undetermined statuses. These areas became filled with unwanted music – unpleasant noise driven out of urban spaces. The premise behind the film project involved seeking new contexts for marginal sound; the consecutive segments-concerts made up a tale of man’s acting in a space, while the noise generated by the artists became a metaphor of man’s interference with the environment.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reverberation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2317259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sebastian Harmazy","original_name":"Sebastian Harmazy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"VILGOĆ","credit_id":"5ce2c8f39251412cecbd708c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2317260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergei Khanolaynen","original_name":"Sergei Khanolaynen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"MAAAA","credit_id":"5ce2c8fec3a36809ec1f99f0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2317261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dawid Kowalski","original_name":"Dawid Kowalski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"PURGIST","credit_id":"5ce2c90d9251415430b9ef89","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2317262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Konrad Materek","original_name":"Konrad Materek","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"REZ EPO","credit_id":"5ce2c9180e0a266f81cf79ea","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2317264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Skrzyński","original_name":"Robert Skrzyński","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"MICROMELANCOLIÉ","credit_id":"5ce2c9239251412ce1bd981c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2317265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bartosz Zaskórski","original_name":"Bartosz Zaskórski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"MCHY I POROSTY","credit_id":"5ce2c92fc3a368451120eaac","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2317258,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Radek Sirko","original_name":"Radek Sirko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce2c8789251412ce1bd9653","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2317258,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Radek Sirko","original_name":"Radek Sirko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce2c8850e0a265256cf067c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
