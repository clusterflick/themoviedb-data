Despite claims of erasing “everything but the clouds,” there is no erasure. This video documents the history of Super Mario Clouds and demonstrates LeMieux's own attempt to “erase everything but the clouds,” producing a different game altogether.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/qIIwDBNyOvVfDCtd6CyEEJKn1Cx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everything But the Clouds","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2315932,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick LeMieux","original_name":"Patrick LeMieux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ce072610e0a264a92cb5810","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2315932,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick LeMieux","original_name":"Patrick LeMieux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce072540e0a264a92cb580a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1593,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qIIwDBNyOvVfDCtd6CyEEJKn1Cx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1062}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
