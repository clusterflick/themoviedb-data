In the spirit of Bertolt Brecht´s theory of art and distanciation, Khazarian frees himself from reality, combining in the film amateur films about his own family and contemporary footage from the battlefield in Nagorno-Karabakh. His film is not a recapitulation of historical fact, but rather a visual meditation on the fetishist aesthetics of war, diverse sexual orientations and the consequences of emigration. The film deals with topics such as war, destruction and sexuality, which, in the director´s view are indissolubly linked.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Love the Sound of the Kalachnikov It Reminds Me of Tchaikovsky","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2317183,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philippe Vartan Khazarian","original_name":"Philippe Vartan Khazarian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce2abb4c3a368190422c40e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2294864","wikidata_id":"Q16252586","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Rotterdam International Film Festival","release_date":"2001-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
