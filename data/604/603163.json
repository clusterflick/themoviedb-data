Manning, a cowboy, suspects Chandler's motives, and his suspicions are strengthened when Chandler is caught cheating at cards. Following a gang of Mexicans to their mountain retreat, Manning learns that Chandler and the Mexicans are smuggling opium across the border. Two gang members are killed in the ensuing fight, but Chandler, wounded by Manning after a chase on the cliffs, escapes to Jo's home, where he denounces Manning as a smuggler. Manning arrives and dispels Jo's misgivings about him by revealing that he is a Texas Ranger, sworn to secrecy.","popularity":0.1125,"poster_path":"/6b4vaua4pTtFexhYM1OexJJPyUW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83304,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aywon Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1920-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Unknown Ranger","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2315838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rex Ray","original_name":"Rex Ray","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Buck Manning","credit_id":"5ce03606c3a36819041f0d8a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2315839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Hill","original_name":"Ben Hill","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"John Chandler","credit_id":"5ce036209251412ce1b9ce37","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2315840,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Newall","original_name":"Marie Newall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jo Blair","credit_id":"5ce036380e0a266f89cb5d2d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1718994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harris Gordon","original_name":"Harris Gordon","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/2fvLyYeQ4ImrdZKW5J150BN1Net.jpg","credit_id":"61acfb8a15dea00041701e2a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0202648","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6b4vaua4pTtFexhYM1OexJJPyUW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1920-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
