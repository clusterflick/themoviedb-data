His intensely sad father, a restorer of paintings, is not able to offer him any solace. Maurits denies his mother's death and withdraws to the flood plains of the river. There he meets Moniek. During their journey of discovery through the plains, their tender friendship turns into love. But Maurits anger and sorrow sometimes turn to extreme emotions and that frightens Moniek. A dead dog takes them over the top and Moniek never wants to see him again.","popularity":0.1808,"poster_path":"/mXWVgetidNtVZl1YtyFDGhf4epw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blazen tot honderd","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Dandelion Game","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olivier Tuinier","original_name":"Olivier Tuinier","popularity":0.055,"profile_path":"/5LpTtsgIeCz07kOhpZLCLoahNCv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Maurits","credit_id":"5ce328639251412ce1be3ee4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":105979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Vinck","original_name":"Marie Vinck","popularity":0.3016,"profile_path":"/4KvxQvdJmca7vas4EQgsYMEMp3I.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Moniek","credit_id":"5ce328710e0a263f91cb72c3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert Flack","original_name":"Herbert Flack","popularity":0.0564,"profile_path":"/ruJXheeI6YsIEImZ4VaKmZaBn82.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Father","credit_id":"5ce3287e0e0a266f89d0537b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":48178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hilde Van Mieghem","original_name":"Hilde Van Mieghem","popularity":0.1947,"profile_path":"/77U2HyU8msuqpqduOac4adPdKd.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"5ce3288c9251412cfabe2f81","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wouter ten Pas","original_name":"Wouter ten Pas","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5ce3289b9251412d00be7525","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dora van der Groen","original_name":"Dora van der Groen","popularity":0.0568,"profile_path":"/q5r8a9p3bdbQqRZR5ohHNJw15y1.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5ce328a7c3a36823c52438a4","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1872719,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter van Wijk","original_name":"Peter van Wijk","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce327f80e0a265256cfc2a0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0118737","wikidata_id":"Q2689373","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.694,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bgvNk7KU0GjKAQV7DqQXZKfRhlc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":694},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/mXWVgetidNtVZl1YtyFDGhf4epw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"1998-05-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
