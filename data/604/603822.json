What is she looking for?  What will she encounter?  Rural life in the era of globa­li­sa­tion turns into an adven­ture.  History lives in objects, stories and customs here since it was first recorded 800 years ago.  Wars and famines have left their traces, just as churches, poli­tical parties and various forms of govern­ment.  The change of the times, struc­tured by tele­vi­sion, has almost obscu­rely changed the old rhythms of life; super­market offers changed eating habits and food stock economy.  Is it folk­lore nost­algia or a matter of preser­ving one’s way and quality of life to keep the old customs and habits, such as preser­ving old types of plants and boiling down cucum­bers?  The village -  a mutual exch­ange of expe­ri­ences and garden products.  The village is like an onion:  it shows ever new surpri­sing layers and leads us deep into unwritten pasts.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":75520,"logo_path":null,"name":"Helke Sander Filmproduktion","origin_country":""},{"id":588,"logo_path":"/6mWg9rdVSj8gwgMiOmZH4iBCcMm.png","name":"MDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2001-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dorf","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":64520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helke Sander","original_name":"Helke Sander","popularity":0.0558,"profile_path":"/kQxvb6MV0rYkrU1bcTs0v6n0Ao4.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62084059945d3600659c71d5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1606939,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roswitha Ziegler","original_name":"Roswitha Ziegler","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c5caeba93d25001c246a70","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1978460,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gerhard Ziegler","original_name":"Gerhard Ziegler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c5cafa63a6950041688f94","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3357343,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Barbara Milde","original_name":"Barbara Milde","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c5cb1948333a0042928e40","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":64520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helke Sander","original_name":"Helke Sander","popularity":0.0558,"profile_path":"/kQxvb6MV0rYkrU1bcTs0v6n0Ao4.jpg","credit_id":"61c5cb27a93d2500413e6b55","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1745245,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Roland Musolff","original_name":"Roland Musolff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c5cb3a19ab590041e01e12","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1298658,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ulrike Zimmermann","original_name":"Ulrike Zimmermann","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c5cb7933ad8f001fb11854","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":64520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helke Sander","original_name":"Helke Sander","popularity":0.0558,"profile_path":"/kQxvb6MV0rYkrU1bcTs0v6n0Ao4.jpg","credit_id":"5ce3e1c40e0a265779ca8d82","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":64520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helke Sander","original_name":"Helke Sander","popularity":0.0558,"profile_path":"/kQxvb6MV0rYkrU1bcTs0v6n0Ao4.jpg","credit_id":"5ce3e1e6c3a3686a1c1eaa98","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":64520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helke Sander","original_name":"Helke Sander","popularity":0.0558,"profile_path":"/kQxvb6MV0rYkrU1bcTs0v6n0Ao4.jpg","credit_id":"5ce3e1f192514179f4b86cdf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0345146","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
