When James Bennett hears of this, he insists that Baird do something to make his fortune before he can marry his daughter Ruth. Bennett begins by using the car to start a jitney-bus line. This is not terribly impressive to Bennett -- who owns a trolley company -- and he decides he would rather see Ruth married to his controller, William Mott-Smith.","popularity":0.3575,"poster_path":"/wKydv03h6z8AV7VbM7mzQd7dY8K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88999,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bluebird Photoplays","origin_country":"US"},{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Car of Chance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":975597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franklyn Farnum","original_name":"Franklyn Farnum","popularity":0.4916,"profile_path":"/tE9xlvLgA04icdBTe7rjqgt8c2E.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Arnold Baird","credit_id":"5ce348e8c3a36863a81dcef9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1188099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agnes Vernon","original_name":"Agnes Vernon","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/kzGDvQv2h8eNt6DWg85Gfmsy8gd.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Ruth Rennett","credit_id":"5ce348eec3a36809ec208b94","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1329604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Wright","original_name":"Helen Wright","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/nNZ8BKDZHdg47DefXffbxXWMjrq.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mrs. Bennett","credit_id":"5ce348f6c3a36864941dd2a2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":120641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Molly Malone","original_name":"Molly Malone","popularity":0.2069,"profile_path":"/kyP1EXUZxmupWy54heS2MLbug7l.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Wanda Heimstone","credit_id":"5ce349429251414a92b82c79","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1014296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Fenton","original_name":"Mark Fenton","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"James Bennett","credit_id":"5ce349489251414902b82d4b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2317653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"H.J.
