Faced with a post-revolution backlash against the LGBTQ community, they escape Cairo to seek asylum and acceptance in the Netherlands. An accompanying installation allows audiences to reflect on what they have seen, heard, and felt in VR.  Another Dream is the second installment of Queer In A Time Of Forced Migration, an animated transmedia series that follows the stories of LGBTQ refugees from Egypt, Sudan, and Saudi Arabia, and from the 2011 revolutions in the Middle East and North Africa region.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/5jW49ii1mI6BRAWxPLlAe1q7m7F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65759,"logo_path":"/v68WzGMTPZsWKjwtHWvMiAYNxDZ.png","name":"Ado Ato Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","name":"Egypt"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Another Dream","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1523284,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tamara Shogaolu","original_name":"Tamara Shogaolu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce2da289251413e65ba03b4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2317325,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Marijn Karsten","original_name":"Marijn Karsten","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce2da67c3a368469d242192","department":"Visual Effects","job":"3D Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1523284,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tamara Shogaolu","original_name":"Tamara Shogaolu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce2da4dc3a368469d24217f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2317322,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lauren Dubowski","original_name":"Lauren Dubowski","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce2da31c3a3685090214947","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2197054,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Natalya Sarch","original_name":"Natalya Sarch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce2da3dc3a36823c523a1c9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1523284,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tamara Shogaolu","original_name":"Tamara Shogaolu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce2da1b92514150a1bd7ae4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2317327,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Gata Mahardika","original_name":"Gata Mahardika","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce2da7fc3a3684c1c214571","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Lead Animator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2317322,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lauren Dubowski","original_name":"Lauren Dubowski","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce2da550e0a266f86cf6da4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10245754","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tmqm2tDpcAKLO0ibK4qwg4Y72zP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5jW49ii1mI6BRAWxPLlAe1q7m7F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1131}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"SÃ£o Paulo International Film Festival","release_date":"2019-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Tribeca Film Festival","release_date":"2019-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
