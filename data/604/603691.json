The \"father\" side of his nature manifests itself on the college football field, where Henry excels. Unfortunately, the \"mother\" side is evidenced by a streak of cowardice, which surfaces at all the wrong times. Hoping to expunge the cowardly part of his make-up, Henry hires a bunch of self-styled mentalists to \"concentrate\" his problems away. Pretty soon, Henry is a virtual slave to the whims of the mentalists, who push his emotional buttons with reckless abandon.","popularity":0.3646,"poster_path":"/3YlvPrhWCZvdGamTxjIFb4h7Wnj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88999,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bluebird Photoplays","origin_country":"US"},{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brace Up","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert Rawlinson","original_name":"Herbert Rawlinson","popularity":0.2357,"profile_path":"/siWyKk2R5OfDhdJHYtlAPdYuXAc.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Henry Court","credit_id":"5ce32f5a9251413e65ba9928","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":68653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Du Brey","original_name":"Claire Du Brey","popularity":0.3502,"profile_path":"/e8WDoA2IhvjkFMZ2OEsr7PinZEe.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Ellen Miles","credit_id":"5ce32f60c3a36811ee2010f5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":994615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred Allen","original_name":"Alfred Allen","popularity":0.2206,"profile_path":"/9UK19FDQYBqYwJ5JBirpaeLsHw6.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Col.
