She is considered a suspicious character and thrown into jail. Kurt Walters, a ranch foreman and deputy sheriff, discovers that she is the same girl that his friend, Jo Gary, met in Chicago. Gary fell in love with her, but she confessed she was a thief. Since Penny claims she wants to reform, Walters releases her and sends her to live with Mrs. Kingdon. In spite of her teasing and taunts (or perhaps because of them), Walters finds himself falling in love with Penny.","popularity":0.2786,"poster_path":"/da9G6iSf9BbJWUTqj7nunqd7avh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40362,"logo_path":null,"name":"Andrew J.
