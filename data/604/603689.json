Powerful interviews with feminist leaders including bell hooks, Gloria Steinem, and Urvsahi Vaid are intercut with documentary sequences to engagingly explore the past and present status of the women’s movement. Discussing the unique contributions of second wave feminism, they explore their racial, economic and ideological differences and shared vision of achieving equality for women. Anessential component of women’s studies curricula, My Feminism introduces feminism’s key themeswhile exposing the cultural fears underlying lesbian baiting, backlash, and political extremism.","popularity":0.4363,"poster_path":"/gkR7DNlqUFAAwDpkY1730r8aoEx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Feminism","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":176027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gloria Steinem","original_name":"Gloria Steinem","popularity":0.2119,"profile_path":"/7MjgrZjTlG9V4kwdzV2igvoImAr.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61d51ea4e10f460067759ccc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":547962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"bell hooks","original_name":"bell hooks","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61d51e8a12197e00416e0005","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3370262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Becker","original_name":"Mary Becker","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61d51ecba22d3e0067b71138","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3370263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Urvashi Butalia","original_name":"Urvashi Butalia","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61d51ed912197e008bbad9e3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2651941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judy Rebick","original_name":"Judy Rebick","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61d51ef01b722c004132479f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2654145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ailbhe Smyth","original_name":"Ailbhe Smyth","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61d51f0212197e008bbada58","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3143277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Urvashi Vaid","original_name":"Urvashi Vaid","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61d51f16a22d3e001da603b7","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498513,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nick Hector","original_name":"Nick Hector","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":"/gtgBIbIU01FfEduOI0y1TRlnLN2.jpg","credit_id":"642a211d0f365500d27aac0e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1142962,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominique Cardona","original_name":"Dominique Cardona","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce32c129251412cfabe3501","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1142963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurie Colbert","original_name":"Laurie Colbert","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce32c1c0e0a263f91cb78e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0160554","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.694,"height":2166,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gkR7DNlqUFAAwDpkY1730r8aoEx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1503}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":212915,"name":"women's rights"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
