The film was required to be completely original, under five minutes in length, and include the line \"I know how this ends.\" The film takes place, largely, in the mind of the main character, who is in a coma. In his coma-induced dream, he can hear what is actually going on around him in the hospital, but he is unconscious, and blends reality with the serial playing on the radio.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/nfXZCZp7MHyDOkueRZPkRAcnCvL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118627,"logo_path":null,"name":"Your Friendly Neighborhood Film Crew","origin_country":""},{"id":117730,"logo_path":null,"name":"ME Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"I know how this ends","title":"In the Hours of Darkness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2299466,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Emma Bauer","original_name":"Emma Bauer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Elizabeth / Ms. Adner","credit_id":"5ce2fa9d0e0a265256cf665b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2303531,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leah Kaliski","original_name":"Leah Kaliski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Frank Miller / Narrator","credit_id":"5ce2fab8c3a3684c1c21889a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2299464,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Clare Swanson","original_name":"Clare Swanson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Radio Host","credit_id":"5ce2fac90e0a265256cf66c6","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2303528,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evan Koppers","original_name":"Evan Koppers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce2faeb9251415430ba452f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2303528,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evan Koppers","original_name":"Evan Koppers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce2fafc0e0a265256cf67ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nfXZCZp7MHyDOkueRZPkRAcnCvL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
