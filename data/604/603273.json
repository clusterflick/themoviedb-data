It consists of a camera with a trigger -- when the trigger is stepped on by a passing animal, a flash goes off and the camera shoots the picture. Lane goes up to the mountains to try out his new contraption. When a recluse refuses to let him spend the night in his cabin, Lane goes to sleep out of doors, with the camera set up near by. In the middle of the night, he is awakened by the flash and the sound of gunshots. Trekking back to his own cabin the next day, he develops the picture, which is of a girl holding a rifle. He returns to the recluse's cabin where he is arrested for murder.","popularity":0.2422,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":88999,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bluebird Photoplays","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Flashlight","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1196077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Phillips","original_name":"Dorothy Phillips","popularity":0.1,"profile_path":"/f9z3iAAzrKWjRkWlQ9V47tPsZi8.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Delice Brixton","credit_id":"5ce0cf870e0a26278ec9b307","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1196078,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Stowell","original_name":"William Stowell","popularity":0.156,"profile_path":"/fYVk4U0LqoHVWFhnT6UDO3hkqPL.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jack Lane","credit_id":"5ce0cf8ec3a368469d209611","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lon Chaney","original_name":"Lon Chaney","popularity":0.3652,"profile_path":"/m1icBooBEqFNp24Puu7qXn2Sarr.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Henry Norton / Porter Brixton","credit_id":"5ce0cf969251412ce1baa38f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":994615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred Allen","original_name":"Alfred Allen","popularity":0.2206,"profile_path":"/9UK19FDQYBqYwJ5JBirpaeLsHw6.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"John Peterson","credit_id":"5ce0cfa1c3a36814e4202128","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1282389,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Berrell","original_name":"George Berrell","popularity":0.083,"profile_path":"/qTaiMJQ8BJrZPAPSAJA6GkoLzMh.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Barclay (as George Burrell)","credit_id":"5ce0cfa80e0a265256cbf200","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1031882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evelyn Selbie","original_name":"Evelyn Selbie","popularity":0.1514,"profile_path":"/l75Ol7KP1ku0K8ErZ46qW7bjWag.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Mrs. Barclay","credit_id":"5ce0cfaec3a3684c1c1df025","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1505437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clyde Benson","original_name":"Clyde Benson","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Deputy","credit_id":"5ce0cfb4925141486aba59d8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2316106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Orin Jackson","original_name":"Orin Jackson","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Howard, Jack Lane's servant (as O.C.
