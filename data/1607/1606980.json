After receiving a camcorder for his Bar Mitzvah, Frank decides to make his own film, Zombie. \"It's not a horror movie,\" he explains. \"It's a murder mystery. It's Hitchcockian.\" But as Frank labors away on Zombie, he increasingly neglects everything else, including his friends, family, and personal well-being. Featuring music by Ted Leo and the Pharmacists, Movie Boy is a bittersweet coming-of-age story about passion, youth, and the love of movies.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Movie Boy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1061049,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Lefkovitz","original_name":"Jon Lefkovitz","popularity":0.311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69543e471a8f746b7788e7fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
