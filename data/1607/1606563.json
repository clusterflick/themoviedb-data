Have you ever considered what happens in the body to make use of all those grains, meats, and vegetablesplus all those fun sweets? Did you know that your stomach produces hydrochloric acid, and your colon harbors more than 400 distinct species of helpful bacteria? The adult digestive system is amazing. The digestive tract itself is 2030 feet long. It takes about two hours for food to be rhythmically propelled through this system, during which carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, and water pass through the intestinal wall and into the bloodstream. Accessory glands such as the pancreas, liver, and salivary glands aid in the digestive process and the utilization of food to make the fuel that the body uses for growth and metabolism.
