From the first shot at the Cactus Car Wash to the unusual travel tip offered to Martin at the Atlanta Steeple Chase six months later. Psychobillys, tailgate partiers, roller derby teams, art collectors and gamblers...Martin Parr's energy and x-ray vision burn through the South like a modern day William Hogarth's. The film features interviews with Susan Meiselas, Philip Gefter, John Gossage and Julian Cox. Hot Spots shows us Martin Parr at his most outrageous.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ogouomTfmCcAs4yhwErEDVzNXQv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143150,"logo_path":null,"name":"One Production Place","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"See Atlanta as you've never seen it before.","title":"HOT SPOTS: Martin Parr in the American South","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1318964,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Parr","original_name":"Martin Parr","popularity":0.3964,"profile_path":"/jD786EQJyAlt0jggvcnNhmFDYZO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"69544950e73b0ed169cbdece","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1459328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Neal Broffman","original_name":"Neal Broffman","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695449781c52822d3bcbe1e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1459328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Neal Broffman","original_name":"Neal Broffman","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6954498d89479ab8967c7c65","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1459328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Neal Broffman","original_name":"Neal Broffman","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6954499ef79bd0c6b674ee90","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2574048,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elisa Gambino","original_name":"Elisa Gambino","popularity":0.3968,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695449c0bf538b7f4fd7a218","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5907988,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Carlton Eden","original_name":"Carlton Eden","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695449e91f7f558045e4204e","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006691,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Patrick Kirst","original_name":"Patrick Kirst","popularity":0.2104,"profile_path":"/9B0sK1b6BdHZVrflsYj6lkRbRcP.jpg","credit_id":"69544a1b5c26d942aa7101e4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3076102","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ogouomTfmCcAs4yhwErEDVzNXQv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6025,"name":"photography"},{"id":2076,"name":"atlanta"},{"id":174109,"name":"documentary filmmaking"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
