Jahrhunderts","overview":"Compilation film with excerpts from Thomas Schadt's own films (1982–2000). The decontextualization into 20 miniatures makes it particularly clear that Thomas Schadt already had an eye for the comedy of male hubris in his earlier work. The film often deals with competition and megalomania, with the awareness of naturally possessing the power to define. But time and again, he also portrays with great empathy the lostness of those who are not among the winners.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Männerbilder des späten 20.
