Through rare, high-quality archival footage, the film explores three generations of stadiums—from the original 1923 construction and the massive rallies of the 1930s to the \"Golden Era\" of 1. FC Köln in the 1960s.  The film also provides an exclusive \"Making Of\" look at the modern RheinEnergieStadion, documenting the demolition of the old arena and the two-year construction process leading up to the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Featuring commentary from the builders themselves and legendary figures like Hennes Weisweiler and Lukas Podolski, it is a definitive cinematic tribute to one of Germany's most historic sporting landmarks.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Stadium Story: Cologne-Müngersdorf","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
