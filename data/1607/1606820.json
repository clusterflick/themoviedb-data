Rose prepares her biggest show for a prestigious theater and recruits biologist Shandra to join her troupe. Shandra's smitten colleague Dana insinuates himself into the bargain by supplying the band with music he's composed from DNA. In a heady dance to the opening curtain Rose meets Brother Hugh, a biology and ethics teacher, in an online chat room and they blithely launch an experiment in romantic tragedy; the theater management plots against Rose's company; and the lives and loves of her colleagues play to the insistent backbeat of human nature. This unprecedented feature takes an intellectual twist, ambitiously wringing ethics, religion, science, and love into an inquisitive romance that puts flesh on the premise: It takes a rockin' scientist to sing a modern love song.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/eHiS1F2Zf5fJIswoPHDiQ077dc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It takes a rockin' scientist to sing a modern love song...","title":"The Singing Biologist","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5711111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Imani Coppola","original_name":"Imani Coppola","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Rose","credit_id":"6953f75774b02cdd3988ea84","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":107508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leenya Rideout","original_name":"Leenya Rideout","popularity":1.2405,"profile_path":"/qJVF60Ip6ACxbDzV7nyjexSSwAK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Shandra","credit_id":"6953f76d3afd2674bc7100f0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1520077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Kilcullen","original_name":"Stephen Kilcullen","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Dana","credit_id":"6953f77929360dcc034adda3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1749173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reade Kelly","original_name":"Reade Kelly","popularity":0.3122,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Hugh","credit_id":"6953f7857b908a3b1dcbdc73","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3778670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noel Robichaux","original_name":"Noel Robichaux","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Oskar","credit_id":"6953f7911c52822d3bcbe01d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5907317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justice Dx","original_name":"Justice Dx","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Alfonso","credit_id":"6953f79fbf4a3fbe834adb8b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1028998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Nelson","original_name":"Rebecca Nelson","popularity":0.2287,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Jennifer","credit_id":"6953f7afa41d97424f74ec40","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":187683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fenton Lawless","original_name":"Fenton Lawless","popularity":0.4265,"profile_path":"/w43Cq1bDAPKTWfBuXr5kaJbr1P7.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Jack","credit_id":"6953f7baa5dc163eac7c7df6","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3333633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cooper Moore","original_name":"Cooper Moore","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Cooper","credit_id":"6953f7c9b0d00ceac17c7aac","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":238741,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ed Montgomery","original_name":"Ed Montgomery","popularity":0.1417,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6953f7e074b02cdd3988ea8e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":2713888,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ed Montgomery","original_name":"Ed Montgomery","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6953f7ef198abab033d7a29d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1222507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terry Bisson","original_name":"Terry Bisson","popularity":0.1548,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6953f7fcb0d00ceac17c7ab2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":238741,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ed Montgomery","original_name":"Ed Montgomery","popularity":0.1417,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6953f80fcd4b4945b988e72b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3199077,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Naama Pyritz","original_name":"Naama Pyritz","popularity":0.0998,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6953f81ce4d7d287f5c3839f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1207493,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ann T.
