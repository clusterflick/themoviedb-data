Now, for the first time since they began being constructed around 60 years ago, decisions must be made about how to dispose of them. In his short film, director Karl Lemieux explores the issue of offshore oil rigs, and specifically the oil rig graveyard in Scotland’s Cromarty Firth. In the film, shot on 16 mm and videotape, Lemieux uses photochemical manipulation and image processing to expose what some wish to hide. At a time when human civilization is supposed to be transitioning to renewable energies, this project asks questions about what we will do with the monumental remains of our old energy sources.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Plateformes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1375819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karl Lemieux","original_name":"Karl Lemieux","popularity":0.1831,"profile_path":"/jOeSFKyTcESAi8QMgVLItkRoZf5.jpg","credit_id":"6953e03aa993119b6de41b99","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1740988,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nathalie Cloutier","original_name":"Nathalie Cloutier","popularity":0.185,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6953e057b5a62664a7cbdc2a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2799263,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mélanie Brière","original_name":"Mélanie Brière","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6953e067a24bd97c0a7c7bfa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
