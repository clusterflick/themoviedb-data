It literally means from 'Door to Door' and used to signify someone who has no Home, one who is roaming one place to another, hoping for a Refuge. In simple words- Homeless or Displaced. It's a story of two strangers displaced from home, who meet in a foreign city which is nobody's home. A story lived through the travelling eyes of an afghan driver displaced from his motherland and an Indian actor searching for his identity, how history, art and cinema brings them together leaving an ever lasting impact on each other before they bid good bye.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/6nYFkYwjYy1IQJdnzgiOdoPxNqe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":284751,"logo_path":null,"name":"Glamour
