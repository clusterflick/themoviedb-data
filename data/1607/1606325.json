Their starting point is Yakutsk, the capital of Russia's largest federal republic. Here in Sakha, the Republic of the Yakuts, the harshest frosts prevail, with temperatures as low as -60°C and even colder. The earth is frozen many meters deep and only thaws on the surface in summer. Kostya and Lyosha are driving a Russian Ural truck. The journey is fraught with danger, especially on the Verkhoyansk mountain range, which rises to over 1,200 meters. Although the mountains appear beautiful under a bright sun and with excellent visibility, and a cleared road even leads over the pass, this is precisely where many accidents occur every year, and this time is no exception. And even after that, the conditions remain treacherous – hundreds of kilometers of unpredictable ice desert await them.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":284698,"logo_path":null,"name":"Medienkontor Postdam Gmbh","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sibirien, die Eisstraße ins Polarmeer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3341979,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wolfgang Mertin","original_name":"Wolfgang Mertin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6952fe8ccc4c9e73274adaf8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3341979,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wolfgang Mertin","original_name":"Wolfgang Mertin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6952fe9fc754922da1cbd797","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Siberia, the Polar Road to the Polar Sea (360° - GEO Reportage)","key":"S7VcirrE2xc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-09-15T17:00:04.000Z","id":"6952ff53b5a62664a7cbd799"}]}}}
