Here her life proves anything but happy. Denied the pleasures enjoyed by most girls of her age, she endures her husband's cold severity as long as possible and then leaves him, returning to America, where she visits her old school friend, Letitia Proudfoot. It is while attending a reception with Letitia that she meets the poet, Forrest Smith, whose attentions are welcome after the austerity of the frigid Ferdinand.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/sIvz72A6LrZ4Ap3OCnOUzilPIza.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36472,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hobart Bosworth Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":37554,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oliver Morosco Photoplay Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pretty Mrs. Smith","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2253475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fritzi Scheff","original_name":"Fritzi Scheff","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Pretty Mrs. Drucilla Smith","credit_id":"69531d8adb151d9ef84adaa5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1755542,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Bennison","original_name":"Louis Bennison","popularity":0.1865,"profile_path":"/YyPhY9vYjCG242XGLJEBfdjl5v.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mr. Smith No. 1, Ferdinand","credit_id":"69531db5b5a62664a7cbd835","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Forrest Stanley","original_name":"Forrest Stanley","popularity":0.3015,"profile_path":"/3OUSDzqlX2Hqz2hRxwXbrTwObNK.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mr. Smith No. 2, Forrest","credit_id":"69531e05a41d97424f74e83e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Owen Moore","original_name":"Owen Moore","popularity":0.6939,"profile_path":"/6iBzyALpUaf22lKD2kRgzmsHGuC.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mr. Smith No. 3, Frank","credit_id":"69531e11b112fd556de41986","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":130098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lela Bliss","original_name":"Lela Bliss","popularity":0.4082,"profile_path":"/4z9HblAM7UCYakqgcFU9gYEMIAI.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Letitia Proudfoot","credit_id":"69531e205c26d942aa70fd23","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592840,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Art Acord","original_name":"Art Acord","popularity":0.5542,"profile_path":"/oQkLrz7mdwkawVQE9KtMTM7ydDL.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"69531e65aee9f647a474e961","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hobart Bosworth","original_name":"Hobart Bosworth","popularity":0.3932,"profile_path":"/embweEOzbEdv3FgNikIgv6ZoTS1.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"69531e70032ef594a174e884","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hobart Bosworth","original_name":"Hobart Bosworth","popularity":0.3932,"profile_path":"/embweEOzbEdv3FgNikIgv6ZoTS1.jpg","credit_id":"69531e828a5a5bc08b74eab0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George W.
