In the 2010 revival, he made history by taking on the baritone title role, one of Verdi’s most fascinating characters, and thrilling audiences with his multifaceted and gripping portrayal. Boccanegra is beset on all sides, juggling political adversaries bent on murder with his love for his long-lost daughter Amelia (Adrianne Pieczonka). James Levine’s conducting brings out all the color and surging emotion of Verdi’s magnificent score.","popularity":0.2734,"poster_path":"/wG8lsDbBYqpj7j3rmge1aBIKDEk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15005,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Metropolitan Opera","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Simon Boccanegra [The Metropolitan Opera]","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Plácido Domingo","original_name":"Plácido Domingo","popularity":0.342,"profile_path":"/r0OUJ630b7dllOFBQ4SElP3XnpC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Simon Boccanegra","credit_id":"65187edc93bd6900acc6e7a2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1371254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adrianne Pieczonka","original_name":"Adrianne Pieczonka","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/5uEi2XCqXAWHKUdeekivtDqs4tz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Amelia","credit_id":"65187ee993bd6900e12dcdbc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":483592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcello Giordani","original_name":"Marcello Giordani","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":"/dtEzmtKEqUtBxUEpFQBKpJg843T.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gabriele Adorno","credit_id":"65187efaea84c7014efb9b65","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":432628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Morris","original_name":"James Morris","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/1YYYRhX4X1Z8MrRgBa88dpLTm9X.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jacopo Fiesto","credit_id":"65187f1596e30b011e078076","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1248678,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"James Levine","original_name":"James Levine","popularity":0.1985,"profile_path":"/p6ujBSZMKTc2zNCytIvvg9NKL1D.jpg","credit_id":"65187f5793bd69011b8dc710","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093378,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arrigo Boito","original_name":"Arrigo Boito","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65187f9b96e30b013b151f49","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140807,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Francesco Maria Piave","original_name":"Francesco Maria Piave","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65187fac96e30b00e334f478","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":100226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giancarlo Del Monaco","original_name":"Giancarlo Del Monaco","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65187f6c967cc73426091a42","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2923063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"MET Orchestra","original_name":"MET Orchestra","popularity":0.0984,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65187f77967cc73428cae8ec","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15130,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giuseppe Verdi","original_name":"Giuseppe Verdi","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":"/3W2HAqexkcpK6mWG3vseRlhD1ep.jpg","credit_id":"65187f4cea84c700aee9ab3c","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1671204","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":764,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6orWOKTrvjlRo8RdidaI8AOMzHM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1358}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1526,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wG8lsDbBYqpj7j3rmge1aBIKDEk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1018}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
