In a small house on the ground floor, where the noise of local traffic echoes, live Ester and her husband Richard Benson. Well-known face of the Italian show, now disgraced. \"Hello everyone, I’m Richard Benson and I’m sick. I can’t afford medicine so I appeal to all my fans, because today I risk dying\". These words that the artist releases on RepubblicaTV, in a short time make the rounds of the Italian media. In the message he boasts to be one of the fastest guitarists in the world, to have had collaborations with international artists of the Rock and Metal scene, and to have done over 10,000 concerts over the years. It must be because of his shock statement, or because of the battered look he would never think of such a successful past. But for those who hear about it for the first time, the question arises: \"Who the hell is Richard Benson?!\"","popularity":0.1845,"poster_path":"/5bfEfNmUZxMVWyeFA8DSmtppAYy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129312,"logo_path":null,"name":"Piano
