In a possible future, a group of those-who-were-left-behind (or, those-who-chose-to-stay) have made a home inside the body of a whale. They find themselves contemplating this new world and speculating on the state of things outside – a world ravaged by a climate crisis which they survived by turning to the ocean. At a crossing between the present day and this potential future, a lone figure sings a lament for the body of the world’s last whale.","popularity":0.115,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deep in the Eye and the Belly","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2330634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nando Messias","original_name":"Nando Messias","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"651817b29d592c0122169f2a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2894939,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Williams","original_name":"Sam Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65181749a199a600ab191053","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2894939,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Williams","original_name":"Sam Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651817cba199a600fe76008e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4298778,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Max Allen","original_name":"Max Allen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6518180b9d592c0102bf7fa4","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2136606,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alexandra Boanta","original_name":"Alexandra Boanta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6518182393bd69011b8da914","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32804,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simon Fisher-Turner","original_name":"Simon Fisher-Turner","popularity":0.095,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651817e39d592c0122169f3c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4298776,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Priya Palak","original_name":"Priya Palak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651817f99d592c0122169f51","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2894939,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Williams","original_name":"Sam Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651817d6967cc73425efa4ce","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"San Mei Gallery, London","release_date":"2023-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
