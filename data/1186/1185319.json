A few years later, trespassing what had been taboo until then, Israeli officers who served during the Intifada told of their memories. Memories of violence, of suffering, of humiliation. The stories from both sides matched. Against the backdrop of local empty landscapes, an Israeli officer remembers... a Palestinian civilian remembers as well. A journey into the collective memory of Palestine and Israel takes place.","popularity":0.0718,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Edut","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51084,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shlomi Elkabetz","original_name":"Shlomi Elkabetz","popularity":0.103,"profile_path":"/ok6lRdA4jWfrOLJ9Odk9ygOuoXq.jpg","credit_id":"651710b1ea84c7014efb0422","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2051984","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
