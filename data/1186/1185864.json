Life becomes too stressful for 8-year-old Majella and taking refuge she hides in a suitcase in her parents’ bedroom. She overhears their conversation, and her TV-addled imagination runs away with her when she believes her father has been murdered by her mother and his body bundled away under cover of darkness.  The Case of Majella McGinty shows the fantastical imagination of young children. This film combines the comical with the political, criticising the impact of violence on children’s lives. Set in 1970’s Derry, violence is rife, bombs can be heard in the distance and the army patrols the streets where Majella and her friends play.","popularity":0.2755,"poster_path":"/kV9IQr6Kzkc1ufNvzOS67wNZ1Ea.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":209918,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rough Magic Film
