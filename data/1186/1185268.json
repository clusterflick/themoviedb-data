Randy George’s group Ajalon joined Neal for \"Wind at my Back\", \"Sing it High\", \"We All Need Some Light\", as well as a few others. A really nice version of \"Heaven in My Heart\". And some rather obscure songs that Neal doesn’t usually do. There’s a nice acoustic Spock’s Beard medley, as well as some songs from Testimony 1.
