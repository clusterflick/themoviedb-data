Instead of a spoken narrative, the film resorts to exaggerated emotional and physical displays, and utilises fragmented and often conflicting testimonies, doppelgängers, and a surrealist visual language to appeal to notions of truth and fiction, and different temporalities.  The cast of the film sees two protagonists, the artist’s parents, assume multiple identities – from presenters to reportage subjects, to eyewitnesses – resulting in a mobius loop where they are the objects, the spectators, and the medium, who narrate and consume their own stories in an endless cycle. It explores the phenomena of mutism resultant from trauma, and the cognitive distortions which come from living in a constant state of emergency; and what happens to urgency when it becomes timeless.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/zryx4IBcUmEmMvf2VhfAHTVMMYk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tomorrow, again","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4298973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nahia Benyamin","original_name":"Nahia Benyamin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6518423b07216600ff3599a0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4298974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mishel Benyamin","original_name":"Mishel Benyamin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65184249967cc73427f0a542","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4298976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boulos Benyamin","original_name":"Boulos Benyamin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65184259967cc73427f0a550","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4298978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Souhad Daw","original_name":"Souhad Daw","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"651842629b861600e24ff94e","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2677821,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chrystel Elias","original_name":"Chrystel Elias","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6518429b967cc73428cad689","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4298982,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Wardy Abu Khadra","original_name":"Wardy Abu Khadra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651842e09d592c0102bf8dbe","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4298979,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Omar Jabareen","original_name":"Omar Jabareen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6518427d967cc73425f00418","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4127191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Muhammad Toukhy","original_name":"Muhammad Toukhy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651842cb93bd690138fd81cf","department":"Visual Effects","job":"VFX Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4298980,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Binya Reches","original_name":"Binya Reches","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651842bb07216600e2d5b005","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3015304,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mona Benyamin","original_name":"Mona Benyamin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fda160197de4014914d4fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/czQ47KjF5eT3hgUNqJEm6Kfw7O3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j8pqfLvNOCec8CJ3nFNNwt6Gkco.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xSUONRR2P1hdurrQJdqwWCX8Ozz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zryx4IBcUmEmMvf2VhfAHTVMMYk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
