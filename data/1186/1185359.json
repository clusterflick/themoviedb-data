But after he moved with his parents to a distant big city, his life changed completely. During his school years, he slowly realised that his ethnic background caused him many problems. He set a goal to move there one day, but the distance didn't help loosen the shackles on his mind. Jacob thought it was fine as long as he went far enough away, but he did not expect it to be at the cost of loneliness and the imprisonment of the soul.","popularity":0.0437,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stories of Jacob","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3228497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Perghuzat Enver","original_name":"Perghuzat Enver","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65171c4e93bd6900e12d3b1b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4297678,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ko Yujeong","original_name":"Ko Yujeong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65171c64a199a6011b2244e2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3228497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Perghuzat Enver","original_name":"Perghuzat Enver","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65171c7eea84c7010c121863","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3228497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Perghuzat Enver","original_name":"Perghuzat Enver","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65171c8b9b8616013a2453a1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3228497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Perghuzat Enver","original_name":"Perghuzat Enver","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65171c999b8616011c488dcb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4297681,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Ronner","original_name":"David Ronner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65171caaea84c700ca06f4a0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4297683,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Stolz","original_name":"David Stolz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65171cb693bd6900fe485615","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
