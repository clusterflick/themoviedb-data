Until the fall of 1981, they lived and worked there together: renovating the rooms, painting the facade, publishing a newspaper for the neighborhood, setting up an autonomous cultural center, and establishing a \"parents' meeting\" there for parents of squatters. Despite an intensive press campaign and ongoing public relations work, the house at Winterfeldtstraße 20/22 was evicted by the police on September 22, 1981. After the eviction, some squatters move in with their friends, others move into a squatted house on Potsdamer Strasse.","popularity":0.1012,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7201,"logo_path":"/ljV8ZT3CIYCEIEDlTyBliXJVCZr.png","name":"NDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":23983,"logo_path":"/mwdVAta6xcY8eCpL5t8KKc96BWm.png","name":"SR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":160,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gefühl und Härte","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4299288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ingeborg Brockmeyer","original_name":"Ingeborg Brockmeyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6518834a967cc734295c3ddb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4299290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georg Böhler","original_name":"Georg Böhler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6518835007216600ff35aa22","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4299291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susanne Heidel","original_name":"Susanne Heidel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65188357ea84c700ca078304","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3843661,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Annelies Schulz","original_name":"Annelies Schulz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"651883699d592c00e5ef7670","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4299294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisabeth Schulz","original_name":"Elisabeth Schulz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"65188371ea84c700ca078312","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4299295,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klaus-Dieter Schulz","original_name":"Klaus-Dieter Schulz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"651883769b8616011c491f99","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4299297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antje Tiemeyer","original_name":"Antje Tiemeyer","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6518837cea84c700eb995797","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4299298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefan Tschöpe","original_name":"Stefan Tschöpe","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"65188383a199a600ab193222","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4299299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernst-Christian Zander","original_name":"Ernst-Christian Zander","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"65188388967cc734295c3dfa","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1703094,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bernd Liebner","original_name":"Bernd Liebner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651883b69d592c0102bfa15f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1703094,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bernd Liebner","original_name":"Bernd Liebner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6518839a9d592c012216c16a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1703094,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bernd Liebner","original_name":"Bernd Liebner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651883a5ea84c7014efb9c8c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323069,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jens-Peter Behrend","original_name":"Jens-Peter Behrend","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651883ae9b861600acaf72d1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12211828","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
