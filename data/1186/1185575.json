The museum featured more than 173000 objects, spanning seven thousand years, from Scythian gold to World War II weaponry. Two weeks before Kherson was liberated by the Ukrainians, Russian occupational forces enacted a strategic theft, stripping centuries of Ukrainian history from the museum/region. The sound of shellings and missile strikes was recorded during filming inside the museum on December 12, less than two kilometers away from russian-occupied territory.","popularity":0.0608,"poster_path":"/96GRGSwjdVQkMqtTiFQhV1dWawK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2023-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Explosions
