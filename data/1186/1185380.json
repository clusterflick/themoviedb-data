Mutt goes to the dance hall to show off his moves, leaving Jeff behind to tend to the fireplaces. Jeff cries because he wants to dance, too. A fairy godmother appears and transforms Jeff into a dapper gentleman. She gives him special shoes that allow him to out-dance anything. Before leaving, she warns Jeff that at midnight, all the magic will be undone. Jeff dances so well that Mutt becomes jealous, but it's Jeff's turn to feel embarrassed when he loses track of time and the clock strikes twelve.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1925-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Kick For Cinderella","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1824146","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Specific release date not listed","release_date":"1925-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
