Partly fictionalised story of a Dutch resistance fighter who is caught and executed by the Germans. A metal worker goes to ground because he doesn't want to collaborate with the Germans. He joins the resistance movement and, after being wounded during a raid, he ends up in hospital. He escapes but is arrested not long after and taken to a concentration camp. He is executed in September 1944, just weeks before the Allied forces reach the camp. The name LO-LKP refers to the Landelijke Organisatie voor Hulp aan Onderduikers (National Organisation for People in Hiding) and the resistance movement Landelijke Knokploegen (national commandos), set up by the organisation. The film was commissioned by the LO-LKP after the war.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/aNo6vXoXRtjQgs14RJsNn50Ex4K.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1949-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"LO/LKP","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1334570,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Max de Haas","original_name":"Max de Haas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65174814a199a600ab18aed1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1891855","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1411,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aNo6vXoXRtjQgs14RJsNn50Ex4K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"1949-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
