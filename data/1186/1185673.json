He then visited Nepal, a country near the Himalayas, five years ago. Nepal does not include education for the arts such as art and music in its formal curriculum. Here, he has been an honorary principal in nearby schools and teaches children pictures. His children and residents call him Kim Sir. Having entered Korea in early 2020 to renew his visa, he cannot return to Nepal due to COVID-19. Ten months later, he barely returns to Nepal to meet his children. While the teacher was away, the children soothed their longing with the drawings he taught them. Kim Sir heads to their home with pictures of children in nice frames. A bright picture drawn by children is hung on the wall of a poor earthen house. Hope hangs on the wall.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/4mpAH3DaJfjYF9IuyIEckm0l1eJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2021-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Nepali","iso_639_1":"ne","name":""},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Namaste Kim Sir.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4298996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Kyu-hyun","original_name":"Kim Kyu-hyun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"651844ff967cc73428cad729","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2233732,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Jong-eun","original_name":"이종은","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651844d0967cc7342466c75b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/4mpAH3DaJfjYF9IuyIEckm0l1eJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":2850,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/3qi8TuDfRj98nztzjRFM7VI49Mz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"All","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"All","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"EBS International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2021-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
