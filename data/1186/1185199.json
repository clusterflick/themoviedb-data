Their stubbornness and attachment to their golden era, together with Francesc’s cantankerous personality, make them incredible endearing. This very original documentary covers some of the best Catalan cuisine ever cooked, but it is more about integrity, adherence to principles, refusal to move with the fads and, ultimately, an incredibly zest and passion for life. It is also a wonderful love story.","popularity":0.051,"poster_path":"/883h6qqUg8sULDC6WNjesVvnFMf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2023-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BINU: A TWO STARS STORY","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Binu: Història de dues estrelles","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4297171,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesc Francina","original_name":"Francesc Francina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6516c950c50ad2012c1842fc","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4297169,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guillem Cabra","original_name":"Guillem Cabra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6516c939a199a6011b222734","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4297170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mar Clapés","original_name":"Mar Clapés","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6516c94693bd6900fe4834a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29596772","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.782,"height":864,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5khtTE7AZIuEyRyRJ4htHtiVhwb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1540}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":890,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/883h6qqUg8sULDC6WNjesVvnFMf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":594},{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":770,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/oCmXLWkpStcglxKiwA3lmUNeXOh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":539},{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":758,"iso_639_1":"ca","file_path":"/ldgjf2rlGfM2YtYkhieXP0uEN44.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540},{"aspect_ratio":0.682,"height":1099,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xCJvdt07IkhGsm1QQP2FFxL5cKW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750},{"aspect_ratio":0.682,"height":1099,"iso_639_1":"ca","file_path":"/ocI1uybyfzz0XM34R8CdY61a5ef.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ca","note":"Cambridge Film Festival)","release_date":"2023-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
