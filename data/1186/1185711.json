It does not exist in the scope of grand events, but rather in the mundane, in gestures and in that, which is recognisable. Thus emerges a portrait of the city through the eyes of a new generation – with a slightly glazed look, lightly clenched teeth, and an always surrendering heart. Valters is a boy from Riga, a twenty-year-old who is more attracted to life on the opposite side of the sea than to the aches of coming of age. Oscillating between his duties as a sailor, a loving relationship that is beginning to show cracks, and a routine life, he searches for meaning in the excesses of written surfeits.","popularity":0.0586,"poster_path":"/aCy92hWiPcoQ84E3pOfUCYZaxD1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2023-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dog's Gaze","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2907579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kārlis Arnolds Avots","original_name":"Kārlis Arnolds Avots","popularity":0.0879,"profile_path":"/wGPkgIvlBxFs83TaQ9SDifhWlY9.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65185094967cc73427f0a9e3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3712628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ieva Estere Barkāne","original_name":"Ieva Estere Barkāne","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"651850af96e30b00adb24854","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4299058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elīza Legzdiņa","original_name":"Elīza Legzdiņa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"651850dba199a600ab19236f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4299054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ieva Aleksa","original_name":"Ieva Aleksa","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65185028c50ad2012c18e5b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31173777","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":788,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aCy92hWiPcoQ84E3pOfUCYZaxD1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":525}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Riga IFF","release_date":"2023-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"A DOG'S GAZE Trailer | RIGA IFF 2023","key":"G6HekAsSgl0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-09-27T07:02:32.000Z","id":"6526bbdaea84c700aef0b48f"}]}}}
