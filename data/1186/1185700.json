Its ephemeral shadow-light filters into the room of the other two, who search for her in their own reflections. It is a tale of sisterhood and the loss of sisterhood, quest and the failure of that quest. Its images are made through a series of long-exposure time-lapses inside a large camera obscura structure, and its text is based on a series of fictionalized real events and Lewis Carrollâ€™s Through the Looking Glass.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/4xQuh20p2HH0gD3wp4CBwz5tEgN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Must Be the Wood","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3535560,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Hogg","original_name":"Anna Hogg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/n42DgfLpHiJnhnXkc5It9Epm0YY.jpg","credit_id":"65184cc3a199a600c49dd647","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4xQuh20p2HH0gD3wp4CBwz5tEgN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5s7t4eb0AaV10mkh3fxnbEPfkBf.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
