A filmed image of the sea is projected onto a wall. Overlayed onto the film is a Morse code strip punctured with the text of a report on the state of the ocean. The soundtrack of the text being transmitted makes standing in the space slightly unsettlingâ€”the high-pitched tone of the code signal and the strobe-like effect of the projected image combine to create a queasiness that might, perhaps, mirror what one would feel if they were to decode the text of the environmental report.","popularity":0.0456,"poster_path":"/Am39LhUfutiCNXR5UFHiZYmgrzC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3928552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erin Johnson","original_name":"Erin Johnson","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/d2SAjR4xAwXJAJlfGAW57IzE7bs.jpg","credit_id":"6518373e967cc734295c2668","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Am39LhUfutiCNXR5UFHiZYmgrzC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
