Those familiar with cartoonist Bruce Pettyâ€™s award winning film Leisure will enjoy the same sharp wit brought to bear on another institution, the media. This three-part film is a satirical enquiry into the origins of media, their distribution and their effects on the way we behave. The first part provides a brief history of print, radio, television and film. The second part proposes that a market-placed media produces the problem of monopolisation leading to mediocrity. Finally, Petty produces a caricature of the way ideas form in the mind from reading print, as distinct from passive looking and listening.","popularity":0.1296,"poster_path":"/taFcHjnXjpnp2dkGoF7qUOMlaOg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Megalomedia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":235969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Gillies","original_name":"Max Gillies","popularity":0.0866,"profile_path":"/5IXFEbGUyQI9SLrh3QVfXVEiLTz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Town Crier","credit_id":"65931475ce4ddc6d387e9e3b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1190311,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Petty","original_name":"Bruce Petty","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65162f5ec50ad200c91a03db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29337633","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/taFcHjnXjpnp2dkGoF7qUOMlaOg.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uGjMULluQZlJ4ON9cv7ge9t8YQw.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
