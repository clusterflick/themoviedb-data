It is perhaps the most popular poster on student dorm walls from Beijing to Boston.  Painted in Vienna around 1908, the evocative image of an unknown embracing couple has captivated viewers with its mystery, sensuality and dazzling materials ever since it was created. But just what lies behind the appeal of the painting â€“ and just who was the artist that created it?  Delving into the details of real gold, decorative designs, symbolism and simmering erotica, a close study of the painting takes us to the remarkable turn of the century Vienna when a new world was battling with the old.","popularity":1.1117,"poster_path":"/orVeKxKtPegIyiQwEnTfrax90q9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45654,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seventh Art Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":209856,"logo_path":null,"name":"Exhibition on Screen (GB)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Klimt & The Kiss","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Klimt and the Kiss","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Klimt und Der Kuss","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Klimt & Der Kuss","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2479475,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ali Ray","original_name":"Ali Ray","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651690d2ea84c7014efad0a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Grabsky","original_name":"Phil Grabsky","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6517a993d4653709dc7c12e1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1833712,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Amanda Wilkie","original_name":"Amanda Wilkie","popularity":0.0774,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6517a98793bd6900fe489c07","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406727,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Asa Bennett","original_name":"Asa Bennett","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6517a9729b861600ff69117e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2282507,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Clive Mattock","original_name":"Clive Mattock","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6517a97eea84c7012d66f344","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29661422","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"exhibitiononscreen","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eyb9txvnuiyAYdtrpARmXxh3vSB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ztDT0gluQNDmnu6PTyeEExWiKBv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/8TrJVFVnkVUFvgo1n9IniLwihao.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l9EhiCi9KcNxqAsEzcUIc5YP0EA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/orVeKxKtPegIyiQwEnTfrax90q9.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bxckrwWqhojN4Fnbq3KhQSjzT55.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1350},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2384,"iso_639_1":"cs","file_path":"/5SnH23BMbWOdugVmX8Dhn4xYEkq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1589},{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":794,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/6AYZzH9RdBEZIDNTV0FkUpSHFNE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5918,"name":"painting"},{"id":4434,"name":"interview"},{"id":437,"name":"painter"},{"id":18267,"name":"vienna, austria"},{"id":171453,"name":"art history"},{"id":177044,"name":"austrian"},{"id":229777,"name":"expert opinion"},{"id":282597,"name":"art historian"},{"id":303954,"name":"art documentary"},{"id":323325,"name":"klimt"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"12+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"12A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Official Trailer","key":"MrzIYb9VGlY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2023-08-25T10:16:27.000Z","id":"6516904493bd6900fe48179c"}]}}}
