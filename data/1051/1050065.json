Together with childhood friends Richard Lyons and Mark Hosler they formed Negativland, which quickly became an absurd and noisy multimedia world without boundaries, ownership or privacy. Negativland's complex chaos of plunderphonics poses both serious and silly questions about the nature of culture, media, technology, control, propaganda, power and perception in the United States of America. Is what you're hearing and seeing real or simply familiar? The medium reveals that any message is all in our heads.","popularity":0.1532,"poster_path":"/pSMjGm7SaYxljWP2GqEN9wTZZLS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Everything you want is true, even if it isn't","title":"Stand By for Failure: A Documentary About Negativland","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1292742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David 'Weatherman' Wills","original_name":"David 'Weatherman' Wills","popularity":0.0243,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"637706352faf4d0076dd921b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292741,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Lyons","original_name":"Richard Lyons","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6377065c255dba00cd3ea735","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Hosler","original_name":"Mark Hosler","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63770672fab3fa00b4d068a4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Joyce","original_name":"Don Joyce","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6377068a11c06600abe2c391","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3791504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Allen","original_name":"Ian Allen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"637706ae66a7c300d55aeb60","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Grigg","original_name":"Chris Grigg","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"637706bddfe31d007f5306d2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2331257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Conheim","original_name":"Peter Conheim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"637706d2e8999b00a46037bb","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2331259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Leidecker","original_name":"Jon Leidecker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"637706dc11c06600c8006d1a","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1315856,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Worsley","original_name":"Ryan Worsley","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63770749fab3fa007fbe57bb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1315856,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Worsley","original_name":"Ryan Worsley","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63770740c2f44b00917a1a22","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33381623","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"Negativlanddoc","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pSMjGm7SaYxljWP2GqEN9wTZZLS.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uK7wm7yAsxeIwVGmH0OBm0TMdvc.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":533},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lJj3hUXwgbMsOBcXV32ibVHBQ6s.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Other Cinema - San Francisco","release_date":"2022-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"PhilaMOCA - Philadelphia","release_date":"2022-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"STAND BY FOR FAILURE / A Documentary About Negativland / FULL MOVIE","key":"JWYVxDmdrfg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2024-06-23T03:36:46.000Z","id":"674ce50305af10015fb821de"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"FIRST FULL FIVE MINUTES - STAND BY FOR FAILURE - A Negativland Documentary","key":"cGHWKvlbUEA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2022-10-11T16:58:36.000Z","id":"637708372faf4d00b417cd97"}]}}}
