It’s a dilemma facing gender non-binary and trans singers working in a field whose roles are rigidly defined along gender lines: sopranos and mezzos are cast as women (so-called “trouser roles” aside); tenors and basses as men.  Teiya Kasahara (they/them) leads a new generation of trans* opera performers, activists and self-proclaimed “shit-disturbers” making their voices heard–whether the classical music world likes it or not.","popularity":0.0445,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Opera Trans*formed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3791429,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teiya Kasahara","original_name":"Teiya Kasahara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6376ec1f11c06600abe2bb94","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3791428,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Sarrouh","original_name":"Maria Sarrouh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6376ebde11c066008e9a4da5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3791427,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leah Borts-Kuperman","original_name":"Leah Borts-Kuperman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6376ebb05b2f47009143a7ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Toronto Short Film Festival","release_date":"2022-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
