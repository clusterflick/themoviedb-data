Inspired by their childhood idol Terry Fox, the cousins leave Sept-Îles to reach the place where the famous one-legged runner prematurely ended his Marathon of Hope : Thunder Bay, Ontario. In a sincere attempt to pay tribute to Terry, Richard travels on his bike without ever touching his handlebars, while Clément follows him in his beat-up pick-up truck. The road is long, and sometimes, the best way forward might be backwards.","popularity":0.1097,"poster_path":"/67clBklXBl8dHmh3D39e51LsiUS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91301,"logo_path":null,"name":"Art & Essai","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FOLLOW THE FOX","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathieu Gosselin","original_name":"Mathieu Gosselin","popularity":0.0715,"profile_path":"/3gpppct3xfpGFyN3AJk738UR75k.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Clément","credit_id":"63780c8dc2f44b007dae4f66","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":520398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis La Haye","original_name":"Francis La Haye","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":"/f8QhyOwQtg2RsyADWhvEty7O7Yq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Richard","credit_id":"63780c9b02842000cc1d7a03","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2749862,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Laganiere","original_name":"Simon Laganiere","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63780cad336e01009be4f218","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2749862,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Laganiere","original_name":"Simon Laganiere","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63780cbe336e0100b4f99e60","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":986587,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mathieu Denis","original_name":"Mathieu Denis","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":"/7hVwadQx4cgxjn8NOAvm1uzTFCK.jpg","credit_id":"63780cd002842000c2cb1bdd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1529075,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Geneviève Perron","original_name":"Geneviève Perron","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63780cf0156cc7008217fc74","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1114394,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Marjorie Rhéaume","original_name":"Marjorie Rhéaume","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63780cfefab3fa0082039425","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1928861,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Annie Jean","original_name":"Annie Jean","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63780e0d5b2f47007531d0c3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/67clBklXBl8dHmh3D39e51LsiUS.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/R9Qx2k5aeKjv8v48rj9H8SLP02.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Suivre la piste du renard - Follow the fox (2013)","key":"67239722","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2013-05-29T19:29:21.000Z","id":"63780d1834e152007f377f5f"}]}}}
