Born in a computer, the building jumps again into video where it can mutate freely. Here, particles becomes pixels and matter becomes light, as the structure is melted, frozen, shattered, and melted again into a new, transmissible signal. Shot at the H2O expo, Zierikzee, The Netherlands. Architect: Lars Spueybroek/NOX.  \"Van McElwee transports his viewers hypnotically, viscerally, imaginatively through ingenious fascinating images and sounds. Traveling through his video art, you know youâ€™re in the hands of a dreamer and an artist.\" - Diane Carson, St. Louis Riverfront Times","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/9ry3aqaIle9ywVJIPsTdU0z5zx1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Waveform Modulation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1288849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Van McElwee","original_name":"Van McElwee","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/5kucYiJ9HWOT0tAtdSBbG3MJIfh.jpg","credit_id":"63795932976e4800b4557ef4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5306699,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lynnie McElwee","original_name":"Lynnie McElwee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d5f9cb31678cc3f8014871","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5306821,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peter Roe","original_name":"Peter Roe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d5fa2c5963ebffde7bd38c","department":"Production","job":"Production Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5306822,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ryan Smyth","original_name":"Ryan Smyth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d5fa4931678cc3f80148a0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457612,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Aaron Crozier","original_name":"Aaron Crozier","popularity":0.0667,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d5fa6031538de608f18b9d","department":"Editing","job":"Additional Editing"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":971,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vN0Bi2HW9nPeegg1fSOOoI57I8H.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":729},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1371,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9ry3aqaIle9ywVJIPsTdU0z5zx1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":914}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
