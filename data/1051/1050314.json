Gladys, from her everlasting confinement in the house where she works as a live-in servant. Ima, in her everlasting waiting on the seashore for the next ship breaking its nets. Both have unrecognised jobs in which duties invade them until there’s no room for their own lives. It doesn’t matter what time their phones ring. Gladys can never answer, Ima is obliged to answer at all times. They both have to leave their families behind. Spaces that are work, work that is about houses and houses that are not always homes. The memories of their experiences are intertwined in a sensory story that leads us to a question: whose hands are the ones to change the situation?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Ruins","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1707174,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Anna Fernandez de Paco","original_name":"Anna Fernandez de Paco","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6377f98b11c066008e9a9aea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Camerimage Film Festival","release_date":"2022-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
