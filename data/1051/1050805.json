In Radio Island, this metaphor is expanded to include the entire built environment and the whole of ordinary consciousness. Mutating images of ancient and modern Japanese structures develop within a complex electronic score of radio signals and data transmission. Unusual editing techniques weave these images and sounds into a dense field of improvisation. The resulting texture becomes the raw material for totally new forms. Through a sea of noise, Radio Island charts a course from architecture to music; from the referential to the absolute.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/8aUuvOMtDI4zeVcoJCBe1tLdnwr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Radio Island","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1288849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Van McElwee","original_name":"Van McElwee","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/5kucYiJ9HWOT0tAtdSBbG3MJIfh.jpg","credit_id":"637973103d3557007c94d54e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5306699,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lynnie McElwee","original_name":"Lynnie McElwee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d5ef93191868c54ff168bc","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5306750,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jeff Reynolds","original_name":"Jeff Reynolds","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d5efa80525f3d74f0148ee","department":"Editing","job":"Additional Editing"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5306701,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Josh Riggs","original_name":"Josh Riggs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d5efc00525f3d74f0148f9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1371,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8aUuvOMtDI4zeVcoJCBe1tLdnwr.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":914},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1058,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1nA8XQuIP6R8OXTByXnwdzcmb7c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":706}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
