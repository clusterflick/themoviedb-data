He discovers why the new towns are there and how they enticed people out of the bigger cities, and uncovers the surprising ways in which public art changed the new towns and the new towns changed public art.  Mark's father, Stan, made sculptures that stand to this day on the streets of Glenrothes, East Kilbride and the Scottish new town that never was, Stonehouse. These new towns employed town artists to make artworks in the very housing precincts the new residents were moving into.","popularity":0.3067,"poster_path":"/ci95IVGceAUW6ygIF7iBlRi8L6t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":3712,"logo_path":"/7PdJYn2l0iBViud7oqxRHO9UEIR.png","name":"BBC Scotland","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":110125,"logo_path":"/qcmPNQ9CDGi5rtkpz7tGOfmLFtR.png","name":"Objective Media Group","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meet You at the Hippos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1231402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Bonnar","original_name":"Mark Bonnar","popularity":1.039,"profile_path":"/qEOp1lj0HGAVy1wpqIxMNkxIzn7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"63798638976e4800b4558e67","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1565414,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Cocker","original_name":"Jack Cocker","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637986b19ecf1800c4e237f0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1331960,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Toby Stevens","original_name":"Toby Stevens","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637986d1fab3fa00b4d149ae","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ci95IVGceAUW6ygIF7iBlRi8L6t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":388,"name":"scotland"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":256218,"name":"public art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
