These rarely seen live performances by Thin Lizzy perfectly capture the band at their peak - on stage, hard and loud.  Lizzy set the benchmark for live rock music which has never been equalled or surpassed. This unique film includes previously unreleased footage of Thin Lizzy in vintage performances from the key stages of their career. From the original line-up with Eric Bell through the classic Live and Dangerous era with Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson, and onto the very last incarnation of the band, this is why Lizzy has never been equalled as a live band.  From such classics as 'The Boys Are Back In Town' and 'Whiskey In The Jar' to thundering versions of 'Massacre' and 'Sha-la-la', here is the proof which shows why Lizzy is so influential today and how they played their way to legendary status.","popularity":0.1116,"poster_path":"/6MwRM08GHYKDHCYxSAQz89CW799.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":186571,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Legends","origin_country":""},{"id":186572,"logo_path":null,"name":"Classic Rock Direct","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2005-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thin Lizzy: Masters from the Vault","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238955,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Lynott","original_name":"Phil Lynott","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":"/7ciNbQkH4nZaJzLf6qiuUJT8JpP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Vocals / Bass / Guitar","credit_id":"6378be55c2f44b00917aa2ad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1022697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Downey","original_name":"Brian Downey","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/hRWacE6J0lhQ5PhV4q6tM4Iu9MK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Drums / Percussion","credit_id":"6378be6cc2f44b007ab20624","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117455,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Gorham","original_name":"Scott Gorham","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/gJc4GkTQZ7q5abDL1117Cs6Mw2K.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Guitar","credit_id":"6378be7f336e0100d9782fe6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Robertson","original_name":"Brian Robertson","popularity":0.1202,"profile_path":"/mDEmCxCsBSAqV3IWPRPqbO3CMXB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Guitar / Backing Vocals","credit_id":"6378be9b976e4800dcd92244","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6MwRM08GHYKDHCYxSAQz89CW799.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
