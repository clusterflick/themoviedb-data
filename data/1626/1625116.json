Daniel Léger experienced his first manic episode in his early thirties. With courage and vulnerability, he recounts how his diagnosis shook his identity to the core. Through striking images created with fire and soot by visual artist Steven Spazuk, the film depicts Léger’s personality in rich nuances of shadow and light. The transformations paint a sensitive portrait of a man who, despite his mental health struggles, has been able to rise from the ashes.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/ubimH7L4aTFenUWtn1tyjqtErFK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Flames of Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1979511,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Léger","original_name":"Daniel Léger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/qjoBrhBhHV2l19ZYXTl3VZCvMRs.jpg","credit_id":"697b89b619f2ae51bdb81e6a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1979511,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Léger","original_name":"Daniel Léger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/qjoBrhBhHV2l19ZYXTl3VZCvMRs.jpg","credit_id":"697b89c3b086325a6bef4aa2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5971083,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Steven Spazuk","original_name":"Steven Spazuk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697b89ed83859e370022ba51","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Lanois","original_name":"Daniel Lanois","popularity":0.3379,"profile_path":"/sjfoRCI0q8ZS5frVlvby2QatfYy.jpg","credit_id":"697b8a1da4b77f3178c21a8d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ubimH7L4aTFenUWtn1tyjqtErFK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"CA","iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/58SsdJOYqn7sfT3iYeEmjnpvc3S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
