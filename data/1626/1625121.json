Following a filmmaker who goes back to Syria after twelve years in exile, in the wake of the Assad regime’s fall, the film weaves together the stories of survivors of torture, imprisonment, and displacement as they fight to hold regime officials accountable—even those hiding in Europe. Between courtrooms abroad and ruins at home, Ashes becomes a living archive: voices refusing disappearance, memories demanding recognition, and testimony transformed into resistance. More than a story of war, it asks an urgent question for Syrians and for the world: can justice and dignity be rebuilt from the ruins, or will silence prevail once more?","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":286271,"logo_path":null,"name":"BEL Studios","origin_country":""},{"id":93323,"logo_path":"/fi63y4d3mn3myCHMG8t1II2yeHb.png","name":"Antipode Films","origin_country":"NO"},{"id":18740,"logo_path":"/11dLmhNuO6Pgd8tSDvktsOkP94R.png","name":"Zadig Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SY","name":"Syrian Arab Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Ashes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3724472,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daham Alasaad","original_name":"Daham Alasaad","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/jB2yeSuj9bGJzRm2CWfI5FPGB0L.jpg","credit_id":"697b8aa07cfd9c5d208f8dca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5971091,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alhomam Alasaad","original_name":"Alhomam Alasaad","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697b8b089ad9395d9522baed","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2571863,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bård Kjøge Rønning","original_name":"Bård Kjøge Rønning","popularity":0.1014,"profile_path":"/z2mOVjcpPfAroZ7bqmVutHjeXnL.jpg","credit_id":"697b8b109ab6bff5b8c21922","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1958666,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Céline Nusse","original_name":"Céline Nusse","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697b8b269ad9395d9522baf6","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
