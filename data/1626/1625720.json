Unlike his friends Fritz Lang and Marlene Dietrich, Gerron refused to leave Germany and was ultimately sent to the Theresienstadt Ghetto, along with many other cultural icons of his time. When Gerron arrives, camp commander (and fan) Karl Rahm orders Gerron to direct a propaganda film about the camp, to show the 'luxurious' conditions to the world. With no choice in the matter, Gerron embarks on what will be his last film, trying to give his fellow prisoners fleeting moments of humanity in the process.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":24662,"logo_path":"/pME6OvhHDJPU96MthlqBolVoimO.png","name":"Pie Films","origin_country":"IL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Gerron’s Last Film","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Gad","original_name":"Josh Gad","popularity":4.0256,"profile_path":"/bgRWcrD9hfaa2f7RUWJzxmJaWuD.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Kurt Gerron","credit_id":"697cbb18674406e4ddc5bb95","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133502,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Curtis","original_name":"Simon Curtis","popularity":0.4934,"profile_path":"/7gQqZO7uoHNrHX6IZfCLCtXBDkU.jpg","credit_id":"697cbb293e06955bf2f95f7a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1703594,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Osnat Handelsman-Keren","original_name":"Osnat Handelsman-Keren","popularity":0.1014,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697cbb38eaec4b0daff95f37","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1393092,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Talia Kleinhendler","original_name":"Talia Kleinhendler","popularity":0.5741,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697cbb408f6f2007b3fee575","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56786,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ross Emery","original_name":"Ross Emery","popularity":0.2792,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697cbb5194f44448e859a395","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937415,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Adam Recht","original_name":"Adam Recht","popularity":0.1664,"profile_path":"/pHmyTG9t5l9OvM8Kdnm3kXHxmau.jpg","credit_id":"697cbb58f4530ab9a3909c5d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":569332,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alon Gur Arye","original_name":"Alon Gur Arye","popularity":0.2449,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697cbb67823c0b2e31e39d7f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1879635,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ehud Lavski","original_name":"Ehud Lavski","popularity":0.0421,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697cbb6e2dd4bb3943909c68","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt39481003","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1631,"name":"concentration camp"},{"id":9672,"name":"based on true story"},{"id":15060,"name":"period drama"},{"id":192772,"name":"historical drama"},{"id":207883,"name":"1940s"},{"id":328926,"name":"based on real person"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
