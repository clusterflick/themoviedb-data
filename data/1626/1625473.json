Following a brutal rape and bashing in Floods Lane Surry Hills in January 1996, the gay & Iesbian community held a ally in nearby Taylor Square as a public protest against homophobic violence. Mary, a mother of two and the survivor of the attack, spoke publicly about the incident. Sensing the anger and pan of her community, Mary talked about convening this outrage into positive action. In going public. Mary was making a statement that shame and guilt silences so many survivors of abuse, thus allowing perpetrators to continue repeating offences. Mary's Place is about the power of each individual to have an impact on reducing violence in our community and on our streets.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mary's Place","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0209135","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Mardi Gras Film Festival","release_date":"1998-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
