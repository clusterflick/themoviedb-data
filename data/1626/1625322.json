Drawn deeper into the streets of Paris, he follows the figure through an urban underworld where identity blurs, time fractures, and meaning slips out of reach.  Inspired by Edgar Allan Poe’s \"The Man of the Crowd,\" REFLECTION OF A DEADMAN is a hypnotic  descent into dissociation, anonymity and the quiet terror of losing yourself while trying to find yourself.  Shot on location in the alleys, cemeteries and catacombs of Paris.
