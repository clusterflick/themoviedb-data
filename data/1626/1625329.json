He lives and works on farms across Canada, discovering how farmers survive and healing his broken heart.  He rediscovers a rural way of life that is defies his expectations of a nine-to-five in the city. He is forced to rethink the idea that being wealthy means earning a lot of money. Farmers love their way of life. But does that make it okay that most farmers work off-farm jobs to afford to stay on the land? Can our farmers afford to feed us?  That way of life is threatened by the enormous cost of farmland — far more than farmers can earn. But the successful farmers make farming their life’s work and focus less on the finances.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hands That Feed Us","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21959562","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
