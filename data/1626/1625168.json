Despite its significance, Stutthof remains one of the least documented sites of Nazi persecution, leaving families of its victims with lingering questions.  Through witness testimonies and archival traces, the film follows Isabella’s search for Uncle Edmund and the lives of those who endured Stutthof, offering a quiet reflection on memory, loss, and the lasting echoes of trauma that continue to shape the generations that followed.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/aEEIGoGcI2qDao5rgr3Ct2AxvHX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Discovering Edmund","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5971322,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bella Kolb","original_name":"Bella Kolb","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697b9d01ae8d391d3e7f09d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5971322,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bella Kolb","original_name":"Bella Kolb","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697b9d14636d0edf057f0a6f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5971322,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bella Kolb","original_name":"Bella Kolb","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697b9d224959f7b99c8f8ea7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2048,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aEEIGoGcI2qDao5rgr3Ct2AxvHX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1536}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3409,"name":"gdansk, poland"},{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":2754,"name":"trauma"},{"id":3371,"name":"family history"},{"id":10939,"name":"holocaust (shoah) survivor"},{"id":21747,"name":"poland"},{"id":356906,"name":"holocaust"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
