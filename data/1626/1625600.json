It is a reflective piece exploring the feeling of inequality about knowing details about an artist or celebrities personal life after viewing their work, yet knowing they don’t and might never know you. In retracing Millers own footsteps and questioning this power balance and relationship, the film poses an examination into identity and asks how well we can really know a stranger as well as how well do we know ourselves.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"AS SHOWN AT THE TATE BRITAIN","title":"There Is A Woman In The Attic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3504199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emma Broderick","original_name":"Emma Broderick","popularity":0.0314,"profile_path":"/hkvrO5ATgmxG9PiKRRu5u1Esc7m.jpg","credit_id":"697c907765c5367531a09994","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3504199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emma Broderick","original_name":"Emma Broderick","popularity":0.0314,"profile_path":"/hkvrO5ATgmxG9PiKRRu5u1Esc7m.jpg","credit_id":"697c9116d1f10fa600e39db0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2026-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
