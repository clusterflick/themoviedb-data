Nina files nails in an authoritarian state, while Anna is stuck in a rut in her own home. United by their insomnia and frustration with the world, one evening a hole opens up in the ground, swallowing the women along with their bed and catapulting them headfirst out the other side of the world. One wakes up in the waiting room of a government office, the other in a cell in a women's prison.
