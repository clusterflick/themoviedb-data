For him, his daughters are still little children. When Sakit finds out that his eldest daughter Lala and his middle daughter Jala have someone they love, he cannot find peace. Instead of accepting the prospective sons-in-law, Sakit begins to put them through increasingly difficult and funny trials, one after another. Caught between being a father and being a father-in-law, Sakit tries both to protect his daughters and not to stand in the way of love. At the same time, he himself is still being tested by his father-in-law, Vidadi.","popularity":0.0643,"poster_path":"/wXQtdMIujDYBEjbQq4IsREtRMWQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Azerbaijani","iso_639_1":"az","name":"Azərbaycan"}],"status":"Post
