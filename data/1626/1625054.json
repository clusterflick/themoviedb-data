Small hands claw their way out, and something new is born.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/p5p6F9T5GxWHuSwcz97LQtimG03.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Decay takes root.","title":"La Molaire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2900936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Ahern","original_name":"Peter Ahern","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":"/izKmB0bHqxJ0UPr6x2rbgjpFx2U.jpg","credit_id":"697b6eec12139bba9fa08e06","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2900936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Ahern","original_name":"Peter Ahern","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":"/izKmB0bHqxJ0UPr6x2rbgjpFx2U.jpg","credit_id":"697b6f01e41774543622b918","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2900936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Ahern","original_name":"Peter Ahern","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":"/izKmB0bHqxJ0UPr6x2rbgjpFx2U.jpg","credit_id":"697b74c1bd67c2603122b95f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2900936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Ahern","original_name":"Peter Ahern","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":"/izKmB0bHqxJ0UPr6x2rbgjpFx2U.jpg","credit_id":"697b75573ffdec006cef4a95","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2900936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Ahern","original_name":"Peter Ahern","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":"/izKmB0bHqxJ0UPr6x2rbgjpFx2U.jpg","credit_id":"697b75626000e5c08aa7ee10","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt39462391","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/p5p6F9T5GxWHuSwcz97LQtimG03.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
