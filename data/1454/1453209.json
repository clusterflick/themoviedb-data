Her long-distance girlfriend, Avery, struggles to hold on to her as Beck pushes her further and further away, consequently falling into an endless cycle of bad habits. Beck's selfish actions bring the two to their breaking point. Beck is forced to decide whether to let go of the father who has seemingly never forgiven her homosexuality or her girlfriend that symbolises her true acceptance of her queer identity. Sunset's Embrace is a visceral exploration of the contrasts in loneliness and isolation compared to loving emotional intimacy, as well as the celebration of found families within the LGBTQ+ community.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/demwf3nsVxWN7xLxjh136WbqdV1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sunset's Embrace","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5324284,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vianna Celeste","original_name":"Vianna Celeste","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67e0a9dff6a0fcbd004dc6ae","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5324285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita Nuamah","original_name":"Anita Nuamah","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67e0a9e81f256aef1cc6f4bd","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5324282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charlie Severs","original_name":"Charlie Severs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e0a9a5c0b4387a6ec738e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5324282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charlie Severs","original_name":"Charlie Severs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e0a9b3b8e0fea934080a55","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34377101","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":918,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/demwf3nsVxWN7xLxjh136WbqdV1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":621}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-08-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
