Two hapless state employed worker's job is collecting the unfortunate wildlife's remains that have collided with man's motor machines.  Longtime employee, Ed, knows how to monetize the dead animals collected off the road as well as exploit his fellow employees acting as a lone shark.  Lars, the new guy, is full of compassion for the animals as well as for his fellow humans.  The two share daily the confines of the cab of a state owned  work truck; the close proximity results in conflicts escalating into the confrontational climax of the two diametrically opposed personalities. In the bizarre conclusion we see a  rather nihilistic result that if we do not mend our way the result is not going to be pretty.","popularity":0.0492,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
