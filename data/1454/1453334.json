While he is cold and stand-offish, speaking few words of the strange European language they share, she is childlike despite being fully grown, prone to disappearing into the woods and self-harming with a detached curiosity.  The illusion, rough as it may be, is shattered one day by the arrival of something that Daughter has never seen before: another human being. As her father grows increasingly paranoid and militant in his attempts to keep the outside world away from them, the young woman begins to explore the possibility that the simple life she knows is more complex – and more enticing – than she’s been allowed to believe.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anemoia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3206376,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Berger-Alexander","original_name":"Daniel Berger-Alexander","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e124f1c2d819df69c76143","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
