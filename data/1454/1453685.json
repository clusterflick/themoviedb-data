The character of a place and the changes it has undergone over decades are revealed through a moving series of encounters with its residents.  Zeltzer documents the diversity of the city's population over the course of one summer. She talks to its residents, and sketches a diverse human fabric, an Israeli diversity that makes up the city's demographics today.  A microcosm of Israel 2015. Documenting the moments of encounter with the city's people reveals each time another layer of tensions and strangeness, friendships and enemies, racism and the struggle against it, education and culture and politics and past traumas.","popularity":0.231,"poster_path":"/ixcvmN3W6GoxfRdmaQOthjY1kbb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2025-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Summer in Arad","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1257791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anat Zeltzer","original_name":"Anat Zeltzer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self - Narrator","credit_id":"67e1e004e28af41cfc75c360","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1257791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anat Zeltzer","original_name":"Anat Zeltzer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e1de984c52746665dc642a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1257791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anat Zeltzer","original_name":"Anat Zeltzer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e1deae4c52746665dc6444","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2343996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Modi Bar-On","original_name":"Modi Bar-On","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e1deb8e28af41cfc75c34e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3234810,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Adi Moses","original_name":"Adi Moses","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e1dec9d70c61590375c6e6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1709440,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ido Mochrik","original_name":"Ido Mochrik","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e1def0440f311ace75c3fc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2860046,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eran Weitz","original_name":"Eran Weitz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e1df357db9e70c47dc57c6","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1257791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anat Zeltzer","original_name":"Anat Zeltzer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e26a27d4052f4793dc6793","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2343996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Modi Bar-On","original_name":"Modi Bar-On","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e26a577b7313b5aef052d2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ixcvmN3W6GoxfRdmaQOthjY1kbb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1143}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
