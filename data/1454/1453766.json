He graduated from the Moscow Conservatoire in 1977. In the 1980’s, he emigrated to the USA, taught at Indiana University, and later launched his own piano studio. Toradze was a brilliant interpreter of the works of Shostakovich, Mussorgsky, Scryabin, and Stravinsky. The recordings of Prokofiev’s concertos performed by Alexander Toradze with the Mariinsky Theater Orchestra conducted by Valery Gergiev are considered a gold standard. The pianist also appeared frequently with leading orchestras of Europe and the USA.","popularity":0.0552,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":257418,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lavr Studio","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2024-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lexo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Lekso","type":"Transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2180633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olesya Fokina","original_name":"Olesya Fokina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/34OTuhUK4lWEHwEOYrsQw8NQfd6.jpg","credit_id":"67e21b544c52746665dc77d6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2180633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olesya Fokina","original_name":"Olesya Fokina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/34OTuhUK4lWEHwEOYrsQw8NQfd6.jpg","credit_id":"67e21b5d16a3c5c224f04d53","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2372438,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergey Dogorov","original_name":"Sergey Dogorov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e21b70eba79f6ff7f0838d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5326517,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ирина Васильева","original_name":"Ирина Васильева","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e21c61440f311ace75d065","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5326521,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Серго Григорян","original_name":"Серго Григорян","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e21ddc7db9e70c47dc5edc","department":"Writing","job":"Creative Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5326519,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Владимир Никитин","original_name":"Владимир Никитин","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e21ded4c52746665dc7842","department":"Writing","job":"Creative Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5326530,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Сергей Борисов","original_name":"Сергей Борисов","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e21e13440f311ace75d104","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1588625,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrey Chernavin","original_name":"Andrey Chernavin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e21e51440f311ace75d117","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116351,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikhail Aldashin","original_name":"Михаил Алдашин","popularity":0.1375,"profile_path":"/kBmu6oeQ7OT9Hkt1jaQHEUxIlHf.jpg","credit_id":"67e21e73eba79f6ff7f08420","department":"Art","job":"Title Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow International Film Festival","release_date":"2025-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
