She had hoped that getting into a regular habit, having coffee and tea with her aunt, would bring her some peace – but pretty soon she’s had enough of the stultifying atmosphere. The village of Zonnemaire is no longer how she remembers it.  Sinke shot this film in the village where she herself grew up. The unaffected acting and attention to detail with which the day-to-day activities of Rina's uncle and aunt are depicted give the film an almost documentary feel.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/3eBI56gfzKaxYmbB8sKf35vpToc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Groeten uit Zonnemaire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":232631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Digna Sinke","original_name":"Digna Sinke","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e26c7c7b7313b5aef05372","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":864,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3eBI56gfzKaxYmbB8sKf35vpToc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":576}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
