The story explores the psychological toll of transitioning, from the internal battle of self-identity to the external rejection and mistreatment. It also sheds light on the exploitation and dehumanization of transgender individuals, focusing on how some people view them as sex objects, which exacerbates the protagonist's trauma. The film reflects on the challenges of being marginalized and misunderstood in a world that often fails to accept difference.","popularity":0.0322,"poster_path":"/gU3auJDj5buNRXCoIfx1ZmFhdFf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"I fall, I cry.
