He lives in the eastern cantons of Belgium, which were forcibly united with the German Reich after the invasion of German troops in May 1940. Those who did not volunteer for the Wehrmacht were – like Mathi Schenk – sent to war as forced soldiers for Germany. When the Warsaw Uprising broke out in August 1944, the 18-year-old arrived in the Polish capital and was assigned to the notorious SS Dirlewanger Brigade. During the 63 days of bitter fighting, which cost the lives of more than 200,000 Poles, he witnessed unimaginable atrocities against the people of Warsaw.  While fleeing the Red Army, Polish farmers found the young soldier wounded in a ditch. Despite his German uniform, they hid him from the Russians in their village.","popularity":0.3053,"poster_path":"/t1CsPsSdVpURy4K0kfEPcx5WEzV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mathi Schenk's Last Journey to Poland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1897946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthias Schenk","original_name":"Matthias Schenk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67e177ba844f85752dc70abc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolf Hitler","original_name":"Adolf Hitler","popularity":0.7926,"profile_path":"/n6f81IUSes1a8jTzUIF7rJ5zZnP.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67e17bb11c3663cb814d8cfe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1639867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dietrich Schubert","original_name":"Dietrich Schubert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67e17bcd1b335d571c4d7fd9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinrich Himmler","original_name":"Heinrich Himmler","popularity":0.3017,"profile_path":"/Aljparz5AOPTPrgVFDFahutWBak.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"67e17c091f256aef1cc714b9","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1639867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dietrich Schubert","original_name":"Dietrich Schubert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e1789ce4a9c86906082066","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5325499,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ingrid Terheggen","original_name":"Ingrid Terheggen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e178b71f256aef1cc713d2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1639867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dietrich Schubert","original_name":"Dietrich Schubert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e178d1844f85752dc70aef","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5325501,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andreas Fragl","original_name":"Andreas Fragl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e1797e1f256aef1cc7141b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5325505,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Wilfried Kaute","original_name":"Wilfried Kaute","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e179ad844f85752dc70b42","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1639867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dietrich Schubert","original_name":"Dietrich Schubert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e17c48b8e0fea934082c77","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3034458","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1575,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7h5Sc1YS9br07ilv3vEfZTkO0Ak.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2800}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/t1CsPsSdVpURy4K0kfEPcx5WEzV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1739,"name":"holocaust (shoah)"},{"id":279911,"name":"nazi germany"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"6","descriptors":["Stressful Scenes","Violence"],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2002-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Story of Mathias Schenk","key":"GJrWZkU4KCI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2021-07-30T18:00:12.000Z","id":"67e1804c1c3663cb814d8f6d"}]}}}
