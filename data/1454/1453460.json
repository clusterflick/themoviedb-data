Battling his inner demons, existential despair, and profound solitude, 'X' discovers unexpected companionship and encounters glimpses of beauty and hope in the infinite vastness of space.  Distance to the Moon is a short stop motion animated film taking its cue from the early sci-fi aesthetic, pioneered by early film makers such as Frizt Langs, Metropolis and later the Hitchcock films but with an unexpected absurdist twist inspired by the writers such as Samuel Beckett and Italo Calvino's Cosmicomics.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":257357,"logo_path":null,"name":"Curious Dreamers","origin_country":""},{"id":108818,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eyebolls","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Distance to the Moon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5325397,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sacha Kyle","original_name":"Sacha Kyle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e16db71c3663cb814d8a1e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2127268,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victoria Watson","original_name":"Victoria Watson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e16dcece605a1ed1c757ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
