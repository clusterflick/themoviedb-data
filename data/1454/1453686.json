He unlocked a door and invited everyone in. After many lifespans and a churning stream of visitors, we step through to find Tina, Chelsea, and Phoebe. One retired from government work who uses her hourly wages from Target to buy paint and canvas, another diagnosed with Asperger’s lives and works on the top floor of her mother’s row house with many pet rats, and the third a polymath, with a decade of advanced medical training, a stint in adult entertainment, and thirteen years of recovery from heroin addiction. They are both together and apart, infused with a spirit we can’t see or touch, scraping colors, moving in circles, as we wait for faces shimmering in the distance to enter.  \"A brilliant new work. Film as medicine.\" - Cherry
