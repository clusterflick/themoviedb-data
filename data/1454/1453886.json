The only problem? He's introverted. They haven't booked a single show yet. And his girlfriend wants them to leave the only town he's ever known. A town where he struggles with the complicated, co-dependent relationship with his parents, who both live with cerebral palsy. Mildlife is a coming-of-age film that follows Lawrence, as he navigates every (not so?) simple decision... one scream at a time.","popularity":0.6382,"poster_path":"/hy2o5nRNmgwauc7qX6G3JyhB25D.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mildlife","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3732460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivy Charles","original_name":"Ivy Charles","popularity":0.0507,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Julie","credit_id":"67e290abeba79f6ff7f0910a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5326988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lianne Crowe","original_name":"Lianne Crowe","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Karen","credit_id":"67e290ba16a3c5c224f0606e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5326989,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Grant Warren","original_name":"Adam Grant Warren","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Jim","credit_id":"67e290cad70c61590375e41c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4265724,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cory Thibert","original_name":"Cory Thibert","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Lawrence","credit_id":"67e290d7e28af41cfc75f41a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4265724,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cory Thibert","original_name":"Cory Thibert","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e29016a63bcc4997dc69b4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4265724,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cory Thibert","original_name":"Cory Thibert","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e290264c52746665dc8834","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4265724,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cory Thibert","original_name":"Cory Thibert","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e2903fd70c61590375e387","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2543759,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucy McNulty","original_name":"Lucy McNulty","popularity":0.2338,"profile_path":"/x69Sc12KHK4NUzryhavNQ1zPd3D.jpg","credit_id":"67e29052e28af41cfc75f3f6","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5326981,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Geoff McCaldin","original_name":"Geoff McCaldin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e29067440f311ace75e66f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":1730,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hy2o5nRNmgwauc7qX6G3JyhB25D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1170}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4048,"name":"musician"},{"id":162735,"name":"disability"},{"id":325355,"name":"canadian"},{"id":327432,"name":"disabilityinclusion"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
