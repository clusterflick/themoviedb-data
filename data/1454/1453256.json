The lining was placed there by conservationists in order to mitigate the invasive Common Reed, which is killing native plants. However, the lining also interferes with wildlife and contaminates the water. The film’s title references Roland Barthes' 1957 essay, \"Plastic,\" in which he writes, “The hierarchy of substances is abolished: a single one replaces them all: the whole world can be plasticized, and even life itself since, we are told, they are beginning to make plastic aortas.” 65 years after Barthes’ essay was published, in 2022, microplastics were found in human blood and, in 2023, in human heart tissue. In this 16mm film, tension rises between the benefits and hazards of plastic or, as Barthes describes, between plastic and “life itself.”","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plastic Aortas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1973522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Malic Amalya","original_name":"Malic Amalya","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e0c6124ce07d684e07f43f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1973522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Malic Amalya","original_name":"Malic Amalya","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e0c619c2d819df69c7522b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1973522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Malic Amalya","original_name":"Malic Amalya","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e0c6224ce07d684e07f451","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1973522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Malic Amalya","original_name":"Malic Amalya","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e0c62b1f256aef1cc6f929","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5324419,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Clovis Stocchetti","original_name":"Clovis Stocchetti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e0c639c2d819df69c7523f","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5324419,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Clovis Stocchetti","original_name":"Clovis Stocchetti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e0c64735bd26a7d94dbdd5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
