In Call of Duty: Warzone, communication is fractured, making it even harder to truly know those you play with. Dialogue is just a series of terse exchanges of orders and instructions; everything revolves around the game, everything is subsumed by war. Forming a meaningful connection with an anonymous player seems nearly impossible. In The Zone, the protagonists confront this challenge, pushing beyond the fleeting interactions dictated by random matchmaking. They seek to reclaim their humanity, engaging with pressing themes — religion, terrorism, and representation — subtly embedded in the game’s mechanics and geography.","popularity":0.3763,"poster_path":"/8Chcg2HU6R675SdTWCZXbVwwGDa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2025-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Zone","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5324297,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniele Imani Nobar","original_name":"Daniele Imani Nobar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bZACwjDwgdetlWIvyMu6lhqWyBL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"CodGamer","credit_id":"67e0abdbc0b4387a6ec73967","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5324298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jibi","original_name":"Jibi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"nikomok69008","credit_id":"67e0ac121f256aef1cc6f578","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5324297,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniele Imani Nobar","original_name":"Daniele Imani Nobar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bZACwjDwgdetlWIvyMu6lhqWyBL.jpg","credit_id":"67e0ac28210fa80a0f4db8af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pGvH2ZIOqlIuDIApgJML35UPMO0.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8Chcg2HU6R675SdTWCZXbVwwGDa.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1944}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":789,"name":"muslim"},{"id":1242,"name":"war on terror"},{"id":187,"name":"islam"},{"id":11001,"name":"religion"},{"id":13015,"name":"terrorism"},{"id":164022,"name":"machinima"},{"id":214463,"name":"post 9/11"},{"id":329815,"name":"call of duty"},{"id":349061,"name":"warzone"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Milan Machinima Festival","release_date":"2025-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
