Matched with a Predator exposes the crimes of prolific romance fraudster Christopher Harkins.  Harkins stalked dating apps in search of his prey: attractive, smart, career-driven women. His charming, successful and generous front concealed a darker truth, as he stole from and abused women he’d met online, and was found guilty in one case of rape. This is the story of those same women’s fight to be heard when their initial police complaints went nowhere, and of their fight for justice against this insidious form of male violence.","popularity":0.0398,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3712,"logo_path":"/7PdJYn2l0iBViud7oqxRHO9UEIR.png","name":"BBC Scotland","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Matched with a Predator","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5326453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catriona MacPhee","original_name":"Catriona MacPhee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Reporter","credit_id":"67e20754d70c61590375d13d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5085854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Coburn","original_name":"Rachel Coburn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e207cfd4052f4793dc59f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5085854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Coburn","original_name":"Rachel Coburn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e207dceba79f6ff7f05ef6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3426758,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shelley Jofre","original_name":"Shelley Jofre","popularity":0.061,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e207eeeba79f6ff7f05f05","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
