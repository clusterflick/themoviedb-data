However, he is suspicious of his father, who has nothing to do with boxing. \"Where did the hot boxing referee's blood flowing in my body come from?\"  Jin-su turns his gaze to the three uncles who used to be around his mother. Seong-jin, Bi-chan, and Wang-gu. They are all uncles who only look at their mother and exercise at the boxing gym that their grandfather used to run. Jin-su sees from these uncles the qualities that a boxing referee must have and learns the whole story. On the day his mother announced her marriage to the three people, everything happened because of that.","popularity":0.172,"poster_path":"/1AcncNS3Xh7AhUtqscSMM5fF0tF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":257392,"logo_path":null,"name":"Taewon Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2001-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Why Do I Want to Be a Boxing Referee?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Park Won-sang","original_name":"박원상","popularity":0.5942,"profile_path":"/1BUaoK9hmgayqrXUzbRezKLoyZQ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Innovation Station","credit_id":"67e1ad26d70c61590375be07","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3205056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Park Dong-bin","original_name":"Park Dong-bin","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/9tH7rX4tpBFGQPi4L1HaJtg4FQe.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Sung-jin","credit_id":"67e1ad5fec98bf0a0d75bdcb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5325796,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jo Joong-hwi","original_name":"Jo Joong-hwi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Jin-soo","credit_id":"67e1ad7a0ee53d4e71f04466","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138531,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Soo-ro","original_name":"김수로","popularity":0.4289,"profile_path":"/fWyRbAX57XJsvQ7dRRzco6XquEN.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Wang Gu","credit_id":"67e1adbbd4052f4793dc4f53","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gong Hyung-jin","original_name":"공형진","popularity":0.4383,"profile_path":"/Qr28OEOVsWTkoZOdJo11VSQmQn.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Bi-chan","credit_id":"67e1ade97db9e70c47dc4c55","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3998974,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Choi Ik-hwan","original_name":"Choi Ik-hwan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e1ac574c52746665dc54ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5325784,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Choi Ik-hwan","original_name":"Choi Ik-hwan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e1ac70eba79f6ff7f04553","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5325786,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kim Seon-min","original_name":"Kim Seon-min","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e1ac8e16a3c5c224f04150","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5325787,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kim Song-hyun","original_name":"Kim Song-hyun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e1aca64c52746665dc54ba","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5325788,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kim Yong-heung","original_name":"Kim Yong-heung","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e1acc10ee53d4e71f0442a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":754,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/66TP53FaxTXmvMpck7B4wfsCG9B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1341},{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":753,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gmWbRdEopVXigd9H0D3djo4cTOm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1340},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":761,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/weWrJTvNgalIHhHFxNm6U7JUJ0C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":1354}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":779,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1AcncNS3Xh7AhUtqscSMM5fF0tF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":519}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"The 3rd Jeonju Independent Film Festival ","release_date":"2001-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
