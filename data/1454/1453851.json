No woman is safe from the dissolute Duke of Mantua, who dreams of naked, languid beauties. But he also complains about their capriciousness. The women in the film refer to famous paintings: by Matisse, Botticelli, Degas. The film is a trip through male fantasies, seen through the eyes of a woman.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Woman is Fickle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":587306,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Monique Renault","original_name":"Monique Renault","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e276df440f311ace75e27d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
