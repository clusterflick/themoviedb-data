Jacoby","overview":"Robert D. Jacoby was a veteran, firefighter, instructor, engineer, the list can go on and on. Above all, he was our grandfather. He valued family most of all, and his legacy will live on forever.  Unfortunately he passed away shortly after seeing the final cut of this documentary, but his life was nothing short of inspirational.  November 1, 1932 - March 3, 2025  I was lucky to interview my grandfather over the course of a few months, going to the firehouse, sifting through his photo albums, and hearing stories I had never heard before. Nothing more noteworthy than spending time with him during his final months. I hope this documentary serves well in honoring his extraordinary life, and it paints the picture of what kind of man he was.  “Once a Chief, always a Chief”  -Chief Robert D.
