She will collaborate with Sonja, a 72-year-old Belgrade native, anti-Milosevic activist, and retired dancer who famously performed at the last Youth Day celebration in 1988, just before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the beginning of the Yugoslav wars. Working together in a studio located in the utopian architecture of socialist modernism, they delve into experiences of utopia and dystopia, age, gender, and race. The liberal idea of freedom, celebrated in the last Youth Day performance, is hindered for various reasons. Whose freedom is it, then? Who has and who does not have the right to it? These are the questions that Body in Plural opens up through the relations between the female body, architecture, and ideology.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":48686,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bocalupo Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":140727,"logo_path":null,"name":"Theory at Work","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":257318,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fiskultura Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Body in Plural","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1318946,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marta Popivoda","original_name":"Marta Popivoda","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e0f4c5b8e0fea9340813e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1318946,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marta Popivoda","original_name":"Marta Popivoda","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e0f4ceb8e0fea9340813ea","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1318949,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ana Vujanović","original_name":"Ana Vujanović","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e0f4d8b8e0fea9340813ee","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1391826,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jasmina Sijerčič","original_name":"Jasmina Sijerčič","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e0f4e61f256aef1cc6fcc8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1318946,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marta Popivoda","original_name":"Marta Popivoda","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e0f4ee968ee208674d7b80","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732116,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zsofi Lili Kovacs","original_name":"Zsofi Lili Kovacs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e0f4f9978bda8ae24dc4e9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
