The dancers don’t have to be exactly together. They can dance like a flock of birds, when they suddenly take off.” A work for eleven dancers, the rhythm for \"Beach Birds\" was much more fluid than other Cunningham dances, so that the sections could differ in length from performance to performance. John Cage composed the music, and painter Marsha Skinner provided the costumes and décor. The dancers were dressed identically in all white leotards and tights, with black gloves. Skinner’s backcloth was a white scrim on which the light varied in color and intensity, decided by a lighting plot that was devised using chance methods. While the timings did not relate to the dance structure, the gradual changes of light have been interpreted to imitate those that might occur from dawn to dusk on a beach.","popularity":0.0973,"poster_path":"/aLMnQAVVA3K1kxdGcopW4bvKpic.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Beach Birds for Camera","title":"Beach Birds for Camera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1118807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Cage","original_name":"John Cage","popularity":0.1503,"profile_path":"/9gmtnfJV6dO81hNzxr2Nm3UGeNv.jpg","credit_id":"647a919d0e29a20133c32bad","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1248661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Merce Cunningham","original_name":"Merce Cunningham","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647a917193828e00a7640b52","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2794249,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Elliot Caplan","original_name":"Elliot Caplan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647a91cfcaef2d00aa422f74","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0103781","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aLMnQAVVA3K1kxdGcopW4bvKpic.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1992-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
