The piece further looks at the political and social implications, parallels, and escapism in the movie. The piece spends much of its screen time on how 'It Came From Outer Space' echoed and influenced the genre, its legacy, performances, adherence to Ray Bradbury's source material, 3D photography and presentation, score and effects, and more. This is a quality piece that informs and entertains alike, one that fascinatingly examines the film, and others like it, as both entertainment and echoes of real life.","popularity":0.4318,"poster_path":"/o1r1KkfJamVzbIncczwm3xKMuot.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3487,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Home Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Universe According to Universal","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudy Behlmer","original_name":"Rudy Behlmer","popularity":0.2633,"profile_path":"/tYldiJSSyaInn7POvgIXKKii1s5.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5d34956a2f8d095259df0c6d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2367602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent Di Fate","original_name":"Vincent Di Fate","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d34957d6a300b11afaa944a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Burns","original_name":"Bob Burns","popularity":0.1679,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63e5b8add29bdd008c9d6b68","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":54885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Schecter","original_name":"David Schecter","popularity":0.0654,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d3495b4caab6d77939c47ec","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":30813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul M.
