In the local town resident Mr Huseevo is a kindly man, gentle with his friends which he has many and always keeps an open house to people in need. Or at least he would if this were true, but it's not. No, Mr Huseevo is not a very pleasant man at all. A miser. He wants to be left alone, he's thoroughly irritated by people.
