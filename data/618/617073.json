When Stephanie comes to Jimmy's cabin to report a supposed plot against him, he acts as though he intends to assault her. She nearly throws herself out the window but is stopped by Jimmy, who explains that he is working on a novel and merely wanted to determine a young girl's reactions. In retaliation, she orders that he be kidnapped and held in a nearby cabin, but remorsefully nurses him back to health when he is shot trying to escape.","popularity":0.1001,"poster_path":"/6UsNE3hFlF3bZwwkKdPLEdTFCEW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31789,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goldwyn Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Back to the Woods","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mabel Normand","original_name":"Mabel Normand","popularity":0.1646,"profile_path":"/7aSeqYhxHaqd0wCHE9yaXu9XWOV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Stephanie Trent","credit_id":"5d3392196a300b11afa7ca99","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert Rawlinson","original_name":"Herbert Rawlinson","popularity":0.2357,"profile_path":"/siWyKk2R5OfDhdJHYtlAPdYuXAc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jimmy Raymond","credit_id":"5d339220caab6d0b29a83db0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Housman","original_name":"Arthur Housman","popularity":0.1236,"profile_path":"/2fPg5nQenEcivr5yAHDafZP76h9.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Bill Andrews","credit_id":"5d339246ae6f09000f7c8569","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2366888,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Laffey","original_name":"James Laffey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5d33924fcaab6d7793996afd","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362935,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"J.
