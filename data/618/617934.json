These innovators rejected the European modernism of Mies and Corbusier in search of alternative directions. Since then their work has made architectural history and has influenced many young architects. Philip Johnson comments throughout the film. The architects show us and discuss their buildings of the time on location and in their offices.","popularity":0.1101,"poster_path":"/6Q3SDYBEJUhIRoZ9nYrorB8ZtZd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond Utopia: Changing Attitudes in American Architecture","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1264965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Blackwood","original_name":"Michael Blackwood","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":"/8R0NnxYVOuWqX5PvIvA0vmmLqh5.jpg","credit_id":"5e4830b0134d5800182ff1fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6Q3SDYBEJUhIRoZ9nYrorB8ZtZd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
