One cold winter morning, Dr. Fleischmann (literally, ‘man of flesh') realizes he is starting to lose his memory. So begins a morality tale, in a dream-like state in which truth and fiction become entangled and lose their contours. The main character, a scientist, is reluctantly drawn into a world - his disease - in which mysterious bonds prevail: those between fate and the biological and physiological criteria that regulate existence. The film is based on a story of the same name by Giorgio Pressburger.","popularity":0.0945,"poster_path":"/6LuuRM7RKqR11NGwyLltayLfqRd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121139,"logo_path":null,"name":"VOX
