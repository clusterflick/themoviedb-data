He becomes excited about the idea, and becomes a little careless. The hood of the car, crashes down on his head, knocking him out cold. While unconcious, he dreams about being a worker among ants in the state-controlled nation of Antrolia. At first he is enthusiastic, but soon becomes disenchanted. When he threatens to strike, the soldier ants drag him before a firing squad. Just as he is being executed, he wakes up. He jumps into the car, races to the radio station and assaults the speaker, who is still extolling the virtures of state-planning boards and a controlled, planned economy. The speech, on red paper, flies into the air, as the mechanic grabs the microphone to give the audience \"the real low-down on them ants\".","popularity":0.1961,"poster_path":"/5tJSYEGVsFWUZAhTyX0FO6vjmqs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13409,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harding College","origin_country":""},{"id":13410,"logo_path":null,"name":"John Sutherland Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1950-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Patriotic Animated Cartoon","title":"Albert in Blunderland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daws Butler","original_name":"Daws Butler","popularity":0.4715,"profile_path":"/qxaOMbICdts0qpUmkYj3OMhDGt8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Albert / Movie Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5d339b57ae6f09261b7b8bb6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Graham","original_name":"Frank Graham","popularity":0.1143,"profile_path":"/eyk6QL2NR8Ay4AlrAHYyqcRtMqY.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Planning Board Ant / Ant Guards (voice)","credit_id":"5d339b6bae6f0900107c96d0","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daws Butler","original_name":"Daws Butler","popularity":0.4715,"profile_path":"/qxaOMbICdts0qpUmkYj3OMhDGt8.jpg","credit_id":"5d339a7dcaab6d0b29a85193","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Graham","original_name":"Frank Graham","popularity":0.1143,"profile_path":"/eyk6QL2NR8Ay4AlrAHYyqcRtMqY.jpg","credit_id":"5d339ab3ae6f09000f7c97eb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224803,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Gordon","original_name":"George Gordon","popularity":0.0547,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d339a382f8d095259dc4de5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9397778","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5tJSYEGVsFWUZAhTyX0FO6vjmqs.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1950-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Albert in Blunderland","key":"XFF-Y7yXCp4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-09-27T12:05:58.000Z","id":"5d339b332f8d095259dc5049"}]}}}
