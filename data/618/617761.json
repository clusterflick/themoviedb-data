In each sequence, the screen is masked out to reveal the prior sequence: each audience is successively watching the killings that we, the actual audience, have just seen. The onscreen audience never leaves the theatre – there’s nowhere else in this world beyond the cinema, and the scenes of entrapment and containment play out in similarly-framed spaces of chaos (what if what we watched onscreen leaked out?). Without a scrap of ideology-addled earnestness, the tone moves from playful to inevitable. Like a game, it all loops together in an oddly fun, self-sustaining spiral of dramatic irony.","popularity":0.0899,"poster_path":"/fZmDizcrUv8LXEJuHPdUDPz1lmh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Runtime","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2369338,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Conor Bateman","original_name":"Conor Bateman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a9975d3d4d96002e6b7926","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2369338,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Conor Bateman","original_name":"Conor Bateman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d37220fab6849000f85fdec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fZmDizcrUv8LXEJuHPdUDPz1lmh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
