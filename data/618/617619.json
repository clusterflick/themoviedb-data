Resentful of her modest circumstances, Lily accepts her friend Marion Garland's offer to introduce her to Mrs. Farington, a woman who will pay handsomely for Lily's escort services. Lily goes to work for Mrs. Farington while her unsuspecting husband struggles to regain his former wealth. While managing an apartment house for one of his wealthy clients, Fred visits Mrs. Farington, a tenant, and, noticing a framed picture of Lily, asks to be introduced to the girl. Mrs. Farington arranges the rendezvous, and when Lily arrives, she is confronted by her enraged husband who chokes her to death. At this moment, Lily awakens from her nightmare, and chastened for her superficiality, begs Fred for forgiveness.","popularity":0.332,"poster_path":"/9afOi2uMbLW1AOCknLfzyt1tHmc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":258008,"logo_path":null,"name":"To-Day Feature Film Corp.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"She Sold Her Soul for a Jeweled Dress!","title":"To-Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1121337,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Reed","original_name":"Florence Reed","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/cyQ7w2VwvHckjePVdJXqhamqs14.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Lily Morton","credit_id":"5d364048ae6f09001f69d7ed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1794299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Mills","original_name":"Frank Mills","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/bKejLKY0nrVHRmc0gtMXVidy4Oh.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Fred Morton","credit_id":"5d364053c92c5d0017d73310","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1630516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Lambart","original_name":"Harry Lambart","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/7F9PRiyucUf2xkOPsdhYBvIGgXw.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Richard Hewlett (as Captain Harry Lambert)","credit_id":"5d364099c92c5d000fd73510","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Lester","original_name":"Kate Lester","popularity":0.1738,"profile_path":"/l8eowUVHdJd3cs9St9CU8wWB3K3.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Mrs. Farington","credit_id":"5d3640a141465c00220e17a0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1690202,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gus Weinberg","original_name":"Gus Weinberg","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Henry Morton","credit_id":"5d36405a41465c002a0e1a37","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2368713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Gale","original_name":"Alice Gale","popularity":0.0484,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Emma Morton","credit_id":"5d36406841465c002a0e1a44","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2368714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonora Harris","original_name":"Leonora Harris","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Marion Garland (as Lenore Harris)","credit_id":"5d364085ae6f09001769dc5b","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1345306,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"George Broadhurst","original_name":"George Broadhurst","popularity":0.1105,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d363f2dae6f09000e69d706","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Ince","original_name":"Ralph Ince","popularity":0.1863,"profile_path":"/73Dd6TNh5Ji2JQsj63JoxJ53sbo.jpg","credit_id":"5d363f88ae6f09001f69d685","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Ince","original_name":"Ralph Ince","popularity":0.1863,"profile_path":"/73Dd6TNh5Ji2JQsj63JoxJ53sbo.jpg","credit_id":"5d3640060d9f5a0019c7e5a9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1404157,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"André Barlatier","original_name":"André Barlatier","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d364010ae6f09002769d841","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1345305,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Abraham S.
