While he rises and falls, watched by the impassive but attentive look of a woman who could be his wife, he is the protagonist of a flight into the past. Again, there is tension emphasized by an impending sound in crescendo, this time the one of the jet engine. This jump into the void is a recurrent creative preoccupation that might refer to distance, wounds, and risks.","popularity":0.061,"poster_path":"/rzNbleShvcxuo0GmuL5QiueK91E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"90 Years","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1076458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Schwartz","original_name":"Jonathan Schwartz","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/jjwg4vxuMzO20UnuCAqLq8cBJVi.jpg","credit_id":"5d357513befb090013b91f01","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":904,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rzNbleShvcxuo0GmuL5QiueK91E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":603}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
