With their two daughters Annika 15 and Liv 12 and their 37 dogs, the Olesens enjoy a unique lifestyle in the wide open wilderness far away from civilization. One winter they all leave their self-built homestead with ten dogs on a two and a half thousand mile family expedition allowing Annika to run the Junior Iditarod in Alaska. As unexpected obstacles all along the trip culminate in three heavily injured dogs the whole endeavor is at risk. Optimism, love and loyalty prevail on this exciting epic family voyage.","popularity":0.4121,"poster_path":"/7Tuo342heanPmWhrGRzUMkE9vIV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121087,"logo_path":null,"name":"DreamTeam media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2013-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Not Without My Dogs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2368333,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ralf Breier","original_name":"Ralf Breier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d35bafe2f8d097bccd6d783","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2368334,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claudia Kuhland","original_name":"Claudia Kuhland","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d35ba94caab6d56389593bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1882445,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Volker Gehrke","original_name":"Volker Gehrke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d35bb4fcaab6d1640b095de","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2368333,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ralf Breier","original_name":"Ralf Breier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d35baa7befb090011b9e9d9","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1162748,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hajo Schomerus","original_name":"Hajo Schomerus","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d35baefbefb0957fbb89a31","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2368333,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ralf Breier","original_name":"Ralf Breier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d35ba88caab6d35809b62ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2368334,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claudia Kuhland","original_name":"Claudia Kuhland","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d35ba9dcaab6d56389593c0","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3447712","wikidata_id":"Q59738868","facebook_id":"DieFamilieMitDenSchlittenhunden","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7Tuo342heanPmWhrGRzUMkE9vIV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1407}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6411,"name":"dog-sledding race"},{"id":8721,"name":"arctic polar circle region"},{"id":15162,"name":"dog"},{"id":18035,"name":"family"},{"id":18330,"name":"nature"},{"id":155821,"name":"sled dogs"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
