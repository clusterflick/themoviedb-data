The film's structure is drawn from road signs found as fragments of a trip, with the quotidian images - of landscapes, city life, children playing, a wedding - collected like a diary in a combination of richly saturated colour and high-contrast black-and-white footage. In contrast to the emotive quality of the imagery and music, the voice-over/text provides a dispassionate and chilling guide on what to expect and how to behave in times of war.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2367157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Enrico Mandirola","original_name":"Enrico Mandirola","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d33eea3caab6d77939a5a9a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
