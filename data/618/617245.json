He, like so many of us around the world, was deeply affected by the disaster. Years later, as splintered and mangled timber and other objects started to wash ashore, the disaster hit home again for Clarkson, and the inspiration for his memorial was born. In Clarksonâ€™s caring hands, the remnants from the Tohoku region take on a life of their own as he shapes them into a unique public sculpture. The result is an evocative memorial that is a site of remembrance and contemplation, and an emotional bridge connecting an artist, his community and a people an ocean away.","popularity":0.6178,"poster_path":"/3YPFwCQoBAH7tBcDDx3eLz2HHA0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2015-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Debris","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2313442,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Chris McLaren","original_name":"Chris McLaren","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651c90cdea84c7010c148f56","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2712933,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Teri Snelgrove","original_name":"Teri Snelgrove","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651c909aea84c7010c148f4b","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2056802,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Roderick Matte","original_name":"Roderick Matte","popularity":0.062,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651c90dbc50ad2012c1acc7e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2712945,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jennifer Roworth","original_name":"Jennifer Roworth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651c9125c50ad200eac000dd","department":"Production","job":"Administration"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4304350,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tracy Sitter","original_name":"Tracy Sitter","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651c90f1ea84c700eb9b0b28","department":"Crew","job":"Transcriptions"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1901652,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jenn Strom","original_name":"Jenn Strom","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651c90a4c50ad200c91d1c15","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2313442,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Chris McLaren","original_name":"Chris McLaren","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651c91038c22c000e60292da","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mix Technician"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1029851,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrew Coppin","original_name":"Andrew Coppin","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651c90b68c22c0013d124e1b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2933954,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Wes Machnikowski","original_name":"Wes Machnikowski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651c9114ea84c700aeeb78cc","department":"Crew","job":"Technical Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2045893,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Laird Pierce","original_name":"Laird Pierce","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651c90e58c22c00103642394","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":563630,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shirley Vercruysse","original_name":"Shirley Vercruysse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651c909207216600ff375a72","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3472240,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Scott Morgan","original_name":"Scott Morgan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651c90c48c22c000b19bfcb7","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1986410,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jeff Henschel","original_name":"Jeff Henschel","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651c90d365c26c00c7d4ac18","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2114392,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kathleen S.
