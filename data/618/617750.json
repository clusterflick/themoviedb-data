Guido Crepax picks up on this energy and transfers it to a comic strip in which art, music, design, film and fashion all blend together, breaking with traditional narrative structure. The dreamy photographer Valentina becomes Crepax' alter ego: as lovely as Louise Brooks, as disturbing as one of Lucio Fontana's slashed canvases, as knowing as Bob Dylan's lyrics, and as freewheeling as Charlie Parker's compositions.","popularity":0.4594,"poster_path":"/rVxTSV6nINKSi9Ocp4ps9JA6hSu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121120,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bizef
