A window to the lives of seven women from the same city where nothing is exactly as it seems and reality is often hidden behind illusions. It's a female centric-film showcasing about a group of ordinary women (within a range of ages), and their different styles of daily life, showcasing their stories and the impact they have on society as real, everyday women. We are living in a era of the importance and empowerment of women throughout the world, and this documentary aims to convey ideas and topics to be felt, absorbed and discussed.","popularity":0.2016,"poster_path":"/fO1WjaGGMuhhx9rixkNRHWwH3Wm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121171,"logo_path":null,"name":"Green Box","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-01","revenue":101211,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tattoo Girls","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3148280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kasia Dominiak","original_name":"Kasia Dominiak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"60e4c6c34ca676005e16638a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3148283,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Agnieszka Pawłowska","original_name":"Agnieszka Pawłowska","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/m9XwxzgNP6CIS23NubcsrMbqA3B.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"60e4c6f322e480002df0e66c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3148285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agata Wisniewska","original_name":"Agata Wisniewska","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"60e4c7056ee3d70075423602","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3148287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katarzyna Hubinska","original_name":"Katarzyna Hubinska","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"60e4c7272811a10027ab2ac0","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557218,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miguel Gaudêncio","original_name":"Miguel Gaudêncio","popularity":0.0603,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d3828b5ab684974f589f4c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557218,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miguel Gaudêncio","original_name":"Miguel Gaudêncio","popularity":0.0603,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d3828bcab684900128a04ad","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5601424","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"tattoogirlsdocumentary","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fO1WjaGGMuhhx9rixkNRHWwH3Wm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":331,"name":"tattoo"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2018-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
