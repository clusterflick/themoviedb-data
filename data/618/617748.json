The professors are as skeptical as can be expected about a student who has repeated the year more than once, but the boy isn't intimidated and delivers his oral report about history, his own personal history, marred by a tragedy, and then moves on to discuss the human body and the sculpture The Veiled Christ. The teachers hear him out in silence; a passing grade is all he asks for. The film was conceived and produced as part of a film production course at Vodisca Teatro / La Scugnizzeria held by Gianluca Arcopinto and Vincenzo Marra.","popularity":0.0604,"poster_path":"/oOYLp7DdI9vax1M3c3QUwGVG0bh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121119,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Scugnizzeria Palabras","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2019-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sufficiente","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2369262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alessio Conte","original_name":"Alessio Conte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5d371173e54d5d20b2db3600","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agostino Chiummariello","original_name":"Agostino Chiummariello","popularity":0.0911,"profile_path":"/dGtSzzKXhu8ppQ2oW8tCYMqvMwE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5d37117d60c51d0014826465","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2216565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pina Di Gennaro","original_name":"Pina Di Gennaro","popularity":0.1555,"profile_path":"/kvLFK0AatAhyUWXpTaKk1IAUcKi.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5d371187ab6849001085b2a4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2369263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maddalena Stornaiuolo","original_name":"Maddalena Stornaiuolo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5d37118fe54d5d20b1db532e","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2369267,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rosario Esposito La Rossa","original_name":"Rosario Esposito La Rossa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d37127860c51d001282683d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2369267,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rosario Esposito La Rossa","original_name":"Rosario Esposito La Rossa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d3711d660c51d185981d6ac","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2369272,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Julien Panzarasa","original_name":"Julien Panzarasa","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d3711f6ab684974f585804e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2369275,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Giulia D'Amato","original_name":"Giulia D'Amato","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d37126a60c51d0014826853","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2369263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maddalena Stornaiuolo","original_name":"Maddalena Stornaiuolo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d3711a0e54d5d20b3db40e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2369264,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antonio Ruocco","original_name":"Antonio Ruocco","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d3711ace54d5d20b3db40fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31010,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gianluca Arcopinto","original_name":"Gianluca Arcopinto","popularity":0.1088,"profile_path":"/2sI97j4WE00lLJDFJIBhgFR8GQz.jpg","credit_id":"5d371206e54d5d20b1db5558","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2369267,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rosario Esposito La Rossa","original_name":"Rosario Esposito La Rossa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d3711e7e54d5d20b2db3ac3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oOYLp7DdI9vax1M3c3QUwGVG0bh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Giornate degli Autori","release_date":"2019-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
