Keeping himself on the sidelines, he gives way to the children to express their thoughts and dreams. Their remarks are intuitive, inquisitive, yet passionate and surprisingly mature, concerning rocky and complicated issues, ranging from racism, immigration, and identity, all the way to the possibilities of film as a medium. As time flows almost unnoticed, it is evident that these children have not only become the co-directors of this film but also the heroes of their own lives.","popularity":0.1643,"poster_path":"/kGyy9BmOM0FKPED5a3MvL3hMfRZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90409,"logo_path":null,"name":"Poulet-Malassis","origin_country":""},{"id":76921,"logo_path":"/dkPpGhEL2uQ5bmNDAqSZRFp894g.png","name":"Les
