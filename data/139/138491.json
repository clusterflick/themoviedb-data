Driving alone along the Big Sur, he flashes back to difficult memories about college, drugs, family and relationships. The flashback over, Kent is back in his car, but he loses control and crashes over an embankment. Stunned and hurt, Kent starts hitchhiking, not caring which direction. He wanders aimlessly, taking rides from strangers, never making real contact. Then he meets Julie who intrigues him and they move in together. Kent still has to find himself and the meaning of his existence.","popularity":1.1082,"poster_path":"/xF8fHysFHBbET0MSNY3NJoYr6DJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's Life's Illusions I Recall...
