The seething, slithering Mosshart donned pink hair for the occasion, while Hince exuded the rock star confidence of, well, a rock star married to a supermodel, goading the crowd and at times, holding up his guitar like a shotgun. At one point Hince managed to use the mic stand as a guitar slide, much to Mosshart’s delight. The duo was flanked by a quartet of ominous drummers for most of the evening, giving the sound and sights some added grandiosity for the special occasion.
