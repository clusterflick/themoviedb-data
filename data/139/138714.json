He shares his entire life, the apartment, even the bed with her. During the day he works at a bank. While he is at work, Daniel comes to the apartment to look after Edeltraut. He takes her to hairdresser's, goes for walks, shopping, and tidies up the apartment. But one day while Daniel is cleaning the windows, Edeltraut locks him out on the balcony and takes off. The two men go out looking for her. But what they find is not just Edeltraut, but also a tender fondness for one another, one which turns both of their lives upside down.","popularity":0.3694,"poster_path":"/nfZSDR47K9kLZZPMMQiXHpjX1GO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heavy Girls","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1109573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Bickelhaupt","original_name":"Ruth Bickelhaupt","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Edeltraut","credit_id":"52fe4c53c3a368484e1b2909","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225907,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heiko Pinkowski","original_name":"Heiko Pinkowski","popularity":0.3061,"profile_path":"/oegbhEGwKoMRdqvuDgQ4T9ZiBNT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sven","credit_id":"52fe4c53c3a368484e1b290d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1109574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Pinkowski","original_name":"Paul Pinkowski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Leo Marquardt","credit_id":"52fe4c53c3a368484e1b2911","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1109575,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Trabner","original_name":"Peter Trabner","popularity":0.1173,"profile_path":"/rXKWKrId0bmx3hfBO3alTQ0vTI7.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Daniel","credit_id":"52fe4c53c3a368484e1b2915","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1041601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Axel Ranisch","original_name":"Axel Ranisch","popularity":0.111,"profile_path":"/aXxG8UOnegjTaThAxvVAgxJGl2M.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c53c3a368484e1b2905","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2023454","wikidata_id":"Q1209919","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mpFRGFjgy1KdWndgaCeCFN2gniu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/idwVMVvyHiovoh606XAjTATwTde.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nfZSDR47K9kLZZPMMQiXHpjX1GO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":208135,"name":"gay bears"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
