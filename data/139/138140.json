Each side endeavors to gain the support of the Shawnee Indian tribes in the area. Governor William Henry Harrison enlists the aid of Steve Rubbell, whose friendship with the Shawnee chief Tecumseh goes back to childhood. Tecumseh's leadership of the Shawnee is contested by his brother, known as The Prophet, who sides with the British. Tecumseh, who grew up as a childhood playmate of Steve and of Laura McGregor, loves Steve as a brother and hopes to marry Laura. But Laura is in love with Steve. Laura's father, Shayne McGregor, secretly leads local support of the British against the Americans, even though it risks the life and love of his daughter. Everything comes to a head at the battle of Tippecanoe.","popularity":1.8927,"poster_path":"/1bz0EBewSpNOiaFxlzRDVEOgSFv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13578,"logo_path":null,"name":"Esskay Pictures Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1952-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"SHAWNEES looting...killing...burning in history's fiercest raid!","title":"Brave Warrior","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Hall","original_name":"Jon Hall","popularity":0.1534,"profile_path":"/yNrYXKw5gxY4fRbXmwoUNUY6uX8.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Steve Ruddell","credit_id":"53aa74f60e0a2646d8003214","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1229431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Silverheels","original_name":"Jay Silverheels","popularity":0.3963,"profile_path":"/rrHuwINW4UtYEurYd6jmg7cO9QM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Chief Tecumseh","credit_id":"53aa751a0e0a2646d50013fe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":103097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Larson","original_name":"Christine Larson","popularity":0.2005,"profile_path":"/lijYnaGk6eQWWpsH9eZqOhAhPp9.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Laura Macgregor","credit_id":"53aa75550e0a2646c80013a7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Ansara","original_name":"Michael Ansara","popularity":0.8827,"profile_path":"/dxViGyLrbXBXQlGXjrDmOwPaiuo.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Prophet","credit_id":"58abbc22c3a36849fe00c8f0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Cording","original_name":"Harry Cording","popularity":0.2916,"profile_path":"/4mIzjcLu6cQfRudjHs3vG3bWg5g.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Shayne MacGregor","credit_id":"58abbc32c3a3684a0a00cbe8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Seay","original_name":"James Seay","popularity":0.3304,"profile_path":"/goPFeA5iRgrkCVLmcxS42ZD9a2t.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Gov.
