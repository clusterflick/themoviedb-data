Two young Polish guys take the initiative to take the berries back and under their run away trough the rural Sweden they meet a country that is much different from the official picture. This is a story on two levels. On the upper level there is illegal hunting, intrigues and political dribbling with stocks, fake deal and plans how to get the fingers on a 5 million Euro subsidy. On the lower level in the story, we have the berry pickers who, allied with some of the locals, start the quest of finding both the treasure, the kingdom and getting a delightful revenge. And all that's available is a ton of rotten blueberries.","popularity":0.3389,"poster_path":"/qtox7iPECznUYYhLupZPEQnFb4T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135212,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Form","origin_country":""},{"id":79104,"logo_path":null,"name":"AP Mañana","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2007-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A back forest tale, straight ahead","title":"The Blueberry War","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1035465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pjotr Giro","original_name":"Pjotr Giro","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Stefan","credit_id":"5c3dac9e0e0a2654c18ecab6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2217971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Radoslaw Smuzny","original_name":"Radoslaw Smuzny","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Jerzy","credit_id":"5c3dacaf0e0a2655c48ed9b2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Göran Forsmark","original_name":"Göran Forsmark","popularity":0.2087,"profile_path":"/yAClfQZQNBh9gKmxHOK5MnJ1niw.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Svante Sedvallsson","credit_id":"5c3dacc09251416e2dad7314","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":76323,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anitta Suikkari","original_name":"Anitta Suikkari","popularity":0.1404,"profile_path":"/hySbbHlNalR5gwZq05Rs3bVFc2D.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Nadja","credit_id":"5c3dacd00e0a2654c18ecac3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2217973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Kühler","original_name":"Marie Kühler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/jjDBlyWvFYoMPiq6QqemNaNGdxP.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Ullabritten","credit_id":"5c3daceec3a368638a3e74bd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2217974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olle Söderberg","original_name":"Olle Söderberg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Ivar","credit_id":"5c3dacfc9251415524ad43a7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomas Norström","original_name":"Tomas Norström","popularity":0.2334,"profile_path":"/9Tga0GtSbeYFaIg8JCqbWR36UGQ.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"The Berry king","credit_id":"5c3dad0b0e0a2638678eb324","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1207089,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lars-Göran Pettersson","original_name":"Lars-Göran Pettersson","popularity":0.0995,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c3dac7dc3a36824ea3c5771","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1207089,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lars-Göran Pettersson","original_name":"Lars-Göran Pettersson","popularity":0.0995,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c3dac730e0a260fe68eea1f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2631532,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Glenn Lund","original_name":"Glenn Lund","popularity":0.0945,"profile_path":"/8W0vpIgLn6l4IlATMVlzqFuJgJE.jpg","credit_id":"5edbd18a726fb1001f8664cf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2668188,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peter Lund","original_name":"Peter Lund","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5edbd1c48d52c90027a47921","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0876095","wikidata_id":"Q16503276","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":731,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cw4exp6OrVtIy2gfuBdvTqM1kR8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1300}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"sv","file_path":"/qtox7iPECznUYYhLupZPEQnFb4T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
