They waterski. They dive. They are jealous. They are potential final girls. One of 'em is called Four-Eyes and has a little brother.  After hours of painful \"excitement\" with them, a friendly dead guy starts to kill off the annoying people. Instead of thanking the dead guy or making him president of the yacht club or something, a security guard calls his uncle, a buddhist exorcist.  Too bad for him that he's a crap exorcist, and doesn't survive the meeting with dead guy.","popularity":0.4957,"poster_path":"/5mT4XdNPoB8Mgfdzyo7jeY6tAIR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90175,"logo_path":null,"name":"Xeaco Holding","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1986-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Escape from Coral Cove","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1082975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elsie Chan Yik-Si","original_name":"陳奕诗","popularity":0.4999,"profile_path":"/mfpQoDIlbwfZVdYURRZjiaGMG05.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"San-San","credit_id":"58bfbdd5c3a368697b0046de","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joh Yin-Ling","original_name":"Joh Yin-Ling","popularity":0.0928,"profile_path":"/tcnGazes0yoIY5egaEKs6JqVNCq.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Chen-Chen","credit_id":"58cea912c3a368510e0233cf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1655195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Kong","original_name":"Louis Kong","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Tak Chai","credit_id":"58bfbdfe9251412e09005138","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Fong Chung-Sun","original_name":"方中信","popularity":0.9598,"profile_path":"/qQKB910E3e2YLOQs4WdaouJiFJE.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Alex (as Fu Lik)","credit_id":"58bfbe399251412e16004d80","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1025558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuen-Ching Leung","original_name":"Yuen-Ching Leung","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Irene","credit_id":"58bfbe45c3a368697b004719","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Cheung Yiu-Yeung","original_name":"張耀揚","popularity":0.7602,"profile_path":"/uxmSSLjeDW193jg7mkBjJKmzPPG.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"The Creature","credit_id":"58bfbe519251412e09005160","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1138873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wong Mei-Wa","original_name":"Wong Mei-Wa","popularity":0.0512,"profile_path":"/xRWFbRxI8o8LwU8hvtG4YCUBlWV.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Bonnie","credit_id":"58bfbe5ec3a3686967004705","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Woo Fung","original_name":"胡楓","popularity":0.898,"profile_path":"/2wKQzKdelwT7UvrsyfNxnaoChgR.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Priest Ming Suk","credit_id":"58bfbe6f9251412e0e004d91","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1084494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marilyn Bautista","original_name":"Marilyn Bautista","popularity":0.9548,"profile_path":"/lWKFCEgnf1PoFdf3waaCXl7Owtw.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Female Diver","credit_id":"58bfbe7b9251412e2a004c3a","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chun Wong","original_name":"秦煌","popularity":0.5685,"profile_path":"/dWARvyVRvBuQT2H87rUVN3hxqGq.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Mr. Chun","credit_id":"58cea988c3a36851040232e4","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1320201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yu Miu-Lin","original_name":"余慕蓮","popularity":0.2924,"profile_path":"/x94YNBCb8B7lKTKJ68lX6oNKllc.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Mr. Chun's Girlfriend","credit_id":"58cea997c3a36850e9022d19","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11404,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Terence Chang","original_name":"Terence Chang","popularity":0.4285,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57f4a4ccc3a36805590022f8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11404,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Terence Chang","original_name":"Terence Chang","popularity":0.4285,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57f4a4749251411c770022d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0092051","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.717,"height":1918,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5mT4XdNPoB8Mgfdzyo7jeY6tAIR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1375}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
