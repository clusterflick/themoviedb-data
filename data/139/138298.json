With the exception of some of the acting, Emerson Frakes was the sole creator of the film, from drawing, to editing, to the music. The process of creating the film could be compared to creating a work of art for the reasons that the creator had full control over the production, something that rarely occurs in movie making. In the age of 3D animation, Blood Trail reverts back to the roots of animation by using a hand-drawn technique which gives the viewer a unique cinematic experience. The technical aspects of the animation add a comical element that parallel the dark humor found in the story.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blood Trail","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2336213","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
