This brings her into contact with earthy, cynical hospital nurse Ernesto (Jorge Perugorria). Estela invites him home for dinner, and he succeeds in offending everyone present. Unable to find a quiet spot to be alone, they finally find a squatters' tenement, where their sexual frenzy causes a ceiling to collapse. They next try vertical love in a stalled elevator, trapping people in the modern building minus stairs. Fleeing responsibilities, they stage a romantic rendezvous alongside a country river, but once again they are interrupted as Cuban commissars arrive with papers and forms because the couple constructs a hut beneath a bridge. Amid the misadventures, lust turns to love","popularity":0.3193,"poster_path":"/dCPrFcjMF6OkTWAsj6Zsoe6VSbP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"}],"release_date":"1997-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vertical Love","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jorge Perugorría","original_name":"Jorge Perugorría","popularity":0.162,"profile_path":"/mS4bp6aj4EXSqUnXQflLf8G4LbE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ernesto Navarro Aces","credit_id":"52fe4c57c3a368484e1b34c1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":945834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Silvia Águila","original_name":"Silvia Águila","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Estela Diaz Iglesias","credit_id":"52fe4c57c3a368484e1b34c5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":941866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susana Pérez","original_name":"Susana Pérez","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Lucia","credit_id":"52fe4c57c3a368484e1b34c9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1471781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Osvaldo Doimeadiós","original_name":"Osvaldo Doimeadiós","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/ArRowpnID4JFzFt4tPDE2kiVcSf.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sgt Garrido","credit_id":"579175929251415fd8002e85","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1645289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuel Porto","original_name":"Manuel Porto","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Faustino","credit_id":"5e89b1b0cf1afd00116cb20c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1044011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aramís Delgado","original_name":"Aramís Delgado","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Tio Carlos","credit_id":"5e89b203cf1afd00116cb2aa","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1189621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katia Caso","original_name":"Katia Caso","popularity":0.0845,"profile_path":"/uAS8oMp7X9w11e2USLw79RzrHjr.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Monja","credit_id":"5e89b21ab84f940016cbd8cb","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":228997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paula Ali","original_name":"Paula Ali","popularity":0.1772,"profile_path":"/fJbEEGnRHwYykv7Ytvd4aJDFNfS.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Ernesto's Mother","credit_id":"5e89b23560b58d0015ece3cf","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1278315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ileana Wilson","original_name":"Ileana Wilson","popularity":0.0937,"profile_path":"/nALi5t9BpQAv3wUTjKeAoUMPHsj.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Gertrudis","credit_id":"5e89b24c60b58d0013ec9d19","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2590409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adriana Sánchez Estupiñan","original_name":"Adriana Sánchez Estupiñan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Mary, The Siames","credit_id":"5e89b267d207f30014989b0e","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1470067,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arturo Sotto Díaz","original_name":"Arturo Sotto Díaz","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dfc297dd1a893001283ae9d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1470067,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arturo Sotto Díaz","original_name":"Arturo Sotto Díaz","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dfc298465686e00138fb367","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0118611","wikidata_id":"Q21647279","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dCPrFcjMF6OkTWAsj6Zsoe6VSbP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"18A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
