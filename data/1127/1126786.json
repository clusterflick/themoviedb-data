A trance-like, personal story about loss, mourning & memory. The film consists of excerpts from 70 films produced by the Educational Film Studio in Lodz in the 1960s and the first radio adaptations of \"Solaris\". Lem begins writing “Solaris” the same year that Resnais' “Hiroshima Mon Amour” is released – says Kuba Mikurda – Like Resnais' film, I find “Solaris” a fascinating study of post-traumatic memory – repressed memories that pave their way into consciousness and demand to be expressed.","popularity":0.133,"poster_path":"/uC7eKeRe72GCwzPZwjVQRuFEeio.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21778,"logo_path":"/pKaywrtWfuwLKmocmexmgYLsHhf.png","name":"Lodz Film
