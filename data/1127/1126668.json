It was broadcast only in Germany at the time. By 2010, after nearly 40 years, it seemed desirable to recycle the performances and interviews with the composers and to create a revealing look back to those years for English-speaking New Music fans. The film offers valuable insights into the nature and issues of advanced composition at the beginning of the 1970s.","popularity":0.3634,"poster_path":"/5rZpShJSaXqbygLeaaD0wRYEM7z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"New Music: Sounds and Voices from the Avant-Garde New York 1971","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1551,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Philip Glass","original_name":"Philip Glass","popularity":0.2814,"profile_path":"/dsf8ajHq4BJeTHdrwcM9OW72x4R.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6460621d6e0d7200e31c976b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1450963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alvin Lucier","original_name":"Alvin Lucier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64606230dbbb42015305e9c5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1450964,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Behrman","original_name":"David Behrman","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64606239dbbb420170a8b1f2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1119269,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Steve Reich","original_name":"Steve Reich","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/74RqDTZoQHYE40VpIoLIoNqLCPH.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64606244dbbb420170a8b1ff","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1633005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gordon Mumma","original_name":"Gordon Mumma","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6460624e8c44b901706ee368","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3544268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Cage","original_name":"John Cage","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6460626fdbbb420170a8b215","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1376689,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Earle Brown","original_name":"Earle Brown","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6460628bdbbb420170a8b229","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4061237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Tudor","original_name":"David Tudor","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"646062a4e3fa2f016620d9b0","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4061239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morton Subotnik","original_name":"Morton Subotnik","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"646062c6ef8b3200e3ad3912","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1126409,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joe Jones","original_name":"Joe Jones","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"646063316e0d7200ff4b63b0","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1291830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Neuhaus","original_name":"Max Neuhaus","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64606345e3fa2f0187b85add","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4061243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Corner","original_name":"Phil Corner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"646063588c44b901364b75db","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4061244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Patterson","original_name":"Ben Patterson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64606368e3fa2f0145ec421c","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4061245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolf Rosenberg","original_name":"Wolf Rosenberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64606376ef8b3200fe7d24b5","order":13}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4061249,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans G.
