The Center will discover the story and the history of Dizengoff Center, layer by layer, from the ground it was built on, to the top floor and the secrets this place withholds. The film will travel from the past to the present in order to try and find out what makes this place so special.","popularity":0.1303,"poster_path":"/5Wiveh5B1Fzt4y4wqpZIpm6Pway.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":199993,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ben-Mayor Farag
