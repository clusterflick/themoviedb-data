More than three hundred dogs were part of the rescue and recovery operation, going where it was impossible for humans to follow. The occasional dog collapsed from exhaustion but none of them gave up. Most of these four-legged heroes are now retired but they leave behind a story that must be told. Blind office worker Michael Hingson had to trust his seeing-eye dog Roselle on a treacherous descent of 78 flights of stairs to escape only moments before the towers collapsed. Lt. David Lim of the NY Port Authority Police was called to duty with his explosive detector dog Sirius. Genelle Guzman-McMillan, the last remaining survivor of 9/11, was pinned under the rubble for 27 hours after the buildings collapsed before being found by recovery dogs.","popularity":0.1201,"poster_path":"/rxQdnUP5sG5MROecVCaJq20JG48.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hero Dogs Of 9/11","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Hero Dogs Of 9-11","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2606284","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1875,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rxQdnUP5sG5MROecVCaJq20JG48.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1275}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":161304,"name":"9/11"},{"id":315890,"name":"dogs"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
