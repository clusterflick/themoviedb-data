With the help of modern technology, the idea of a show combining breath-taking views of the solar system and beyond, played out to 42 minutes of The Dark Side Of The Moon in surround sound, has been embraced by the band. NSC Creative have led the visual production efforts, working closely with Pink Floyd’s long time creative collaborator Aubrey Powell from Hipgnosis.","popularity":1.1608,"poster_path":"/1I8wUOSacR5YLBxMZzYvVmFRlAm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107268,"logo_path":null,"name":"NSC Creative","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"50 years in a heartbeat.","title":"Pink Floyd: The Dark Side of the Moon Planetarium Experience","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Dark Side of the Moon Planetarium Experience","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Dark Side of the Moon Experience","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Dark Side of the Moon: A Pink Floyd Experience","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Dark Side of the Moon Planetarium Event","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1175195,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"James Guthrie","original_name":"James Guthrie","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/lx6QniuUQXq9xHqeVKv4nrXs8Em.jpg","credit_id":"65748c16cadb6b080e7176de","department":"Crew","job":"Mixing Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Wright","original_name":"Richard Wright","popularity":0.1596,"profile_path":"/sFuesocym7eFIyvmh327mgIOPuw.jpg","credit_id":"6642f399af8106e8edbaa033","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67273,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Waters","original_name":"Roger Waters","popularity":0.4708,"profile_path":"/wdslZ2ve8Ju44j88sXrjr3J4v6p.jpg","credit_id":"6642f332d088e74113b896d5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Mason","original_name":"Nick Mason","popularity":0.35,"profile_path":"/tqZQvpMLTtqyJW7A20nBLSrGrsr.jpg","credit_id":"6642f33b735af17a6235ba1a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Gilmour","original_name":"David Gilmour","popularity":0.545,"profile_path":"/n1KOcuMSdNHY0pewz6fEWl6zHYD.jpg","credit_id":"6642f31baf8106e8edbaa00f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28547346","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5jbkmtLLpTdXtcStD2wz92JJHu9.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tri2Hg5x3Wa3m8GNaXhMcAZlK9G.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1012,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AoIZCrMTTfE5v9bY2do626H7V2N.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1800}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1I8wUOSacR5YLBxMZzYvVmFRlAm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"at Brussel's Planetarium","release_date":"2023-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Pink Floyd - The Dark Side of the Moon - Official Planetarium Show - Trailer - Time - v3 16x9","key":"uC6deLuQKkQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-03-23T22:04:27.000Z","id":"6642f4be15201f727170efc3"}]}}}
