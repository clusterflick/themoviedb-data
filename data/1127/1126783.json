The film revolves around Marina Valcarenghi, psychotherapist and psychoanalyst with a forty-five-year career in clinical work that has allowed her to observe the persistence of women’s insecurity, despite the economic and social independence they have gradually achieved, and understand why. Valcarenghi was the first to introduce psychoanalysis in prisons, starting with the Opera and Bollate penitentiaries. For twelve years she worked with male inmates held in solitary confinement; most of them had been convicted of sexual violence.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/xIC3P3cxlCQ4tSF0PytI4zXsoE8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74065,"logo_path":"/2zMkXdiEX16WDRft4ebKqcgAxu0.png","name":"Dugong Films","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":219126,"logo_path":null,"name":"ACACIA – Associazione Amici Arte Contemporanea Italiana","origin_country":""},{"id":219127,"logo_path":null,"name":"PAC Padiglione d’Arte Contemporanea","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2023-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il popolo delle donne","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4061738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marina Valcarenghi","original_name":"Marina Valcarenghi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6460e4afa6725401221214b4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2558866,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mirko Fabbri","original_name":"Mirko Fabbri","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b15cfa15c6360193aae6b8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4497976,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Thomas Pilani","original_name":"Thomas Pilani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b15ca815c6360193aae69b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4497980,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Caterina Barbieri","original_name":"Caterina Barbieri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b15ce43c43440151662a33","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1262443,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuri Ancarani","original_name":"Yuri Ancarani","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/rEtvMeXJJJ5tJLHmVVC0AUZr7WO.jpg","credit_id":"65b15cc299c96401511f609c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1262443,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuri Ancarani","original_name":"Yuri Ancarani","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/rEtvMeXJJJ5tJLHmVVC0AUZr7WO.jpg","credit_id":"6460e4d1a67254014366d909","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mo49gEFAm3QZw85BNZTQ1EQASet.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/xIC3P3cxlCQ4tSF0PytI4zXsoE8.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1440}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"Giornate degli Autori 20th edition","release_date":"2023-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
