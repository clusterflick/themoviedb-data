Disabled Hugo Schmidt talks to the almost 90 year old Franz-Josef Sauer, who was left with a walking impairment by a tuberculosis infection in his childhood. In the 1990s Sauer received the German Federal Cross of Merit for his achievements in the disabled community. As a public servant in Münster and Düsseldorf he worked on several projects which still benefit his disabled peers. Sauer and Schmidt discover that, although they were born almost 70 years apart, their paths in life are not that different from each other.","popularity":0.1124,"poster_path":"/dtNmHhcgMhkmQFFWngqLE9ZYT2P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vertrauensmann","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4652811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugo Schmidt","original_name":"Hugo Schmidt","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"661c2f59cca7de017dca3358","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4652812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz-Josef Sauer","original_name":"Franz-Josef Sauer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"661c2f6333a5330186d5edc3","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4652811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugo Schmidt","original_name":"Hugo Schmidt","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661c2f7733a5330186d5edca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4652816,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Philipp Hermann","original_name":"Philipp Hermann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661c2fd5323eba0163763748","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4652814,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lars Engelmann","original_name":"Lars Engelmann","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661c2ff541aac40146ff2bb1","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2827,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/dtNmHhcgMhkmQFFWngqLE9ZYT2P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":159845,"name":"tuberculosis"},{"id":162735,"name":"disability"},{"id":282633,"name":"history"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
