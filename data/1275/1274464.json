The events on the turn of the century, the Balkan conflicts, World Wars I and II, the coming of communism, led Bishop Nikolai on schooling and doctorates in Europe, missionary work, humanitarian activities, quelling of hostile propaganda towards Serbia in London, work on the formation and strengthening the church in America, spiritual guidance of the church in Serbia, imprisonment and suffering, even enslavement to the infamous concentration camp Dachau. Often more respected abroad than in his own country, Bishop Nikolai died as a refugee in America.
