Positioned in the Yakutian Arctic, the film invites the viewer to ask vital questions about the meaning of peripheries and how western ontologies of discovery and the writing of history are absorbed into or contrast with immediate Yakutian realities.","popularity":0.0555,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Voyage of Jeanette","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2179973,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Svetlana Romanova","original_name":"Svetlana Romanova","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/AuKsvpRJp91x2itkuvnB58suZ30.jpg","credit_id":"661ca7d50102c9018606a9fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
