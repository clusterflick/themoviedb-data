She aspires to become part of the salon and its circle of intellectual, empowered women. Intimidated by the self-confidence of the others, she doesn’t have the courage to step on stage. To make matters worse, Lars, a self-proclaimed poet, intrudes the intimacy of the evening. He takes over the stage without invitation to speak out against women’s right to vote and shamelessly flirts with Minna. The culmination of pressure leads Minna to the stage, to vocalize her defiance against Lars and show everyone what she is really made of.","popularity":0.1318,"poster_path":"/m8Na8nkrODvBjf6o1hQ0gs487qB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":296,"logo_path":"/oPCnyumoJtIedjQoQin6zSSHkv8.png","name":"Filmakademie
