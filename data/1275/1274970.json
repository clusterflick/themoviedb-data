Reporter Kimberly Rubio rises to national prominence as an advocate for gun reform after her ten-year-old daughter, Lexi, is killed in the shooting. Through the journalists’ reporting, we witness the social fabric of this small Texas town unravel as Kimberly and other victims’ families search for accountability from law enforcement and local leaders. The documentary also shines a light on the critical role of community journalism, at a time when local newspapers are folding rapidly across the country.","popularity":0.5853,"poster_path":"/vSrjJaN2EV2ae0HWPImIHppbK92.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25992,"logo_path":"/6s8EPSIUw1APohH6lV2bsA9o3Xz.png","name":"ABC
