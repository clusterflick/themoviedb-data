Land grabbing, environmental pollution, corruption and other illegal and legal crimes cause harm to the region and its people. Unfortunately, especially in countries where these raw materials are most used and purchased, there are few reports and few people are aware of the consequences of their consumption. The jungle, on which not only animals and people but also the climate depend, is being devastated, polluted and free-flowing. This cruelty leaves a lot of suffering, injustice, environmental tragedies and deaths. This can no longer be watched in silence. The population of the Pan-Amazon region needs to be heard. Yarkày is a collection of different cases that aims to clarify and explain the situation.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/cMsPSIEmHKnFZiAtuQCxeeaYssS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yarkày: As vozes esquecidas da Amazônia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cMsPSIEmHKnFZiAtuQCxeeaYssS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
