The three segments of this magazine-format film explore the current work of historical archaeologists at three sites across the United States. Details of peoples' lives are revealed in excavations at slave quarters on St. Simon Island, slag heaps in northern California mining towns occupied between 1859-1902, and subway construction sites in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where urban archaeologists devise new methods to discover artifacts in land still used.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Other People's Garbage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1195241,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claire Andrade-Watkins","original_name":"Claire Andrade-Watkins","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661d07c860c51d01634e6190","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Odyssey Series:  Other People's Garbage - PREVIEW","key":"S_zmCD4Eojg","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2011-02-01T16:28:07.000Z","id":"661d082960c51d01864ec690"}]}}}
