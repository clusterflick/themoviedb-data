The film weaves together the voices of two women, one from the Mohawk community of Kahnawá:ke and the other an internally displaced refugee in Ramallah. Mimicking the progression of the plant’s flowers from yellow to green to red, the short film is a cyclical reflection on the connections between land, sustainability, and wild plants.","popularity":0.1096,"poster_path":"/ouhaIga8RA9G3gklG5fqojU5ubm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We would be freer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5224356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Deer","original_name":"Linda Deer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67a1f575a45287b7fde2d4d8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5224358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raya Ziada","original_name":"Raya Ziada","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67a1f5879a24fca6602621b5","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3827839,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rana Nazzal Hamadeh","original_name":"Rana Nazzal Hamadeh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661bfc9a9a64350163e0424d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ouhaIga8RA9G3gklG5fqojU5ubm.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":843,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3mLGJuqMP26E0kKPrHu4wX57S8r.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":562}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
