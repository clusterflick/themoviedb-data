Cats have their own unique and indescribable bond with people – even when living independently as community cats. For far too long, felines have been the “invisible” part of the human-animal bond and it’s time to shine the spotlight on these magnificent creatures and the humans devoted to them.  A portion of every ticket at every destination goes to a local animal welfare non-profit, bringing community awareness and support for the needs of local kitties.","popularity":0.0322,"poster_path":"/pWis2FAtGirZb1CKK9B0gmMnFzg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Collection of Short Films Exploring the Mystique of the Fascinating Felines Who Share Our Lives.","title":"2024 New York Cat Film Festival","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.682,"height":880,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pWis2FAtGirZb1CKK9B0gmMnFzg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
