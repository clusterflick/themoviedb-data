A takatāpui non-binary person has decided to go home to their marae for the first time since coming out to their everyday community. They have borne witness to homophobia and transphobia in the past from their family, and they’ve seen it on the whānau Facebook pages, so they don’t know how it’s gonna go.I think that the main character was right in being nervous to go home, because it was what they thought it was going to be. But then they find acceptance in an unexpected place.","popularity":0.0674,"poster_path":"/32ffOeDvrwPZ8mPFYwAoUziSVBA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"He Takatāpui Ahau","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5152007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jordan Walker","original_name":"Jordan Walker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Blayke","credit_id":"677529421c1d7e09cf61564e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5152008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blair Rose Kershaw","original_name":"Blair Rose Kershaw","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Kura","credit_id":"67752970e9cac07ec41304c2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3516220,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brady Peeti","original_name":"Brady Peeti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/3fSTGYHbuNkuWKEH6oDpkw4JPg7.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Huia","credit_id":"6775298e185486515d128730","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2381934,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alesha Adhar","original_name":"Alesha Adhar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661c0a9d3396b90187961396","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5152005,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Komako-aroha Silver","original_name":"Komako-aroha Silver","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6775286d185486515d1286f8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5152006,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nina Reed","original_name":"Nina Reed","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6775288098f2f82fc492b465","department":"Directing","job":"Script Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5152006,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nina Reed","original_name":"Nina Reed","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677528b52efbf3b41d92a041","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1310758,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Max Currie","original_name":"Max Currie","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/sXJl5qPWdTOOvurAWj07i688VkX.jpg","credit_id":"677529c7185486515d128746","department":"Production","job":"Production Consultant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5152009,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stephanie Escalante","original_name":"Stephanie Escalante","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67752a2497aa8e4e2c129846","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5152011,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Fred Renata","original_name":"Fred Renata","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67752a7597aa8e4e2c129885","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/32ffOeDvrwPZ8mPFYwAoUziSVBA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"TILDE Film Festival","release_date":"2024-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
