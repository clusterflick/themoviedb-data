An instrument for affirming the voice of these people is the National Indigenous Congress (CNI). Arising from the uprising of the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) and its dialogue with civil society, the CNI organized itself to demand and defend indigenous rights and cultures. Whistleblowers of political corruption have historically refused to participate in the electoral system. After twenty years of life, with much mistreatment and expropriations, the CNI believes that it is urgent to incorporate its demands into the country's agenda, and makes a change in strategy. In communities and cities across Mexico, a surprising proposal is being discussed. The people begin a firm path towards unity.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/He09RDRjIwFHJJat1lob7L1hMS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Remedio México","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/He09RDRjIwFHJJat1lob7L1hMS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
