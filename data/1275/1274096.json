It has a name: Botching. This is a story from one such 'Botch' job.  In the future Robots will preform many mundane everyday functions from delivering your parcels to security jobs. This concept came to me when I read an article in Wired magazine about the possible outcomes of hacking a robot while its building a car, or cleaning your home or more terrifyingly, in the middle of an operation on a human patient. As of today there is no slang / street word for hacking a Robots Operating System yet the implications are massive when, not if this happens. This let me to develop ‘Botching’ as a concept. A hacker would be hired for a ‘Botch Job…’ The story was simple, if I had a criminal mind and I was a bit lazy what would I do with a team of robots at my command… the outcome is limited only by your imagination.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/2ppqAhILvSBsm9bvBdwRk55wbxd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hacking a Robot for fun, or malicious intent, is dangerous, illegal, and banned globally.
