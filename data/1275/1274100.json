Yet, there is something awkward about their relationship. Nikita finds even the most innocent of touches by Neeraj to be so repulsive. Aniket, her colleague, has proposed to her and she is seriously considering it. Yet, she can’t let go of Neeraj.  Why does she seem stuck between a rock and a hard place?
