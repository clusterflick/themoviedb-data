Largely photographed in-camera, the film develops its narrative drive through the rhythm of shot length and composition. Aided by an original score from Beth Custer and a wicked sound design by Jeremiah Moore that utilizes sounds form the Cassini space probe, the piece takes on a humorously sinister tone; as if the historical marker were an alien landing.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/1jMvcK4K6tHXta2h6pHeKOqq1Zc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"You've got one shot when you put everyone on the line","title":"On the Line","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","title":"En la l√≠nea","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4654440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Travis Morris","original_name":"Travis Morris","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Michael","credit_id":"661d65f5cb6db50162096704","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4654441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tracey Graham","original_name":"Tracey Graham","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Barrett","credit_id":"661d664acb6db50162096722","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1887725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cathy Lee Crane","original_name":"Cathy Lee Crane","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/p0lx94QdW9AFk7lvtoOSFOsgx7V.jpg","credit_id":"661d6596cffeed013090df5f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4654438,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephen Gibler","original_name":"Stephen Gibler","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661d65c5389da1018636a02c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1580322","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1jMvcK4K6tHXta2h6pHeKOqq1Zc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":683}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
