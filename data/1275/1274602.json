The tape is structured as an instructional guide that advances the \"slice of life\" method, imparting not only technique, but attitude and approach to the subject of photography. Wegman plays the world-weary artiste, a professional photographer who takes the innocent and earnest Mike under his tutelage. The business of art, the \"reality\" of the photographic image, and its pervasive role in contemporary culture are among the issues that receive irreverent treatment in this comedic collaboration.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/8vMilgOqC4KMkCGUfN41uyvXl3R.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The World of Photography","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1039504,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Wegman","original_name":"William Wegman","popularity":0.0782,"profile_path":"/9ctwcHkmx2wnaTQ1HuHtXfEoztq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67b97430741152b0420a6885","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1039504,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Wegman","original_name":"William Wegman","popularity":0.0782,"profile_path":"/9ctwcHkmx2wnaTQ1HuHtXfEoztq.jpg","credit_id":"661c95420102c90186069152","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3862906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Smith","original_name":"Michael Smith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/cN1adGh06YUva1Z2s2jruX7260O.jpg","credit_id":"67b949f755dd812fad464692","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.67,"height":940,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8vMilgOqC4KMkCGUfN41uyvXl3R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":630}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
