After releasing multiple albums and EPs, they parted ways in 2007.  In 2022, the ‘Revenge is Slow’ (2002) line-up of Bluebottle Kiss announced a run of 5\r reunion shows across Australia.  These were astonishing performances, transcending the\r entire concept of reformation.  Film maker Ben deHoedt shot the band’s hometown gig in\r Sydney, resulting in the film (and accompanying live album) Bluebottle Kiss: Never Leave\r Town – Live in Sydney. Made on the fly with minimal equipment, this unadorned yet\r cinematic live document captures the rich hues, rough edges, vulnerability and vitality of\r Bluebottle Kiss as they perform some of their most accomplished material to a packed\r house over a 90 minute set.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":"/40022on18rc6ol7Sk2fZj01MJND.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Live Document By Ben de'Hoedt","title":"Bluebottle Kiss: Never Leave Town - Live in Sydney","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4651637,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben deHoedt","original_name":"Ben deHoedt","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/exrW49iBATs5mCcJOzbyOgbLZ8N.jpg","credit_id":"661b354cdaf57c017c405733","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1192,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/40022on18rc6ol7Sk2fZj01MJND.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":843},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a5mAE4sgjjer3EuFE20FMF2Lbl2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1448}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bluebottle Kiss: Never Leave Town - Live in Sydney (TRAILER)","key":"4l9XV6l8oM4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-02-17T07:59:11.000Z","id":"661b3697976a230162297d2b"}]}}}
