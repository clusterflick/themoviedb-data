Told through the voices of the artists, critics and curators who formed it, the film is narrated by voiceover culled from 30 hours of archival cassette tape interviews over a 45 year period. Artists such as Laurie Anderson, Mike Kelley, Hito Steyerl and David Wojnarowicz walk us through the decades. A formally-experimental and raucously-told chronology composed of rare archival documentation, The Business of Thought... is a reminder of the radical potential of the arts and the importance of collective, cultural spaces.","popularity":0.6492,"poster_path":"/5ZUw9MNccBayOkUNPh2qzV9hsPs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Business of Thought: A Recorded History of Artists Space","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":68929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurie Anderson","original_name":"Laurie Anderson","popularity":0.2461,"profile_path":"/qzYxlXRWKJSa8Qbwt4bcaaUVtle.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5eeb3df7b04605003607ccab","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1204210,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hito Steyerl","original_name":"Hito Steyerl","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/dL8oPhT9JdVYfPqvGUK8CrODNgY.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5eeb3e1e81da3900344f1d72","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1143741,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Wojnarowicz","original_name":"David Wojnarowicz","popularity":0.0547,"profile_path":"/aUujpjc3jDZOdQSWnB4ZVmtjaBx.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5eeb3e2bdb4ed60034cb1736","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2682850,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alexander S.C.
