On the streets during the recent protests in NYC, I felt an obligation to use my privilege to tell stories as an attempt to bridge gaps. Some might call protestors “agitators”, “trouble makers” or even “criminals”. What I found were impassioned human beings. In this piece three young leaders in the #blacklivesmatter movement are followed. There were no emails, or phone calls. I simply approached them on the street. Their passion for justice, and for reforming our beleaguered policing system was inspiring. This is meant to be a real life look in the moment and on the streetIt’s an open discussion about police violence and about protest.”","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Week In June","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2681543,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jay Sansone","original_name":"Jay Sansone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee97ecedd926a00339f3ed1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
