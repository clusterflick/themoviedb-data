Today, among the 18 people who are narrated, nine live in Germany, seven live in Switzerland and only two people stayed in Turkey. This documentary, while combining the instants, on the other hand explores the memories of the past and today through the present atmosphere and aims to answer these questions: \"Is it hard to go? To stay? Or to be together again?\"","popularity":0.124,"poster_path":"/2kxbJBjl6dOXyjqUplWSzGaqa9c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2019-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Instant","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2680674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hakan Aytekin","original_name":"Hakan Aytekin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee8c73eafa1b00021c10afa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"filmmilim","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/2kxbJBjl6dOXyjqUplWSzGaqa9c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Migration Film Festival","release_date":"2020-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
