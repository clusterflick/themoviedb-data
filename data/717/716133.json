Sharks are responsible for fewer than 10 deaths per year, so why are we so terrified of them? This programme celebrates the extraordinary array of senses and skills that have evolved over 400 million years, allowing the shark to roam not just across the tropics, but as far as the upper reaches of the Amazon and under the arctic ice! Through 8 sharks, filmed as far apart as Hawaii, Australia, South Africa and Greenland, we will change your perceptions for ever!","popularity":0.221,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Perfect Predators","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1869998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Streithorst","original_name":"Tom Streithorst","popularity":0.0889,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5ee8483cfe631800209a11b8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2680334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen M.
