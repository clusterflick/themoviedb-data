Following the disaster of the Second World War, he moved to Paris and Chicago, becoming a respected and influential historian of religions. He acquired something of the status of a guru, as poignantly told in the 1987 documentary Mircea Eliade et la redécouverte du sacré. The film features interviews with Eliade at the end of his life, artfully spliced with cuts to religious imagery on a background of moving spiritual music. It was released in 1987, the year after his death.","popularity":0.4287,"poster_path":"/dopxTUaAUtC0pVlh1RIg2uHzFT7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1579,"logo_path":"/otPDzB7wHCUsDH0BzKy3DQ7sTWP.png","name":"FR3","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":135892,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cluny Tele Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mircea Eliade et la redécouverte du sacré","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52979,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mircea Eliade","original_name":"Mircea Eliade","popularity":0.0688,"profile_path":"/te0eGxk8vwnpqLIVhtwTy2DWlzl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5eeb003ddd926a0034a24a19","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Vaneck","original_name":"Pierre Vaneck","popularity":0.1284,"profile_path":"/sX7AO0tJAnscSD7wEzq98uLM539.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5eeb014c6dea3a0034bc45e3","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2682662,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Barbăneagră","original_name":"Paul Barbăneagră","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eeb002bdb4ed60035cb2617","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2682663,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Stéfan de Fay","original_name":"Stéfan de Fay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eeb00799661fc00365cf262","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2682665,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mihaela Bacou","original_name":"Mihaela Bacou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eeb00ae9661fc00385c17d9","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2682666,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jacques Oger","original_name":"Jacques Oger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eeb00cd2dda890036b8c371","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2682667,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Florence Palou","original_name":"Florence Palou","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eeb00e49661fc00355b4423","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1121033,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gheorghe Zamfir","original_name":"Gheorghe Zamfir","popularity":0.126,"profile_path":"/ihYXOaN96nTddNOdYrwt15LBdha.jpg","credit_id":"5eeb011881da3900344ebcfd","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dopxTUaAUtC0pVlh1RIg2uHzFT7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10818,"name":"author"},{"id":171453,"name":"art history"},{"id":185663,"name":"romanian"},{"id":206291,"name":"comparative religion"},{"id":283901,"name":"historian"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"French\", \"english_name\"=>\"French\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"fr\", \"native_name\"=>\"French\"}","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
