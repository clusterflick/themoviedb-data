But a phone call from an unknown number changes everything. A woman on the line informs her that she has Kylie bound and gagged in her back seat, and the only way Rachel will see her again is to follow her instructions exactly: pay a ransom, and find another child to abduct. This is no ordinary kidnapping: the caller is a mother herself, whose son has been taken, and if Rachel doesn't do as she's told, the boy will die. Rachel is now part of The Chain, a scheme that turns victims into criminalsâ€”and is making someone else very rich in the process. The rules are simple, the moral challenges impossible; find the money fast, find your victim, and then commit an act you'd have thought yourself incapable of just 24 hours ago. But what the masterminds behind The Chain know is that parents will do anything for their children... and it turns out that kidnapping is only the beginning.","popularity":0.6672,"poster_path":"/yCGBNNnqOACCFTi0EtbDdyJVwC2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10163,"logo_path":"/16KWBMmfPX0aJzDExDrPxSLj0Pg.png","name":"Working Title Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":122772,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Story Factory","origin_country":"US"},{"id":131464,"logo_path":"/9Gk6sEs92Eshc1mZm4r2JEebran.png","name":"Complete Fiction","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Rumored","tagline":"","title":"The Chain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","title":"Zincir","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4627630,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Molly Cohen","original_name":"Molly Cohen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660aca6335818f0162390c28","department":"Production","job":"Casting Associate"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edgar Wright","original_name":"Edgar Wright","popularity":1.1853,"profile_path":"/dQzv5Ml2SkelS33hgl7E2oh0a9S.jpg","credit_id":"5eebc9cab84cdd00332c0d03","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":23447,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jane Goldman","original_name":"Jane Goldman","popularity":0.2373,"profile_path":"/p7rediE1pQuLhLjg3vXiU78Wx9x.jpg","credit_id":"5eebca05b84cdd00362be6d8","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2683482,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adrian McKinty","original_name":"Adrian McKinty","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eebca31c5ada50033d54cd0","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2238,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eric Fellner","original_name":"Eric Fellner","popularity":0.3854,"profile_path":"/8fEalki5uMWg97FVDk3l2kvf2Dt.jpg","credit_id":"5eee02ebbd990c0035fe1d6e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2236,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tim Bevan","original_name":"Tim Bevan","popularity":0.4025,"profile_path":"/nyeqZJr6QVwD3iuLgK5vRgIdcmP.jpg","credit_id":"5eee02fbb04605003510c5d5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":11112,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nira Park","original_name":"Nira Park","popularity":0.0771,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eee0309b84cdd0033328cce","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edgar Wright","original_name":"Edgar Wright","popularity":1.1853,"profile_path":"/dQzv5Ml2SkelS33hgl7E2oh0a9S.jpg","credit_id":"5eee032ab84cdd0036309e6f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6039,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shane Salerno","original_name":"Shane Salerno","popularity":0.259,"profile_path":"/1VcCN0nfmEItZQfGqxIJMdoi4T8.jpg","credit_id":"5eee0341134d58003828fbdf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10521200","wikidata_id":"Q2749374","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2400,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yCGBNNnqOACCFTi0EtbDdyJVwC2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6170,"name":"motherly love"},{"id":170865,"name":"child kidnapping"},{"id":193460,"name":"mother child separation"},{"id":239469,"name":"modern-day thriller"},{"id":286957,"name":"adaptation"},{"id":333185,"name":"high concept"},{"id":336380,"name":"crime thriller"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
