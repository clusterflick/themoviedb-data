He lived a normal life with his wife and children. But inside he was someone else. At the age of 57, he decided to show his true self. Åke became Ann-Christine. This is her personal story of what it is like to come out as a woman in the workplace, in the family and in society. About gender identity, own and others' prejudices and the longing to be oneself.
