Valeria, who manages the San Roman vineyard, hasn't had an easy life. Her own father, Jose Maria 'Chema' San Roman, the family's patriarch, has always hated her because she is the only one who doesn't obey him. A man without scruples, selfish and womanizing, Chema arrived to the United States, married Valeria's mom to steal everything from her and later disposed of her. If that weren't enough, Chema schemes a hideous plan causing Valeria to experience a horrible betrayal. Meanwhile, Francisco arrives to visit his father at the ranch only to learn that he has married Marcia, a woman much younger than he who leads him to the brink of bankruptcy and drives him to suicide.","popularity":0.1218,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tierra de Pasiones","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":971921,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leonardo Galavis","original_name":"Leonardo Galavis","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee94ce4dd926a00339edd50","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2321526,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Freddy Trujillo","original_name":"Freddy Trujillo","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee94d09dd926a00349edf70","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":564090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danny Gavidia","original_name":"Danny Gavidia","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee94cf6fdc1460035e4b6e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1363154,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luis Manzo","original_name":"Luis Manzo","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee94d019661fc0036597ceb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0459693","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Spanish\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"es\", \"native_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\"}","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
