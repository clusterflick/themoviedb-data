They wanted it. They overcame a 10.5-game deficit in late August and claimed a playoff berth on the final day of the regular season. They then conquered the Philadelphia Phillies and prevailed against the Milwaukee Brewers. Facing off next against the Texas Rangers, the St. Louis Cardinals fell behind 3-2 in the Fall Classic despite the unprecedented performance of Albert Pujols. But back at Busch Stadium, a Game 6 for the ages unfolded as the Redbirds, who were twice down to their last strike, rallied in both the 9th and 10th innings. Then hometown hero David Freese crushed an all-time walk-off home run in the 11th inning to force a Game 7. In the deciding game, ace Chris Carpenter's steely performance and a clutch two-run double from World Series MVP Freese delivered the franchise's 11th World Series Championship.","popularity":0.7656,"poster_path":"/fUhP7GFAlJOCxtbuUoTkDGbIqXe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11709,"logo_path":"/aJ2Y9GJNyxWWfMfOsaVXHXCHaDM.png","name":"Major League Baseball
