Wrenching first-person narratives from seven decades of women, each one facing an unplanned pregnancy -- and the dreadful decision that no one wants to make. Both pro-life and pro-choice, both out front on the picket line and inside the clinic, these women's stories turn politics into heart-searing drama: a pregnant 17-year-old and her pro-life mother whose conflict unfolds in front of the camera; a 22-year-old who became a pro-life protester when she learned that her mother nearly aborted her; an unhappy mother-of-two who's expecting a third when her marriage suddenly hits the rocks; a 71-year-old grandmother who still grieves for her mother, an early victim of illegal abortion. In this fusion of past and present, the history of abortion is the history of women -- told at a time in America when yesterday's back-alley abortions may be the only choice left for tomorrow.","popularity":0.125,"poster_path":"/eAyYXgizhbAwOaJaTx6AsErLfci.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3268,"logo_path":"/tuomPhY2UtuPTqqFnKMVHvSb724.png","name":"HBO","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abortion: Desperate Choices","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Abtreibung: Schwere Entscheidungen","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Abortion: Desperate Choices","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1028309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susan Froemke","original_name":"Susan Froemke","popularity":0.1445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c5de4ed4fe0400d3e09a99","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1028309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susan Froemke","original_name":"Susan Froemke","popularity":0.1445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c5de41c9054f008041fa6b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1028309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susan Froemke","original_name":"Susan Froemke","popularity":0.1445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c5de5be54d5d00b55fa938","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1418,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Albert Maysles","original_name":"Albert Maysles","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":"/dlel1CxK3lhhZt3inUjOpMQo8A.jpg","credit_id":"6455136e091e62010278af90","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1028309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susan Froemke","original_name":"Susan Froemke","popularity":0.1445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64551376d48cee00fceea555","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2171934,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Romeo","original_name":"John Romeo","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eebe316c5ada50031d56174","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1062371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deborah Dickson","original_name":"Deborah Dickson","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eebe2e3bd990c0034fc1c23","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1062371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deborah Dickson","original_name":"Deborah Dickson","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eebe248c5ada50031d560f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1413202,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sakae Ishikawa","original_name":"Sakae Ishikawa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eebe32bc5ada50031d5619b","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1238136,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sheila Nevins","original_name":"Sheila Nevins","popularity":0.0954,"profile_path":"/a9QK5bZlNB0zx2RTROOixTA3o5d.jpg","credit_id":"5eebe2af6dea3a0032be552e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1418,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Albert Maysles","original_name":"Albert Maysles","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":"/dlel1CxK3lhhZt3inUjOpMQo8A.jpg","credit_id":"5eebe2a3b84cdd00342be7c7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1062371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deborah Dickson","original_name":"Deborah Dickson","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eebe284c5ada50031d5610d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1418,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Albert Maysles","original_name":"Albert Maysles","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":"/dlel1CxK3lhhZt3inUjOpMQo8A.jpg","credit_id":"5eebe269bd990c0037fc24c4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2683528,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nell Archer","original_name":"Nell Archer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eebe2786dea3a0032be54f1","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1449268,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James D.
