Held at the Centro de Cine Experimental of the Universidad de Chile - one of the most prolific and enduring poles of militant cinematographic production at the time -, this experimental fiction about class relations is one of Miguel Littín's first films, which would become one of the central references of the political cinema in Latin America. Por la tierra ajena was one of many films that sought to take part in the process of raising awareness that would lead to the election of Salvador Allende in 1970.","popularity":0.0608,"poster_path":"/mRmu6XhL7hFPp4y0dLw8fwbQv5d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":150596,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cine Experimental de la Universidad de Chile","origin_country":"CL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"1965-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Por la tierra ajena","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2863772,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Patricio Manns","original_name":"Patricio Manns","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f66a9ce0ca7f00cbe6bc9f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2364300,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Fernando Bellet","original_name":"Fernando Bellet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f66a9112197e00fea97caa","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1048479,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miguel Littín","original_name":"Miguel Littín","popularity":0.1819,"profile_path":"/eExbKZ0tUnVTaRxVKO5wNLgShtX.jpg","credit_id":"64f66a7212197e0138b5d6a8","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2364300,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Fernando Bellet","original_name":"Fernando Bellet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f66a89e0ca7f012eb4b9f0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1048479,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miguel Littín","original_name":"Miguel Littín","popularity":0.1819,"profile_path":"/eExbKZ0tUnVTaRxVKO5wNLgShtX.jpg","credit_id":"5ee7ee5a3ff2df001f69835f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/mRmu6XhL7hFPp4y0dLw8fwbQv5d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Spanish\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"es\", \"native_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\"}","note":"","release_date":"1965-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
