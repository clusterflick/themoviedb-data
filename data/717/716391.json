The immigration phenomenon described in workers' hands in a factory refers to both the modernization process in the period and the unionization. Hacer emigrates to Istanbul with his father, two children and his wife. Her husband left her and she was a helpless. Hacer was influenced by the union of the working factory, who owns the crippled friends. Hacer thought very much about to traditions versus modernization. It is the last of the film of director Ömer Lütfi Akad's Bridal-Wedding-Recoup trilogy. And it is still the inaccessible film of Turkish cinema history with its movie theme, cast, and acting success.","popularity":0.3071,"poster_path":"/5pSM6wmMnT3XqQaTg0SuNocGVr6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75209,"logo_path":null,"name":"TRT","origin_country":"TR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"1975-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diyet","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Blood
