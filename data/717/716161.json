Vladislav Mamyshev-Monroe's head was \"glued\" to Lyubov Orlova's body, and now Monroe is re-acting the movie, making what was a musical about amateur artists into a tragedy – postwoman wants too much and, eventually, loses her mind. Sometime in the movie, the movie shifts to Antarctica from the Volga, where Monroe-Orlova is looking at the fascinating life of penguins.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/kj3YSs5ykuANzYdqCM7CA0TdfY6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Volga-Volga","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2680449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladislav Mamyshev-Monroe","original_name":"Владислав Мамышев-Монро","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/1ONX4CP0hKphnldDBkjUuZc59AY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dunya","credit_id":"5ee881312d531a001ff7f4bc","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1386165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrey Silvestrov","original_name":"Andrey Silvestrov","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":"/uOBhXHaxj7Uq2yYLozbtKa1CFiN.jpg","credit_id":"5ee88147fe631800209a5bba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2038466,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pavel Labazov","original_name":"Pavel Labazov","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee881652d531a0022f7f298","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2680460,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gennadiy Beliayev","original_name":"Gennadiy Beliayev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee884e02d531a001ff7f72d","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":834,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kj3YSs5ykuANzYdqCM7CA0TdfY6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":590}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Russian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Russian\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"ru\", \"native_name\"=>\"Russian\"}","note":"","release_date":"2006-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
