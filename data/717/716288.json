For Chinese pioneers who died in Canada, Victoria's Chinese Cemetery at Harling Point was a temporary resting place until their bones could be returned home. (Traditional Chinese belief says that the soul of a person who dies in a foreign place wanders lost until their bones are returned home.) This film traces the rich history of the Vancouver Island cemetery from controversy and neglect to its revival as a historic site. Told by those closest to it, the story of Harling Point is a metaphor for Canada, a country still working on making a home for all who live within its borders.","popularity":0.3713,"poster_path":"/an7mmtbSILKHHrqHkcJ0KFvnBeZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Harling Point","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laara Ong","original_name":"Laara Ong","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"63d5a9353dc31300af216e40","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3895868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Wong-Chu","original_name":"Jim Wong-Chu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":24,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63d5a9d720e6a500bc0065b1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3895870,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlayne Thornton-Joe","original_name":"Charlayne Thornton-Joe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":25,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63d5a9e122df2e00a0d96b8d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3895871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edna Chow","original_name":"Edna Chow","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":26,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63d5a9e712b10e007fdad553","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3895872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David C.Y.
