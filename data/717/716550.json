In his short film Blanche-Neige Lucie (Snow White Lucie), Huyghe tells the story of Lucie Dolene who sang in the French version of Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The film shows an aged Lucie humming the famous song while an interview with her runs as subtitles to the images. This mirroring of dubbing and translation serves as the vehicle for Huyghe's questioning of multiple identities and the ideal of translating a meaning to create a universal image.","popularity":0.0856,"poster_path":"/sYlA07TAiAcqyQPbIksLvg6nTIg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Snow White Lucie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":126387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucie Dolène","original_name":"Lucie Dolène","popularity":0.1293,"profile_path":"/eCYYmdcWZVXVfZa5UFkniRIc7fC.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"630437bedbad500091e7395d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69761,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charles de Meaux","original_name":"Charles de Meaux","popularity":0.1094,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630437a9dfe31d00920548b6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1136021,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Huyghe","original_name":"Pierre Huyghe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63043781839d93007e4d2268","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1073996,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jean-Louis Vialard","original_name":"Jean-Louis Vialard","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6304379a3009aa007d56de09","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1136021,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Huyghe","original_name":"Pierre Huyghe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eea0e31fdc1460034e59ede","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6724912","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sYlA07TAiAcqyQPbIksLvg6nTIg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":721}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
