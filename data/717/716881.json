In this documentary we follow an international team of scientists and explorers on an extraordinary mission in Mozambique to reach a forest that no human has set foot in. The team aims to collect data from the forest to help our understanding of how climate change is affecting our planet. But the forest sits atop a mountain, and to reach it, the team must first climb a sheer 100m wall of rock.","popularity":0.3921,"poster_path":"/4I3A2WBcQNtf88f5OFQv2Wcf7r9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118854,"logo_path":"/g9LPNlQFoDcHjfnvrEqFmeIaDrZ.png","name":"Rideback","origin_country":"US"},{"id":49822,"logo_path":"/3ona9SNUU97BeiP10g1Lv7kP9HM.png","name":"Grain
