Since NAFTA, 9/11 and the Obama and Trump administrations border residents have been on the front-lines of the humanitarian crisis caused by increased border enforcement build up. Undeterred is an intimate and unique portrait of how residents in a small rural community, caught in the cross-hairs of global geo-political forces, have mobilized to demand our rights and to provide aid to injured, oft times dying people funneled across a wilderness desert. The film was made by Eva Lewis, a resident of Arivaca and long time member of People Helping People in the Border Zone (PHP). Undeterred was created in close collaboration with the Arivaca community and members of PHP.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Undeterred","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2682512,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eva Lewis","original_name":"Eva Lewis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eeac0c9dd926a0033a103c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
