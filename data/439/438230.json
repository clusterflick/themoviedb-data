Joined by their friends Joan Jonas and Peter Campus, Holt and Smithson improvise a conversation based on opposing - and stereotypical - positions of East Coast and West Coast art of the late 1960s. Holt assumes the role of an intellectual conceptual artist from New York, while Smithson plays the laid back Californian driven by feelings and instinct. Their deadpan exchange ironically lays bare the limitations and contradictions of both sides in the debate.","popularity":0.0481,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"East Coast, West Coast","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1175499,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Smithson","original_name":"Robert Smithson","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/5HXvpztPmEWUIeCkLOtCKWIivvw.jpg","credit_id":"588fbf7f92514101a900cd4a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1175498,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nancy Holt","original_name":"Nancy Holt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/u66CVS1qziRPDvL1gkdzZO3ljd3.jpg","credit_id":"588fbf87925141019d00ce3e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
