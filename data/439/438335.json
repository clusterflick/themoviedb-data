The corpses of the two masked Malian women were discovered ritually mutilated and hanging from a ceiling. The detectives' search leads them to a Malian father and his 18-year-old daughter. The father confesses to the crime, but further investigation reveals that he is lying. Even more puzzled than before, the two investigators consult a noted professor who tries to help them understand the true nature of the crime. The story is based on a book by controversial French academic Tobie Nathan, a self-proclaimed \"ethno-psychiatrist,\" who has been researching the problems experienced by France's many immigrants, particularly African ones, as they wrestle with the clash between their native beliefs and their new culture.","popularity":0.3592,"poster_path":"/bTVwqheLNqJB25aHB2a5wEUwj1r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16670,"logo_path":null,"name":"SNC","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1115,"logo_path":"/ntH7T5gsN6wtyrfHGHJDTuneQ7o.png","name":"M6 Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":8799,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alicéléo","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1997-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Saraka Bo","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Bohringer","original_name":"Richard Bohringer","popularity":0.3499,"profile_path":"/v6372ku0d2Y28zUJ7mGrwaNQ04g.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Commissioner Diamond","credit_id":"58908ff0c3a368701d005da7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yvan Attal","original_name":"Yvan Attal","popularity":0.9982,"profile_path":"/2VaxsiFuad8uHHWTM6Fc71wtNCx.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Taïeb","credit_id":"58908ff9c3a368701d005dac","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thierry Hancisse","original_name":"Thierry Hancisse","popularity":0.2005,"profile_path":"/u2jwlcR4vcGK8mnrAMk0dGvLTsM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Simon","credit_id":"627f1ac72dc9dc009eedf543","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1485052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Roussel","original_name":"Anne Roussel","popularity":0.106,"profile_path":"/gD9yJnZ5X8rF5dvSmf9AdDGqFxU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Véronique","credit_id":"627f1ace5aadc41363b045d5","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1207803,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Denis Amar","original_name":"Denis Amar","popularity":0.1645,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58908fdf92514103fa005c2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0120067","wikidata_id":"Q28000851","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.745,"height":1023,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bTVwqheLNqJB25aHB2a5wEUwj1r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":762}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
