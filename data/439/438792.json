After seeing a documentary about Portuguese neurologist Egas Moniz while low on sleep, Jorge, a Chilean filmmaker living in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, suddenly remembers visiting a statue of Moniz in a park somewhere in Santiago with his father—who also happens to be a neurosurgeon. Jorge goes on a lengthy exploration of the city of his birth and all the way to Patagonia looking for the statue, all the while pondering memories of his dad and the imaginary territories between his homeland and New York.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":86085,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cine Portable","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2015-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Monument Hunter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","title":"El rastreador de estatuas","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1563658,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jerónimo Rodríguez","original_name":"Jerónimo Rodríguez","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5893446a9251416ee5006427","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1563658,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jerónimo Rodríguez","original_name":"Jerónimo Rodríguez","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61bd91ea09ed8f00407bfab3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1563658,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jerónimo Rodríguez","original_name":"Jerónimo Rodríguez","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61bd91f6105611001cc87b33","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3351067,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jorge Aguilar","original_name":"Jorge Aguilar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61bd92111f331900418ae222","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1563658,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jerónimo Rodríguez","original_name":"Jerónimo Rodríguez","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"589344649251416ef20063b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6201454","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
