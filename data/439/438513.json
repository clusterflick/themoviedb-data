The film features two lovers who have never met in person but whose poetry over three years has subtly declared their unyielding love. Yam's minimalist acting style enables her to convey dynamic passion as well as step about the stage with ease and accomplish the image of a resolute, yet gentle, scholar. Pak meanwhile defies a prime minister with pride and dignity.","popularity":0.1184,"poster_path":"/qarIe05n1zrpdIYTRy2KNl3qEwq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92021,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bo Ying","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1959-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Butterfly and Red Pear","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Butterfly and Red Pear Blossom","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1698169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yam Kim-Fai","original_name":"Yam Kim-Fai","popularity":0.0855,"profile_path":"/afACe8IeEqD7RCeAJx1ejHhsvBY.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Chiu Yue Chow","credit_id":"589117ebc3a36838ff000c8b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1698061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pak Suet-Sin","original_name":"Pak Suet-Sin","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/liAkTFLX7RzkrKDiMa1ayK9NmvX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Che Siu Chau","credit_id":"589117f6c3a368701000bb5d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119626,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leung Sing Poh","original_name":"Leung Sing Poh","popularity":0.1337,"profile_path":"/y3ASIyOIl7G3nbIRR7poGjZzvtq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lau Gung Chai","credit_id":"5891180492514103f000bee7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":119625,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liang Tsi-Pak","original_name":"Liang Tsi-Pak","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Wong Fu","credit_id":"61fea8e1fe5c9100b42ab64a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1698103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cheung Sing-Fei","original_name":"Cheung Sing-Fei","popularity":0.0558,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Leung Si-Shing","credit_id":"61fea8f0025764001f8a5d82","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158502,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Tit","original_name":"Lee Tit","popularity":0.1476,"profile_path":"/jJ3e5nCfJH6ZF9yihwTkur8bAv9.jpg","credit_id":"6142e38caaf897008c0d5589","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1619348,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Suen Lun","original_name":"Suen Lun","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636780330d2f53009199f2e5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1640629,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Leung Chi-Hing","original_name":"Leung Chi-Hing","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6367803c9d6e33008adbb22f","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1698787,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Lai Chu","original_name":"Lai Chu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63678046350398007d218d95","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":119640,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Tse Tsak-Yuen","original_name":"Tse Tsak-Yuen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6367804fcaaca2007a084d0c","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119641,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tong Tik-Sang","original_name":"唐滌生","popularity":0.1478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fea8c9bc8657004379836f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0205010","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1240,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/qarIe05n1zrpdIYTRy2KNl3qEwq.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":826}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"1959-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
