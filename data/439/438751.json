In the tiny Italian mountain village of Daone, a group of grandmothers led by the straight-talking Erminia begin planning a trip in honour of their Rododendro club’s 20th anniversary. They quickly agree on a trip to the sea, where many of their members have never ventured. But how will they raise enough money so that everyone can wiggle their toes in the surf? They sell pies and sweets and even boldly pose for a calendar but when this doesn’t get them the money they need, they have one last idea and it is this one that sends them viral, making them famous across Italy.","popularity":0.1098,"poster_path":"/j1UXUqjoN5fyLajsg2LFYY3Tn1O.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54222,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jump
