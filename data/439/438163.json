Another 37 years passed before that record was broken by Mark McGwire. Five days after McGwire's feat, Sammy Sosa broke the brand new record. And the race was on! Fans watched breathlessly as the record passed between the two men and time left in the season dwindled. Relive it all, from Ruth, to Maris, to the final days of the 1998 Sosa/McGwire slug-fest.","popularity":0.7246,"poster_path":"/mqsE5GlT16QWirt3KmuBoAghqS1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11709,"logo_path":"/aJ2Y9GJNyxWWfMfOsaVXHXCHaDM.png","name":"Major League Baseball Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Race for the Record","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41247,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Len Cariou","original_name":"Len Cariou","popularity":0.766,"profile_path":"/9VJeCcxHkPkN4xH4izmwYHXRMy2.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"588f676e92514101ad009763","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1217274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark McGwire","original_name":"Mark McGwire","popularity":0.0855,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"588f66f0c3a36860b30086d3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1242518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sammy Sosa","original_name":"Sammy Sosa","popularity":0.0782,"profile_path":"/8r2aGivJaoKiHNZOdXomEwve2iV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"588f673ac3a36860ac00914b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1249456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Maris","original_name":"Roger Maris","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/vKHZ3TU4ND6tNeOshKYAPtTh9V6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"588f6750c3a36860b300870e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88960,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Babe Ruth","original_name":"Babe Ruth","popularity":0.1156,"profile_path":"/fdbzzwlIneXrtxMyz27VKLkOhn6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"588f675dc3a36860b8009038","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1747668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Buck","original_name":"Jack Buck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"588f677f925141019a009951","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1214267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Griffey Jr.","original_name":"Ken Griffey Jr.","popularity":0.1236,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5cba4625925141066ef4b2b2","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2158932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Cone","original_name":"David Cone","popularity":0.1187,"profile_path":"/8b5hwdYvKINxfJbZTcn1845iCm7.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5cba4633925141097df488ae","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":160042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Costas","original_name":"Bob Costas","popularity":0.5564,"profile_path":"/icnJnhC0voFGH9QaIiWQf5MhL5N.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5eca04aceb79c2001ea38480","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1830411,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jeff Scott","original_name":"Jeff Scott","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eca04bc140bad45ee15af0e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2651431,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jon Clateman","original_name":"Jon Clateman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eca04c7e635710020d084ee","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2651432,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stuart Kirshenbaum","original_name":"Stuart Kirshenbaum","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eca04dc0fb17f001d80283e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2651433,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Heather Mitchell","original_name":"Heather Mitchell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eca04e6e635710021ce6af8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0267867","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":778,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mqsE5GlT16QWirt3KmuBoAghqS1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":518}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1480,"name":"baseball"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
