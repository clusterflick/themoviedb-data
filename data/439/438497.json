The Three Evils brutally beat and cripple Auyeung to intercept his scheme to appropriate the tripods but fail to prevent him from shoving two of them down into the deep valleys in frustration. Finding themselves no match for the Three Devils, the fellowship seek help from Lau Piu-piu. But the master declines out of a grudge against Suen Bik-ling with whom she was locked in a bitter love triangle which resulted in disfigurement of her face. Undaunted, they embark on a perilous journey in quest of the tongue of a mythical dragon and eyes of a crimson python for her cure.","popularity":0.5141,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1964-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Buddha's Palm Part 4","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Tso Tat-Wah","original_name":"曹達華","popularity":0.7112,"profile_path":"/4gzcAQywNFgidUJ9DXcuelMIAo.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lung Kim-fei","credit_id":"5891134192514103ec00bccd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1698071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yu So-Chau","original_name":"Yu So-Chau","popularity":0.0803,"profile_path":"/movIeNpMS0oUF4dpyCankhw0Xqt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Kau Yuk-wah","credit_id":"5891134f92514103f000bba7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ling Yun","original_name":"Ling Yun","popularity":0.8161,"profile_path":"/gfngrH6TwFruZVvl19MXqIgs0GK.jpg","credit_id":"58911330c3a368700d00b667","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"","release_date":"1964-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
