For one, it is unclear where the rehearsal ends and the performance begins. Everson's close-ups offer a distinctly cinematic rendering of theatrical blocking, with the actors' repeated movements (a soldierâ€™s salute, a woman's carrying a lit torch) taking on heightened significance. The plot remains obscure but Everson conjures a psychological intensity comparable to Maya Deren's studies for camera. - Max Goldberg","popularity":0.3079,"poster_path":"/7SjN1NkOeskfEBNcG5OKYAthY3c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"House in the North Country","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Jerome Everson","original_name":"Kevin Jerome Everson","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/73HkNiQo15TBV7SysKt6ajFBbG6.jpg","credit_id":"5893ae2cc3a36831e0000d4e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7SjN1NkOeskfEBNcG5OKYAthY3c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"},{"id":33477,"name":"shore"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
