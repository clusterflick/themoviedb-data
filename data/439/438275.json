In 1755, English colonial officials forcibly expel close to 10,000 French-speaking Acadians from their lands in Nova Scotia, lands that have been in Acadian hands for almost 150 years. What follows is the epic story of a group of people played as pawns in a struggle between two empires. It is a saga of death and dislocation that reverberates to this day - an event unparalleled in the history of the colonizing on North America. Drawing from the highly acclaimed series, Canada: A People's History, this one-hour documentary examines the events leading up to the brutal expulsion. Through dramatic re-enactments and interviews with Acadian descendants, it brings to life a human tragedy, one that changed the course of history and established a legacy and culture that lives on to this day.","popularity":0.0614,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Expulsion: The Story of Acadia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":105716,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Starowicz","original_name":"Mark Starowicz","popularity":0.1308,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5a8cf0ffc3a3684c63001f8d","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
