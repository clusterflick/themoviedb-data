The team is led by the experienced duo of Helen and Demetri, joined by grad students Zander and Hermione. The team is seen by Omaka, a native Hawaiian kahuna, and his mischievous aide, Puka. Sensing Helen's yearning for passion from Demetri, Puka doses the man with the nectar of a special flower from the forest -- but he has dosed Zander instead, triggering confusion and hilarity. When Puka tries to make amends by dosing Demetri too, and later Tanya as well, the results are surprising and wonderfully zany. Love wins the day.","popularity":0.9732,"poster_path":"/dL8UCtCowoZACPrPL1ngzxX9gfE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6679,"logo_path":"/r3r7qbHKgo8N0yr7r1TjLmzLXfQ.png","name":"MarVista Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":7274,"logo_path":"/3eczK5vkLcskBQ8dv4yDChhYPJI.png","name":"Island Film Group","origin_country":"US"},{"id":185718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rock Solid Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Midsummer's Hawaiian Dream","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Sogno di un amore di mezza estate","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"Sonho de Uma Noite de Verão...
