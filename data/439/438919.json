Later some more boxes of his negatives turned up at a country house sale. I printed them and made enlargements from some of them, and a few years later the idea came to me to use them in a film.  'In Grandfather's Footsteps the film-maker re-evokes the presence of her great-grandfather, Henry Stiles Savory, a Victorian clergyman, photographer and scientist. It's not a costume drama, bringing in his writings, and his personal effects - books, machines, photographs - Anne Rees-Mogg emphasizes her own links with him and his preoccupations. She achieves a real sense of timelessness.' - Jo Comino","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/p0sHhzU6ubg0eZuY3nLtCKMqavk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grandfather's Footsteps","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1467034,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne Rees-Mogg","original_name":"Anne Rees-Mogg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/ntWjEopJjdzOw8J2P977yuN8vyG.jpg","credit_id":"5893b968c3a3685621000784","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i2qnM5tje5V3lkJlnMpT7LuqCyB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/p0sHhzU6ubg0eZuY3nLtCKMqavk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
