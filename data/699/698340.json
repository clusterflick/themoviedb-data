The sunrise performance kicked off at 4am GMT, with the city cloaked in grey clouds as the band whisked through each new track. For their performance of “Arabesque”, they were joined by Stromae, Femi Kuti, and a pack of sparkling horns.","popularity":0.5459,"poster_path":"/alXjQ2YFF1b7O724DbGqiREghcd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":153283,"logo_path":null,"name":"JA Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Watch the band's first performance of the Sunrise part of their new album \"Everyday Life\" at sunrise in Jordan.","title":"Coldplay: Live in Jordan (Sunrise Performance)","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Martin","original_name":"Chris Martin","popularity":0.685,"profile_path":"/LK6ptUtgzijpcTGwCCXXC5cBpu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ea922fb5a4690001c072056","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Champion","original_name":"Will Champion","popularity":0.2032,"profile_path":"/zlIXAjhg884Xx5cnnJk4DOuISt7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ea92309945d36001e84bb50","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy Berryman","original_name":"Guy Berryman","popularity":0.231,"profile_path":"/yj7mbD66phm5u3ODsEo02WJQVVx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5ea92318945d36002084ad06","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Buckland","original_name":"Jon Buckland","popularity":0.1911,"profile_path":"/vrBNUEH06BGkQ9bihe2VRJUj4Mz.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5ea92809cc96830023afb281","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":572551,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Dugdale","original_name":"Paul Dugdale","popularity":0.2137,"profile_path":"/bWM0X1OMVml3FhDph4EGcs3QtHC.jpg","credit_id":"61f34f5117792c001b95c857","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1882379,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Simon Fisher","original_name":"Simon Fisher","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f34f5c3009aa009f8779f5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":544867,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julie Jakobek","original_name":"Julie Jakobek","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f34f7bac8e6b006f2da26f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3401692,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bean Taylor","original_name":"Bean Taylor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f34f8d10923000420cb746","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3401693,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wendy Ponting","original_name":"Wendy Ponting","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f34f98c392660021839c7a","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5zlCh0TBSeXDFMWGFMaeDjRxljd.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cPrJWez8nLHGgskUKmcsTPPtBp4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cTP09pUkoUWFV7Kg0GQkdBH1bBq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/alXjQ2YFF1b7O724DbGqiREghcd.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/u8FXPhNIkjBnhgtaEBgQpmeMFU9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
