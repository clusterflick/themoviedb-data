Men are falling into line, two abreast, every man with his tin cup and dish. Command is given 'forward march' and the column approaches the audience. A fine looking body of men, worthy of a people battling for freedom. Figures are life size and life like. Prominently displayed upon their military hats is the emblem Cuba Libre, a single star in a red tri-colored field. An accurate and interesting subject.","popularity":0.0686,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":18758,"logo_path":"/fe3cMUJLhbkTM9PDxdDA8hQpAxp.png","name":"Edison Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1898-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cuban Volunteers Marching for Rations","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1173772,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William C.
