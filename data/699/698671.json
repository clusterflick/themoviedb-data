Sketches are hung on clotheslines to dry. The red paint drips from the drawings like fresh blood. An inscription on the wall: 'Tabaski, who's next?'. Three characters and a sheep revolve around him and reconnect him with reality. This hybrid movie, blending fiction, performance and history, is freely inspired by the painter Iba Ndiaye (1928- 2008) and his work entitled 'Tabaski'. 'Painting is remembering', he said.","popularity":0.0637,"poster_path":"/znzeNUIPzDU4MUGmCmznET3n3C9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"SN","name":"Senegal"}],"release_date":"2019-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Wolof","iso_639_1":"wo","name":"Wolof"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tabaski","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2636851,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurence Attali","original_name":"Laurence Attali","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebbc918a294f000200bc44b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2636851,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurence Attali","original_name":"Laurence Attali","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebbc922c3514c001e5ec9b3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10271914","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fu2g9MmANfFOBioIhaXkKmq8j6k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1022,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/znzeNUIPzDU4MUGmCmznET3n3C9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":682}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
