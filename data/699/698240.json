Shadowed by a pair of bizarre strangers, he embarks on a dangerous journey of sordid self-exploration – seemingly without consequences. Saunders believes he can get away with anything during occasional 15-minute periods of time that he is convinced aren’t real; but his marriage, work, friendships, and sanity all spiral out of control as he sinks ever deeper into the snare of his own misdeeds. Ultimately, Saunders finds himself questioning everything – including who he has become – as he is forced to face the Truth with one final, life-or-death decision.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"What would you do if you knew t­he next fifteen minutes didn't count?","title":"Every Hidden Thing","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1341717","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
