The project develops from a number of previous projects Byrne has realised, each of which similarly engage a collective amnesia about our shifting cultural history, through dramatic re-enactments of culturally loaded conversations and interviews gleaned from discarded popular magazines. With Homme à Femmes (Michel Debrane) Byrne focuses on a generically candid encounter with Sartre, which discusses his relationship with women throughout his life, at a moment towards the end of that life.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/fo7kcmxLQJfmX8r3DJ82bG8GyVO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hommes a Femmes (Michel Debrane)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2619425,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gerard Byrne","original_name":"Gerard Byrne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eaa53accc9683001cb0add7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1634,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fo7kcmxLQJfmX8r3DJ82bG8GyVO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1090}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
