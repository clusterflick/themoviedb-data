Women across the country, outraged by inequality and prejudice are beginning to rise up and demand change. In York, a revolution is about to take place as an ordinary Heworth housewife risks her life and her family to join the fight. And she's not alone.  Across the city, women run safe-houses, organise meetings, smash windows and fire-bomb pillar boxes. It's dangerous, it's exhilarating, it's ground-breaking: and in 2017 the amazing story of York's suffragettes will be told for the first time.  Everything is Possible is York Theatre Royal and Pilot Theatre's latest large-scale community production. The play was performed on a spectacular scale with a cast of around 150 and a choir of 80.  The performance started outdoors before moving onto the stage at York Theatre Royal. We raised the purple, green and white flags and cried \"Votes for Women!\" to sold-out audiences.","popularity":0.6847,"poster_path":"/nAys9uKy0H9oJFNYORKifQ4606S.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":133055,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pilot Theatre","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"We raised the purple, green and white flags and cried \"Votes for Women!\"","title":"Everything is Possible: The York Suffragettes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":203459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Marten","original_name":"Barbara Marten","popularity":0.4998,"profile_path":"/sZiDuphaHkKzcmSCdpG5lsp0N6t.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Annie Seymour Pearson","credit_id":"62ba57a38b959e005263a788","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3604391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beth Sitek","original_name":"Beth Sitek","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mabel","credit_id":"62ba5889f031740d0e2dc825","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3604399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annabel Lee","original_name":"Annabel Lee","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Lilian Lenton","credit_id":"62ba59f2e1faed141f386619","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3604401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Loretta Smith","original_name":"Loretta Smith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Leonora Cohen","credit_id":"62ba5a7a2e2b2c031cec1bb7","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2620055,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juliet Forster","original_name":"Juliet Forster","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eab15cb2d1e4000248622dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2620054,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bridget Foreman","original_name":"Bridget Foreman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eab15a9b7fbbd001b3bb015","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2620056,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katie Posner","original_name":"Katie Posner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eab15d8d861af001e7b7ba8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2620058,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Prema Mehta","original_name":"Prema Mehta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eab15f22d1e40001d860f75","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":821,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nAys9uKy0H9oJFNYORKifQ4606S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":583}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2383,"name":"feminism"},{"id":6090,"name":"equality"},{"id":11718,"name":"feminist"},{"id":34214,"name":"gender"},{"id":34221,"name":"gender roles"},{"id":190969,"name":"women's suffrage"},{"id":214831,"name":"suffragettes"},{"id":233514,"name":"feminist activism"},{"id":235671,"name":"gender equality"},{"id":254372,"name":"voter suppression"},{"id":257510,"name":"suffragist movement"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2017-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Everything Is Possible: The York Suffragettes Trailer","key":"9hAA40ByrhU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-06-23T10:42:42.000Z","id":"5eab2479b7fbbd001d3bbb9b"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Everything is Possible: The York Suffragettes","key":"jNbu3SndroY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2017-06-14T17:10:39.000Z","id":"5eab248e945d360020865777"}]}}}
