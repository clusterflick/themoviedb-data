As he follows a string of clues to uncover his identity, he discovers he’s been living two different lives: one as a super-successful crime kingpin, surrounded by beautiful women, expensive toys, and a lavish lifestyle; and the other as an undercover CIA agent, but with a puny salary, no family or home life whatsoever, and zero trappings of success. There's just one problem: He can’t remember which of these two personas is his true identity.","popularity":1.0972,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":121470,"logo_path":"/hYURmkObkMOBj5KO7L1i5TdXS2a.png","name":"87North Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":122771,"logo_path":"/bYRqVEAuaC1QWmt3hGo0PMdK7EX.png","name":"Westbrook","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Fast and Loose","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2888,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Smith","original_name":"Will Smith","popularity":7.3708,"profile_path":"/1QqaRZ8neYlqLx7ODZC4as47wUV.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"601e268215c636003fbc6657","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40684,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Leitch","original_name":"David Leitch","popularity":1.0874,"profile_path":"/by8W1oRzWtapDRZIfpedAkkXY51.jpg","credit_id":"5ea8e4a85a4690002306e5a8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112947,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Erich Hoeber","original_name":"Erich Hoeber","popularity":0.4121,"profile_path":"/iIV4kJKeaOth7n7iYVMOl2DQ3lw.jpg","credit_id":"5ea8e4dbcc9683001eafa0c3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112948,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jon Hoeber","original_name":"Jon Hoeber","popularity":0.2244,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea8e4d0b7fbbd001b39e45e","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1030590,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kelly McCormick","original_name":"Kelly McCormick","popularity":0.3527,"profile_path":"/vg6wi9jYG1rZsdm1nvJii4aO1xy.jpg","credit_id":"5ea8e4bab7fbbd001c39d312","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2888,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Smith","original_name":"Will Smith","popularity":7.3708,"profile_path":"/1QqaRZ8neYlqLx7ODZC4as47wUV.jpg","credit_id":"601e26cb0929f6003ea8d238","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114410,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jon Mone","original_name":"Jon Mone","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601e26dfc1606a0040c4986e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46080,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"James Lassiter","original_name":"James Lassiter","popularity":0.2897,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601e26f590cf51003d19b6e3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":865,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Bay","original_name":"Michael Bay","popularity":3.8515,"profile_path":"/rkC7lei20x5xlFH4SivAXXBh6uR.jpg","credit_id":"67077d06200b5388b556114a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1986351,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chris Bremner","original_name":"Chris Bremner","popularity":0.3629,"profile_path":"/jkJXXw4dkvk4HBHa89ypggZtNuF.jpg","credit_id":"67077d1d200b5388b556117c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":579281,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eric Pearson","original_name":"Eric Pearson","popularity":0.5521,"profile_path":"/S2ZAnKX48e4yGZ8nb8f0f6fuTw.jpg","credit_id":"67077d28d0616c7b19fb3cf6","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3709726,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ryan Shimazaki","original_name":"Ryan Shimazaki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67077d3f6718012fc2339b81","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3063978,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Noah Fogelson","original_name":"Noah Fogelson","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67077d4ac92c2e56d8613bb0","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1155665,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Annie Marter","original_name":"Annie Marter","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":"/irJpE0wnYKdnpEwlbyRl5iqU6gL.jpg","credit_id":"67077d56e46a12a1941a086a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29015,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert Simonds","original_name":"Robert Simonds","popularity":0.3358,"profile_path":"/xJt4rTl8AMgJ8nihNN6DarCOSB9.jpg","credit_id":"67077d63e46a12a1941a086e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10122,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Barry H.
