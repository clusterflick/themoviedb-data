He also takes on the role of soloist in Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 26 – a work of sparkling beauty and nuanced expression. There are also four famous works by Maurice Ravel, which create an impressive synthesis of elegance and originality. The final highlight is the Boléro, perhaps the most stunning crescendo in music history.","popularity":0.1159,"poster_path":"/AmyZ6WBv3gIQdB1qhqBmqjFqLdA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"New Year's Eve Concert 2018 - Berlin Philharmonic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Barenboim","original_name":"Daniel Barenboim","popularity":0.1008,"profile_path":"/pNoHzRlu3vNQmQsB7XrmrFYjOd1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5eab0920426ae800264b7388","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2897270,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Berliner Philharmoniker","original_name":"Berliner Philharmoniker","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ff5499e08cf87003fb38006","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uGjna7sWUiVzBwMzLWEwGcJaJdj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vnjPM8XYYCR6PzbUnD7le7CGnZK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1085,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qMn2EM1s6rlJuFASaBrb53luVjq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":724},{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/AmyZ6WBv3gIQdB1qhqBmqjFqLdA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1047}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
