Through individual stories, they describe their childhoods, family backgrounds, life at school, and how they spent their free time. The stories complement each other and are intertwined; we see emotions and hear things that reveal the horrific DNA of domestic violence. The documentary addresses the issue of abuse with an emphasis on the entire social environment of the victims and the societal underpinnings. Typical of domestic violence is that victims often hide it within themselves; they do not talk about it, and sometimes they do not even admit it. But in the documentary, they were determined to speak out.","popularity":0.1642,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2022-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Love Turns to Hatred 4 - Domestic Violence on Children","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":927787,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vít Karas","original_name":"Vít Karas","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63653d6522af3e007eaf2117","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2422977,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Petr Kozák","original_name":"Petr Kozák","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6367bb8696e30b007d08b34d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2432579,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jan Kluka","original_name":"Jan Kluka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6367bb971684f7007a9b478b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2512664,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jan Strnad","original_name":"Jan Strnad","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6367bb7e66565a007a44f3b9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2315886,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kateřina Kovářová","original_name":"Kateřina Kovářová","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6367bb6ce7c0970091339ac1","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1622977,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vladimír Nahodil","original_name":"Vladimír Nahodil","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6367bb8e350398007d21a1b2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":516,"name":"child abuse"},{"id":10303,"name":"domestic abuse"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ji.hlava International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2022-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ČT2","release_date":"2022-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
