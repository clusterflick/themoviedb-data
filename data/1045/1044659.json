Meet the homeless, citizens just like you and me, who lost their jobs and homes and try to rebuild their lives from a backpack, rolling cart and a tent. Are they all drunks? Druggies? Lazy? Worthless? 'Searching For Safe Ground' challenges the stereotypes as homeless people unite in community to fight for their human right to shelter themselves when there homes are gone.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/yENTw7PEGYrSRvCjjjrdb7AbYRm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Searching for Safe Ground","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3044890","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yENTw7PEGYrSRvCjjjrdb7AbYRm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
