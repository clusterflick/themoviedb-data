At 82, Eric is still at work in his studio making books and creating art. As he methodically layers a tissue paper collage of the caterpillar, he describes the feeling he achieves working in his studio, the sense of being at peace, all alone, when everything grows quiet and it is just himself and his work. The film taps into that deep creative need in each of us, a spirit that started in Eric as a very young child and is unceasing today.","popularity":0.2265,"poster_path":"/thV1I75MplJtjbMlU1vaWtleyBN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eric Carle, Picture Writer: The Art of the Picture Book","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1470650,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eric Carle","original_name":"Eric Carle","popularity":0.1153,"profile_path":"/beMBcxEILrs2h8rqRRkffHlu5iP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"636467cd9d6e33007a59228e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3769720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Carle","original_name":"Barbara Carle","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"63646e239653f6007af4f72d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3312713,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kate Geis","original_name":"Kate Geis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636468001e6489007d354be1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3769704,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kate Geis","original_name":"Kate Geis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63646822a0f1a20082d03c07","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3497396,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Motoko Inoue","original_name":"Motoko Inoue","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63646834d8d329007fb1b928","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3312715,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kate Geis","original_name":"Kate Geis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6364684d5437f5007f2f4ae8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498847,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kate Geis","original_name":"Kate Geis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63646891902012007e230fa8","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3769708,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wes Talbot","original_name":"Wes Talbot","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636468a82e06970090241094","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1721607,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"George Langford","original_name":"George Langford","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636468c17f1d83007c94ae15","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3769711,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Robert Mowen","original_name":"Robert Mowen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636468e5d7107e007b2fd3ea","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Opening/Ending Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1315302,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rikk Desgres","original_name":"Rikk Desgres","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636468fe1e6489007a335a3d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1338167,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andy Turrett","original_name":"Andy Turrett","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63646911336e01007a473422","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3769713,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Fortier","original_name":"John Fortier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6364692be61e6d007e062599","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3497396,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Motoko Inoue","original_name":"Motoko Inoue","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636469419653f6007af4f42e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1108493,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alex Rappoport","original_name":"Alex Rappoport","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6455084c87a27a00fe733b53","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2076842","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/thV1I75MplJtjbMlU1vaWtleyBN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":526}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2679,"name":"artist"},{"id":2936,"name":"artists' life"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":157955,"name":"childhood"},{"id":170173,"name":"children's book"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
