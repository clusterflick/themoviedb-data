He sat by the edge of a lake and asked the universe to send him a “story worth telling”. Two month later, he was admitted to Bellevue Hospital, while searching for Ani DiFranco. Was this a vision quest? A mental health issue? Was this all an elaborate art project?  For twenty years Keith Wasserman has made and delivered elaborate art mail packages - all in the hopes of befriending his muse. Dear Ani explores what can happen when you present your truest self, and risk total failure. It is an intimate account of psychotic mania, personal mastery, and creative triumph.","popularity":0.1032,"poster_path":"/qEES7HNdZazFWAG5CsfnNjyB6vx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":196693,"logo_path":null,"name":"Movie Magic Media Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dear Ani","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1538969,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Micah Levin","original_name":"Micah Levin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63647c79902012007948323a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2383647,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Micah Levin","original_name":"Micah Levin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6423663d414291010534213d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1012009,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Benjamin Eckstein","original_name":"Benjamin Eckstein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6423664fb2e07400b658e08b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3228193,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Keith Wasserman","original_name":"Keith Wasserman","popularity":0.1513,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64236644b2e07400778f3d6c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3983926,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jason Jordan","original_name":"Jason Jordan","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6423669541429100e2503dd8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1538969,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Micah Levin","original_name":"Micah Levin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642366360443c900e223809e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1538969,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Micah Levin","original_name":"Micah Levin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642366554142910128819ef3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3228193,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Keith Wasserman","original_name":"Keith Wasserman","popularity":0.1513,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6423666e5907de009a5bc0da","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3983926,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jason Jordan","original_name":"Jason Jordan","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6423669cce5d8200f498c391","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":117444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ani DiFranco","original_name":"Ani DiFranco","popularity":0.1077,"profile_path":"/w0JjgRP6J6dqTHkdRXmhMuAhE8T.jpg","credit_id":"642366680443c90128a7282f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ge7RklOplfrvUXRd6HpfrVXXLfp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1282}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qEES7HNdZazFWAG5CsfnNjyB6vx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Hot Docs 2023 Trailer: DEAR ANI","key":"8IXBd3rujJM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-03-28T15:44:19.000Z","id":"6423652872c13e0488ff0f49"}]}}}
