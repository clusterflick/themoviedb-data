A young person, Eileen, decided to leave the hectic hustle and bustle of modern life to live there and dedicate their life to hard work. During the day, they repair the crumbling houses in the town, at night they sleep in their trailer. They meet many locals and travelers with whom they share both their joys and doubts. The longitudinal documentary works as a double portrait: a portrait of a person defying societyâ€™s ideas and a portrait of a place living in the past, full of idiosyncratic figures and fascinating life stories.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/uNluDlVHJz1xvwrdmY6gAzbDFys.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cisco Kid","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3273240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emily Kaye Allen","original_name":"Emily Kaye Allen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6364d2c49653f6007d9d7e2d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23031726","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1SqSY8oJPOyjer5DjUntb4UsTgf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":2475,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uNluDlVHJz1xvwrdmY6gAzbDFys.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ji.hlava International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2022-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Slamdance Film Festival","release_date":"2023-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Fandor","release_date":"2024-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Official Trailer","key":"c-b3LX4Ucqw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2023-12-21T20:47:46.000Z","id":"6584bad375f1ad098a6dc80e"}]}}}
