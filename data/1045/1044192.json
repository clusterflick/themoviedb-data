When the Czech government was looking for reasons not to take in a few dozen children from Greek refugee camps after the chemical attacks on Syrian civilians in 2018, Miko took justice into his own hands and, together with the Czechs Helping initiative, prepared facilities for child refugees. However, government officials gave priority to political interests. Will parliamentary elections and a change of ministries save the situation? An unflattering but accurately portrayal of the Czech Republic as a country that will only offer a helping hand when it is worthwhile.","popularity":0.2825,"poster_path":"/cTxcY5iHTQZWAurZZmAFx6SFM94.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2023-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Citizen Miko","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1648213,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Kvapil","original_name":"Robin Kvapil","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6364df68d8d329007a4f8490","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2431817,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martina Štruncová","original_name":"Martina Štruncová","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636d11b0d7fbda00905cc9f9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1485013,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Josef Krajbich","original_name":"Josef Krajbich","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636d11c2d7fbda007beea4a1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1648213,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Kvapil","original_name":"Robin Kvapil","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636d11dc0499f2009b47f189","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1648213,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Kvapil","original_name":"Robin Kvapil","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636d11e40499f200a6625c9d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1300924,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bohdan Bláhovec","original_name":"Bohdan Bláhovec","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636d11f281383100b510d899","department":"Crew","job":"Dramaturgy"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2489105,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Martin Blauber","original_name":"Martin Blauber","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636d120581383100b510d8a9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2219034,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jiří Gráf","original_name":"Jiří Gráf","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636d121181383100dd35c7c5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2294104,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Miroslav Chaloupka","original_name":"Miroslav Chaloupka","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636d121c21621b00b49dd10b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26934897","wikidata_id":"Q113362683","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mK8JxuccpcdxmtqAzLoohx85rQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"cs","file_path":"/cTxcY5iHTQZWAurZZmAFx6SFM94.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1448}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":258407,"name":"romani people"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ji.hlava International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2022-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"12+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
