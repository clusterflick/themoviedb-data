Kuboš conducts interviews with his contemporaries, including Jaroslav Vojtek, Peter Kerekes, and Zuzana Piussi, which he intersperses with their work, while at the same time placing both in a broader cultural and political history. A playfulness and respect for documentary film as such shines through the film.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/f49UB2N1In01YQAIiitwibbrqde.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"+-90","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2284845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marek Kuboš","original_name":"Marek Kuboš","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6364f6b09653f6007af52701","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23032810","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2682,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f49UB2N1In01YQAIiitwibbrqde.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1788}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
