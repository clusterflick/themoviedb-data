The story also reflects the turning point after the Velvet Revolution, when Dana Němcová briefly entered politics as an active member of the Federal Assembly, or when, in response to the war in the former Yugoslavia, she founded a counselling center for refugees and refugee women in the Czech Republic. In the film, she also meets some of those she helped again after many years.","popularity":0.2071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2022-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eternal Smile of Dana Němcová","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2279533,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivana Pauerová","original_name":"Ivana Pauerová","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63653a0931d09b007ae57d1c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2318656,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michal Janoušek","original_name":"Michal Janoušek","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6367b04fc048a90079576d79","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1558691,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"David Cysař","original_name":"David Cysař","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6367b0311684f7007f78812f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1380935,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hedvika Hansalová","original_name":"Hedvika Hansalová","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6367b03ae7c097007df8691a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2279533,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivana Pauerová","original_name":"Ivana Pauerová","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6367b02896e30b007d08aff1","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2318657,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Petr Šoltys","original_name":"Petr Šoltys","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6367b057651fcf00833293d8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2283103,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ivan Horák","original_name":"Ivan Horák","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6367b0451684f7008aeb19a6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ji.hlava International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2022-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
