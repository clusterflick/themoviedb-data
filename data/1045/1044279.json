Without market distribution, supplies dwindle, and the truth of human nature is revealed when the thin veil of order as we know it is stripped away in the absence of authority. Two young brothers find themselves orphaned in a world where the rules of society are superseded by the need to survive. Forced from their home, 14-year-old Luke must protect his young brother from looters, gangs, hunger, and 1,200 miles of wilderness which stand between them and safety. Luke and Scott face heartbreaking decisions and ethical questions as they struggle to find the will to keep each other going.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/3onZ9uGfdNHiH4tboJRod7juX9y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Collapse","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4571615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Hall","original_name":"Thomas Hall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mike","credit_id":"65e565ca278d8a0185c2c08a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4571618,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katie Jones","original_name":"Katie Jones","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Ashley","credit_id":"65e56600006b010186a29214","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4571620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron McCormick","original_name":"Aaron McCormick","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Luke","credit_id":"65e5660e1ad93b01860941f6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4571622,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kale McCormick","original_name":"Kale McCormick","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Scott","credit_id":"65e566189979d2017cb423ef","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4571612,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dave McCormick","original_name":"Dave McCormick","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e5658da672540185ad2065","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4571623,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mac McCormick","original_name":"Mac McCormick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e5663a9979d20163b11ea3","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4571612,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dave McCormick","original_name":"Dave McCormick","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e5662cfe077a018512d815","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4571612,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dave McCormick","original_name":"Dave McCormick","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e565ad006b010186a29163","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4571627,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thomas McCormick","original_name":"Thomas McCormick","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e5666220e6a50186547eb4","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4571612,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dave McCormick","original_name":"Dave McCormick","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e56597a672540185ad209c","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4571628,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Frank Ross","original_name":"Frank Ross","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e56680278d8a0185c2c2a5","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4571629,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Brad Warren","original_name":"Brad Warren","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e566b7006b010186a293ff","department":"Crew","job":"Special Effects"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3179218","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1602,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3onZ9uGfdNHiH4tboJRod7juX9y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1201}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
