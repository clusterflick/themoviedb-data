Niles played an important part in the national “discovery” of Appalachian folk music. He describes how he travelled with the photographer Doris Ulmann through the 1920s and 30s — she taking pictures of the people, and he learning their songs. The film shows Niles in concert, at home, at work arranging his music, and explaining the historical place of balladry in American music.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/s4NZWEhOLHWmKvazOjjSxkXjhM0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108939,"logo_path":null,"name":"Appalshop","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Jacob Niles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3772592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Jacob Niles","original_name":"John Jacob Niles","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"636736e4d8d329007fb28da4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3772590,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William B.
