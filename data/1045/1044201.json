F. Burian, the film Chceme žít (We Want to Live, 1949) is probably his worst. The intention to create a powerful work of cinema that would combine modern means of expression with the ideological canons of socialist realism failed completely. Ježek and Tarnovski discovered these „shambles“ and tried to rebuild a structure out of the hopelessness and futility of life. Ježek has photochemically “transcribed” selected passages with the greatest possible degree of humility towards the work of the great avant-gardist, Tarnovski similarly makes the soundtrack visible. The improvised encounter of sound and image in dialogic mode can lead to various misunderstandings resulting in ambiguous compromise.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2022-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Want to Die","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3770041,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaroslav Tarnovski","original_name":"Jaroslav Tarnovski","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6364e3579653f6009140f9ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2695084,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Ježek","original_name":"Martin Ježek","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6364e34e2ac499007e7f2ad5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3770041,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaroslav Tarnovski","original_name":"Jaroslav Tarnovski","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6367a194d8d329007fb2abe8","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mHEOSopg9V1YP859APuCU6TBOEY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ji.hlava International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2022-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
