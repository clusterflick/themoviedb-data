He dreams of a career as a cellist, but has a  job as a supply clerk at a bookstore. He is trying to get over an unhappy love affair and feels  lonely. When he falls in love with a new girl and things don't work out, Bruno blows his top. He  attempts suicide, but is eventually saved. Although the film treats the theme of suicide attempts by  young people, it is first and foremost about how difficult it is to handle emotions such as love,  solitude, disappointment and friendship... It's about the search for one's own place in a metropolis.","popularity":0.175,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Before the Night","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","title":"Voor de nacht","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Avant la nuit","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1130187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabrice Boutique","original_name":"Fabrice Boutique","popularity":0.0654,"profile_path":"/ibtuMW5BPIk1IkadgOs1SHVgyIa.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Metallo","credit_id":"6366508766565a008ac123ed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1357333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hilde Heijnen","original_name":"Hilde Heijnen","popularity":0.2384,"profile_path":"/7RGfZO8AV14FvasDRVoBkZVSUXA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jodie Foster","credit_id":"636650975437f500823bee45","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1123354,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kadija Leclère","original_name":"Kadija Leclère","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Daphne","credit_id":"636650a7d8d329007fb24f57","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":143513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Circé Lethem","original_name":"Circé Lethem","popularity":0.0949,"profile_path":"/2w2QzCOjv5nWQ50UhBZUxwTXQjF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Anja","credit_id":"636650b222af3e0079d71c6b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1414465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dimitri Leue","original_name":"Dimitri Leue","popularity":0.0782,"profile_path":"/a6hs0KDfiSlUR914fF3mKQBFQIb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bruno","credit_id":"636650c41684f7008aeaaffd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3771430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clara van den Broek","original_name":"Clara van den Broek","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Zus Anja","credit_id":"636650d3651fcf008d75fe77","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1929609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benjamin Verdonck","original_name":"Benjamin Verdonck","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Rudi","credit_id":"636650dfbd588b00908297d0","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2459410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manno Lanssens","original_name":"Manno Lanssens","popularity":0.0895,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636650f2e004a600815cb4cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76257,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Glynn Speeckaert","original_name":"Glynn Speeckaert","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636650fe5437f500823bee5f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51482,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Philippe Ravoet","original_name":"Philippe Ravoet","popularity":0.0948,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636651090d2f53007acdb9da","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0234999","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
