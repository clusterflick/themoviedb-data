Agnes is leaving Gael, her long-term boyfriend, suddenly, and without explanation. Told through a series of vignettes, Ricochet is about the tricks of time, perceptions of love and memory's persistent invasion of reality. Ricochet is inspired by Luis Bunuel's biography My Last Breath, and features a riveting central performance from award-winning Australian actor Daniel Henshall (Snowtown). Sometimes life can only be understood backward. Unfortunately it has to be lived forward.","popularity":0.3746,"poster_path":"/w0wqZ9dqDwIYovktxIcOiaY8HP1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ricochet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1961708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adele
