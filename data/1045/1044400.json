Shell's actions in Nigeria have led to resistance for many years, including among the local population, but there are also groups in the Netherlands that oppose Shell's activities in Nigeria. For example, this year after a 13-year trial, the company was ordered to pay damages to a group of Nigerian farmers, an unprecedented legal precedent. In this documentary of VICE's long-running series Toxic, we tell the story of this lawsuit through the eyes of human rights lawyer Channa Samkalden.
