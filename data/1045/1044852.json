Bill Haley and His Comets were the leaders of this short-lived musical movement. By 1962 Rock-A-Billy was all but gone. But in present day London the fashions, attitudes, tattoos and music of the Rock-A-Billy era are alive and well; if you know where to find it. In venues like The Tennessee Rock and Roll Club, Teddy Boy society still perpetuates the mores of Rock-A-Billy culture. Visually arresting in its approach, The Teddy Boys of the Edwardian Drape Society offers a glimpse into this little known world of late night London.","popularity":0.1026,"poster_path":"/o61QUkZJ1PV0EuxofbAoiDHAVJT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Teddy Boys of the Edwardian Drape Society","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118180,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Weber","original_name":"Bruce Weber","popularity":0.0995,"profile_path":"/sb1muVdFIOj6PlCOJLAjMVIO4Xp.jpg","credit_id":"6366efb89653f6007d9e1f89","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2784941,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nan Bush","original_name":"Nan Bush","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63676fb79653f6007af5e572","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3767885,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Phyllis Famiglietti","original_name":"Phyllis Famiglietti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63676fd51684f7007f786f97","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1781,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lance Acord","original_name":"Lance Acord","popularity":0.1341,"profile_path":"/d6GFg2GBKDlIlhJdKopjSQg09oe.jpg","credit_id":"63676fc61684f7007a9b2ca6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1598,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o61QUkZJ1PV0EuxofbAoiDHAVJT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1066}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
