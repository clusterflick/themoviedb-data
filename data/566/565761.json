Rather than go quietly to tend roses in a garden, Hubbard begins a series of violent actions not unlike those described in tabloids, and this is heightened by inter cutting tabloid headlines between scenes. Throughout, there are occasional shots of a television critic who watches this very play as it unfolds, and he writes a negative review filled with cleverly phrased but bitter invective.","popularity":0.6442,"poster_path":"/8R6EkgFCBlfa7Bt2cVyvytnOjap.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14063,"logo_path":"/b7od4dXpqSHIYQx5ykwjnzfKiNv.png","name":"Granada Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1971-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paper Roses","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86105,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Maynard","original_name":"Bill Maynard","popularity":0.2152,"profile_path":"/uU4i1l0jozXzXolhHkUoparSrM7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Clarence Hubbard","credit_id":"628cd8af1a32483b630d9a14","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":192889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Gee","original_name":"Donald Gee","popularity":0.14,"profile_path":"/c4C7MI3XwCH8I5zZmdgbfUKrTpM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"John Chart","credit_id":"628cd8bcdf86a800505d38b1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":186272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aimée Delamain","original_name":"Aimée Delamain","popularity":0.1607,"profile_path":"/brsWTYLhNEKw4iSj7GrU51fQ4dy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mrs Hubbard","credit_id":"628cd8d9df86a800a6ff38fd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Carson","original_name":"John Carson","popularity":0.2918,"profile_path":"/e52q1zeQsq1hqr2EB1U0M1rRyh4.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Joe","credit_id":"628cd8e30b73160050c88973","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dudley Jones","original_name":"Dudley Jones","popularity":0.1453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"The Critic","credit_id":"628cd8f1d3d387005279c2e2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":601407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Desmond Perry","original_name":"Desmond Perry","popularity":0.09,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Harold Bladdy","credit_id":"628cd9071a32483b630d9ab8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":198560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Gladwin","original_name":"Joe Gladwin","popularity":0.228,"profile_path":"/8ArI5KZfK4tLWMSRooud0s8in4f.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Messenger","credit_id":"628cd9107d5db51b2aa76993","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":568131,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kenith Trodd","original_name":"Kenith Trodd","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":"/n71WZXrULWvS3Q2lswxfImKtYsr.jpg","credit_id":"628cd952323eba005090bfeb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":152007,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barry Davis","original_name":"Barry Davis","popularity":0.069,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628cd929209f1812c49da6bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54349,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dennis Potter","original_name":"Dennis Potter","popularity":0.3684,"profile_path":"/oiymzgh2XvUZVNjqIarbBW1il06.jpg","credit_id":"628cd9381a32483b630d9b4a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3504530,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Alan Price","original_name":"Alan Price","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628cd983323eba00a65d75df","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1434791,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ray Goode","original_name":"Ray Goode","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628cd9600b73160050c88b41","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2704959,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Don Kelly","original_name":"Don Kelly","popularity":0.1145,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628cd96e7d5db51b29208a50","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0067552","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.763,"height":1412,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8R6EkgFCBlfa7Bt2cVyvytnOjap.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1078}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1971-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
