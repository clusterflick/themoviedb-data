Photographing the world's largest mountain in the world's largest film format demanded more than just strength and courage; it required dedication and purpose. During shooting, our filming schedule took an unexpected turn when eight climbers from other expeditions died in a sudden storm high on the mountain. Safe from the disaster, our film team helped launch a rescue.  Re-live the events of those dramatic days which captured the world's attention, and hear about our team's heroic ascent of EVEREST to photograph the first large format film images from the top of the world.  Summit day was heartfelt, especially for our climbing leader, Jamling Norgay, whose father is a Sherpa climbing legend. A devout Buddhist, Jamling deeply respects the mountain and its deities. The tragedy and triumph of Jamling's team reminds us of the importance and presence of spirit, not just on the mountain, but everywhere and always.","popularity":0.5187,"poster_path":"/23M8SXRI9PbeIEbJkN2QY9EOOXE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2753,"logo_path":"/zlL22wCmcblgNo68WyFu6nYghKT.png","name":"MacGillivray Freeman Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"On Location in the Death Zone","title":"The Making of Everest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Greg MacGillivray","original_name":"Greg MacGillivray","popularity":0.1134,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c00871a0e0a26486a0270c5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Greg MacGillivray","original_name":"Greg MacGillivray","popularity":0.1134,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c00872b0e0a262cfb06581a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1031809,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Brad Ohlund","original_name":"Brad Ohlund","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c0086f89251417e55017a0a","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0410285","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1812,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/23M8SXRI9PbeIEbJkN2QY9EOOXE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1208}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9817,"name":"behind the scenes"},{"id":159212,"name":"mountain climbing"},{"id":192779,"name":"mount everest"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
