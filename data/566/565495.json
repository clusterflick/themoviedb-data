This is the story of one of them, an attack on Berlin, probably the most heavily defended target of them all and one which made terrible demands on the courage of the aircrew.  On the long, cold and desperately dangerous missions over Northern Germany and back to a difficult landing in wintry England, thousands of men died or suffered ghastly injuries. One must imagine that they were terrified much of the time, but there is very little sign of doubt or anxiety on the brave faces in Iliffe Cozens' film.  Although certain scenes had to be re-created for technical reasons, the raid is a real one and there are no actors.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2004-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night Bombers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Nightbombers","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2185546,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henry Illife Cozens","original_name":"Henry Illife Cozens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c004a91c3a36869ae064f66","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2185546,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henry Illife Cozens","original_name":"Henry Illife Cozens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c004aa3c3a3685a4b0605e9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2185546,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henry Illife Cozens","original_name":"Henry Illife Cozens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c004a97c3a3685a4b0605d3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2185546,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henry Illife Cozens","original_name":"Henry Illife Cozens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c004a9c925141111605d59f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3752994","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"DVD","release_date":"2009-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"VHS","release_date":"2004-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
