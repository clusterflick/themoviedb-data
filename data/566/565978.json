We begin to see how the two of them find it hard to connect with each other as they lack an understanding of what it’s like growing up in their respective countries and the culture clash between the father’s eastern heritage and his son’s western identity. Slowly Channu has to learn about Nikhil's world and begin to accept the loss of some of the traditions that Nikhil struggles to identify with.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Closed Doors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2186814,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Beth Atkins","original_name":"Beth Atkins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c02af3e0e0a26360e09afae","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2186810,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Binstead","original_name":"Harry Binstead","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c02ae529251417e2e042f0c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2186812,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robby Khayer","original_name":"Robby Khayer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c02af2f0e0a265b2809f692","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2186811,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Amman Kayla","original_name":"Amman Kayla","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c02ae879251410b92090dd5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2186816,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacob Robbins","original_name":"Jacob Robbins","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c02af6c0e0a26360e09b026","department":"Directing","job":"Script Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2306998,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Matt Gibbons","original_name":"Matt Gibbons","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd1838b0e0a2627aa02fe6d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2306999,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Harry Barrell","original_name":"Harry Barrell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd1839d9251410b62263ca5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2306997,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Penny Eastbury","original_name":"Penny Eastbury","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd1836a0e0a26225a0323a9","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"Closed-Doors-318645698971329","instagram_id":"@closeddoorsfilm","twitter_id":"@closeddoorsfilm"},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
