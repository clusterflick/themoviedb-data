Sarah and Aaron are related, but their live paths have diverged a long time ago. While still solving their personal problems, they have to work together to fulfill the last wish of their Jewish grandmother, who got into a concentration camp aged 15 and has miraculously survived the Holocaust. They have to somehow find the remains of her favorite childhood pet â€“ a dog that could dance on her hind legs, but is long dead and is buried somewhere in Poland. This is a well-formed film that refuses to employ sentimentality just for show.","popularity":0.2104,"poster_path":"/jTcMZbwy7IWvZ1ifw1xHKONU8TV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":69128,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ezeqial Productions","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2018-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dancing Dogs of Dombrova","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2856200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katherine Fogler","original_name":"Katherine Fogler","popularity":0.1536,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5fafeb636dc6c0003f29d169","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1223535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Douglas Nyback","original_name":"Douglas Nyback","popularity":0.1929,"profile_path":"/7HW030fNzz4hTIffMLGppfc8XyT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5fafeb68e24e3a0040e5f63d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2803035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doroftei Anis","original_name":"Doroftei Anis","popularity":0.1469,"profile_path":"/oMBYx7rvRPapuGcsWKikDNaDkvG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5fafeb6e4a4bfc0042b4c1b1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2856204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Silva Helena Schmidt","original_name":"Silva Helena Schmidt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5fafeb85ec4552003ff64509","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2856205,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefan Vizireanu","original_name":"Stefan Vizireanu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5fafeb8dc15f89003f830866","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1163332,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zack Bernbaum","original_name":"Zack Bernbaum","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fafeb9c3a48c5003c7cf39d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1163332,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zack Bernbaum","original_name":"Zack Bernbaum","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fafeba1e24e3a0040e5f65e","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2856207,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Whatling","original_name":"Michael Whatling","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fafebaba22d3e0041032876","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6739214","wikidata_id":"Q118629559","facebook_id":"dancingdogsfilm","instagram_id":"dancingdogsmovie","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lrzLkPpOPjqZDBSydChOr61npIn.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":808,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mxlQw7TnU2rbbNGZXI8OYOpHjDg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1438}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jTcMZbwy7IWvZ1ifw1xHKONU8TV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"18A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow Jewish Film Festival","release_date":"2020-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Austin Film Festival","release_date":"2018-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Dancing Dogs of Dombrova (2018) | Trailer | Katherine Fogler | Douglas Nyback | Doroftei Anis","key":"RBGDMlcop2o","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2020-09-22T21:23:03.000Z","id":"5fafec2eb54002004159127f"}]}}}
