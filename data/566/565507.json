I spent several days in the North, under the snow, listening to these people talk candidly about what they had lived through, telling their own stories without the media as an intermediary. Their testimonies were terrifying, harsh and sad, but at the same time touching, sincere and human. From the pictures and interviews that I collected, I decided to make a film, not to reflect how awful the events were, but to communicate the singular and even surreal nature of each person’s experience. My intention wasn’t so much to focus on this particular event in Japan, but rather to make these stories more universal as a way of paying tribute to all the victims of natural disasters throughout the world.","popularity":0.0701,"poster_path":"/9b1aMXERGRlyf8c4p3bOiEEnDRy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7128,"logo_path":"/6eLVLIUh5jhqinKGjaGZ9kl1SmU.png","name":"Ecce Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2013-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arekara - The Life After","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2185600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kôichi Nakazato","original_name":"Kôichi Nakazato","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5c005f7ec3a36865bc06c442","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2185601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shigetsugu Gotô","original_name":"Shigetsugu Gotô","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5c005f840e0a26360e06b989","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2185602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sumiko Abe","original_name":"Sumiko Abe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5c005f8b0e0a26360e06b994","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2185603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yûji Ishimori","original_name":"Yûji Ishimori","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5c005f92c3a368647607cc0f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2185604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hiroko Utsumi","original_name":"Hiroko Utsumi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5c005f9ec3a36861f907121a","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1181352,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Momoko Seto","original_name":"Momoko Seto","popularity":0.0782,"profile_path":"/c81W972EmmRo1mFBaFCMwmysJnM.jpg","credit_id":"5c005ef892514169ad062fc9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1876579,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Quentin Degy","original_name":"Quentin Degy","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c005f12c3a36861f9071069","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1181352,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Momoko Seto","original_name":"Momoko Seto","popularity":0.0782,"profile_path":"/c81W972EmmRo1mFBaFCMwmysJnM.jpg","credit_id":"5c005eee0e0a26486a024237","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1181352,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Momoko Seto","original_name":"Momoko Seto","popularity":0.0782,"profile_path":"/c81W972EmmRo1mFBaFCMwmysJnM.jpg","credit_id":"5c005f000e0a26360e06b8fe","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":67036,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nicolas Sarkissian","original_name":"Nicolas Sarkissian","popularity":0.0814,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c005f0b9251417e2e014fc1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9b1aMXERGRlyf8c4p3bOiEEnDRy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
