Beauty and hardness of pristine nature, human impact, coexistence with nature, conflict with predators, hard labor of honey bees – all of it seen from the perspective of inhabitants of the jara (a traditional Georgian hive) that is placed out there in the middle of a forest. Film features local beekeepers, their traditions and daily work, herdsmen and bears, pictures of country life, all of it on the backdrop of amazing landscapes of Adjarian Mountains. The quest for survival and prosperity of both humans and animals builds the dramatic arch of the film. Stylistically film is created in form of a fairy tale.","popularity":0.0533,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jara","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2186024,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Helen Bradburry","original_name":"Helen Bradburry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c014fec0e0a262cfb072ef1","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2186025,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Giorgi Vatsadze","original_name":"Giorgi Vatsadze","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c014ffc925141165407b77c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2186026,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Elene Asatiani","original_name":"Elene Asatiani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c01500a9251410b920745c3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2186027,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Arshia Samsaminia","original_name":"Arshia Samsaminia","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c01501cc3a36861f9082e8f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2186023,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nika Tsiklauri","original_name":"Nika Tsiklauri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c014fd8c3a36865dc065aeb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ka","note":"","release_date":"2017-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
