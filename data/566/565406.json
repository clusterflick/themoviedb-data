Alberts. When he moors at an island with a house on it that used to be the executed dictator Ceausescu's country cottage, reality and imagination converge at this remarkable place. The occupant is disturbed by the unwanted guest. When it gets dark, he disappears into the house. He is watched through the slightly open door. In the end, he sits down to dinner and it turns out the table has been set for three. The invisible third person is the host's imaginary lover. Loneliness and booze prevail. When the traveller's delirium is at its height, the swamp becomes the dominant factor.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Swamp","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1414420,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jan Wouter van Reijen","original_name":"Jan Wouter van Reijen","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bffc84e0e0a2633a605ab80","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2185323,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"BarBara Hanlo","original_name":"BarBara Hanlo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bffc8650e0a265b2805dad5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2185323,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"BarBara Hanlo","original_name":"BarBara Hanlo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bffc8229251417e2e0080fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2185323,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"BarBara Hanlo","original_name":"BarBara Hanlo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bffc839925141108005bd3f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":582355,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Frank van der Weij","original_name":"Frank van der Weij","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bffc85ac3a368647606d729","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2185323,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"BarBara Hanlo","original_name":"BarBara Hanlo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bffc8430e0a26360e05d308","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7720954","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
