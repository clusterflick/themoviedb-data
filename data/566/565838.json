Matagoro killed Gendayu, the little brother of Mataemon's brother in law, Watanabe Kazuma. Becoming a murderer out of jealousy for a childhood friend, Matagoro fled in another domain, using friends of his father and his lineage linked to Tokugawa Ieyasu. It was somehow a complicated matter, as it seems at that time, a law from Toyotomi Hideyoshi allowed a little brother taking revenge for his elder brother, but not the reverse. After some years, the lord of Kazuma and Mataemon found a way, and they were allowed to take revenge for the murder. They fought and killed Matagoro and just one other samurai who was helping the culprit. It seems at that time, Kazuma was Mataemon's only assistant.","popularity":0.5134,"poster_path":"/5c381UsIbpJ5SRmzC8fIHKlieig.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1935-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Araki Mataemon: Master Swordsman","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Kensei Araki Mataemon","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2186458,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jusaburô Ichikawa","original_name":"Jusaburô Ichikawa","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c01f0160e0a2629ce083bc6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2186459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saemon Kataoka","original_name":"Saemon Kataoka","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c01f01ec3a36861f9092b75","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mitsusaburō Ramon","original_name":"羅門光三郎","popularity":0.2394,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5c01f0290e0a26486a046e08","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2186460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kyoko Sakurai","original_name":"Kyoko Sakurai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5c01f036c3a36865bc08cdda","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2186461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kuwaisuke Shiba","original_name":"Kuwaisuke Shiba","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5c01f0440e0a262cfb0819fd","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2186456,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kiyohiko Itama","original_name":"Kiyohiko Itama","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c01f002c3a36869ae087d3c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2025031,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kumahiko Nishina","original_name":"仁科熊彦","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c01eff40e0a26486a046dad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0491012","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5c381UsIbpJ5SRmzC8fIHKlieig.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1462,"name":"samurai"},{"id":10491,"name":"swordsman"},{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1935-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
