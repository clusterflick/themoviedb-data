Now a passionate dancer and ambitious high school student, Ilse hopes to go to college and one day visit the family she left behind. However, her undocumented status pushes these dreams further out of reach. Halfway through her senior year, Ilse learns her DACA permit qualifies her for a special document that allows her to return to Mexico. Through a life-changing trip, Ilse reconnects with her family and Mexican roots – and her legal re-entry to the U.S. fast-tracks her application process for permanent residency. Six months after she graduates from high school, Ilse obtains her green card – mere weeks before Donald Trump takes office. While Ilse’s mother rejoices in these unexpected events for her daughter, her own fate grows ever more uncertain.","popularity":0.0658,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ilse","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2186129,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katherine Nagasawa","original_name":"Katherine Nagasawa","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c0166879251417e2e026b1a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2186128,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leah Varjacques","original_name":"Leah Varjacques","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c016674925141108007a423","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1900,"name":"immigration"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Chicago Latino Film Festival","release_date":"2017-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
