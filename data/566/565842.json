The three inventive, interconnected \"para-fictions\" that make up the trilogy deal with \"Quantum Humans\": immortal, cyborg-like entities who use dance as a ritual to transcend the oppression of technology. Using vintage means to craft each mid-length film, the Vancouver-born artist creates a fascinating work about the relationship between the individual and the collective.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/bps3u2w6grX2M3aUhAmcRctYTCk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quantification Trilogy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1437787,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeremy Shaw","original_name":"Jeremy Shaw","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/upYZEdyV21VC66RFEYcAldLaZg3.jpg","credit_id":"5c51da1ac3a36847899742b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9536748","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.562,"height":1722,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bps3u2w6grX2M3aUhAmcRctYTCk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":968}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDb","release_date":"2018-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
