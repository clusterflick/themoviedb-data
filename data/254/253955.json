The killer is caught in a moral downhill spiral with his ruthlessness increasing with every crime he commits. Meanwhile, the mother and children of the family he is living with are trapped by their conditions but refuse to give in to them. The characters seem like fragmented reflections of Iraq as it negotiates its traumas of wars and corruption, and a very uncertain future.","popularity":0.0413,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":19807,"logo_path":null,"name":"Directorate for Cinema and Theater","origin_country":""},{"id":19808,"logo_path":null,"name":"Enlil Film Production","origin_country":""},{"id":19809,"logo_path":null,"name":"Die BASISberlin Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IQ","name":"Iraq"}],"release_date":"2010-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quarantine","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1289845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asaad Abdul Majeed","original_name":"Asaad Abdul Majeed","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Hitman","credit_id":"52fe4e9c9251416c911379e7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1289846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alaa Najem","original_name":"Alaa Najem","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Kerima","credit_id":"52fe4e9c9251416c911379eb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1289847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hattam Auda","original_name":"Hattam Auda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Salih","credit_id":"52fe4e9c9251416c911379ef","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1289848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hayder Munather","original_name":"Hayder Munather","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Taleb","credit_id":"52fe4e9c9251416c911379f3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1289849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rawan Abdullah","original_name":"Rawan Abdullah","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Meriam","credit_id":"52fe4e9c9251416c911379f7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1289850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sajad Ali","original_name":"Sajad Ali","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Muhanad","credit_id":"52fe4e9c9251416c911379fb","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1289843,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Salwan Kamil","original_name":"Salwan Kamil","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e9c9251416c911379dd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1289844,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ismail Ali","original_name":"Ismail Ali","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e9c9251416c911379e3","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1289840,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dureed Al-Khafaji","original_name":"Dureed Al-Khafaji","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e9c9251416c911379d1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1289838,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oday Rasheed","original_name":"Oday Rasheed","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/xyDFXoH77PhInczcDEaQACuT1FE.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e9c9251416c911379c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1289838,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oday Rasheed","original_name":"Oday Rasheed","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/xyDFXoH77PhInczcDEaQACuT1FE.jpg","credit_id":"530ee896925141734a0005a2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1289842,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Osama Rasheed","original_name":"Osama Rasheed","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"530ee8dd9251417355000517","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1782516","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
