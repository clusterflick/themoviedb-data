Thousands of Hollywood hopefuls lineup around the block to be selected to strike a deal with Satan himself in order to achieve the unattainable stardom they so desperately seek. The turnout yields not only dedicated actors and musicians who can't get a break, but a legion of seemingly successful people willing to sign in blood not to attain immortality or world peace - but for material things like money, houses, cars and diamonds or even lesser things like a gun you never have to re-load. Ultimately, Kai Blackwood, an aspiring rock star is chosen and embarks on a nefarious path of real-life occult practices following the instructions laid out in the ancient book 'Le Grande Grimoire' and proceeds to LITERALLY sell his soul to the Devil.","popularity":0.3179,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Warning: Do Not Try This At Home","title":"I Sold My Soul to Satan","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":583839,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kai Blackwood","original_name":"Kai Blackwood","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4e6d9251416c91131329","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jymie Darling","original_name":"Jymie Darling","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e6d9251416c9113132d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Father Mike","original_name":"Father Mike","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e6d9251416c91131331","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1288526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maja d'Aoust","original_name":"Maja d'Aoust","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":"/dg5h6gtir82faVJgTQuqkHis4WV.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e6d9251416c91131335","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1288527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patti Negri","original_name":"Patti Negri","popularity":0.1052,"profile_path":"/rzEPEIndIPPyvkshX9r3mASqv7L.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e6d9251416c91131339","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288528,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Gaz","original_name":"David Gaz","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e6d9251416c9113133f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Vazart","original_name":"Alex Vazart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e6d9251416c91131345","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1509241","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10138,"name":"satan"},{"id":9377,"name":"faust"},{"id":11044,"name":"soul selling"},{"id":187477,"name":"ancient manuscript"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
