The bitter separation of his parents is not something Thomas understands, nor does he understand his own dysfunctional behaviour as a silent cry for help. As a digital native city boy, Thomas’s encounter with the natural world, and his gradual understanding of the pivotal connection he provides for his, ultimately, lonely parents, leads to realisation and discovery. There are things his parents don’t know about each other that only he can reveal. Perhaps  he has the power and the means to change everything.","popularity":0.158,"poster_path":"/efdnkNYjs6mUDVyJriL3pKTznbi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Raven on the Jetty","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3343799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Connor O'Hara","original_name":"Connor O'Hara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Thomas","credit_id":"61b4ad407d5f4b0062498559","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3343801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Fraser","original_name":"Anne Fraser","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Grandmother","credit_id":"61b4ad4d4cd9120098354c1d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3343802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Lees","original_name":"Anne Lees","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Woman","credit_id":"61b4ad58d14443004136c917","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3343803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rob O'Hara","original_name":"Rob O'Hara","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Father","credit_id":"61b4ad651f331900611c65cd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3343804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Teasdale","original_name":"Helen Teasdale","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"61b4ad711c632900410a1b35","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288394,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erik Knudsen","original_name":"Erik Knudsen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e679251416c91130875","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288394,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erik Knudsen","original_name":"Erik Knudsen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b4ad069d893900403dd9ab","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288394,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erik Knudsen","original_name":"Erik Knudsen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b4ad11ec455200602a771f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3157540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janet Knudsen","original_name":"Janet Knudsen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b4ad1e223e2000633df48a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1763550,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Duggan","original_name":"Mark Duggan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/ire2fkfYOSA24sxR80gCbvKMwTq.jpg","credit_id":"6798ef901be116409c237915","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288394,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erik Knudsen","original_name":"Erik Knudsen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6798ef9b7d96d896542383c4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1763550,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Duggan","original_name":"Mark Duggan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/ire2fkfYOSA24sxR80gCbvKMwTq.jpg","credit_id":"6798efbda6e41283f12b6d01","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3164944","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bBS4Mo2iieYXvhYMocY3CQm4Rt8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jwAQ3pOjIiDAdY2WKAw1MtLZKR6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1763,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/efdnkNYjs6mUDVyJriL3pKTznbi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1175}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Netflix","release_date":"2021-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
