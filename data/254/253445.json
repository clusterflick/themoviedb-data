As a music genre, black metal often has a strong ideological aspect. Satanic values, glorification of evil and unsolidarity, as well as pure hatred towards Christian and multicultural society, are more than just childish rebellion for the people involved.  Eternal Flame of Gehenna examines the phenomena through interviewing the key figures of the moment. It gives a face to a subculture seen as a threat to common safety by Finnish Security Intelligence.  In this movie, one will find out about the thoughts of a grave violator, grave robber, and hear what they feel when an old wooden church is burning down. Eternal Flame of Gehenna is also a view on the history and the current state of Finnish black metal, featuring bands like Azaghal, Azazel, Barathrum, Beherit, Enochian Crescent, Goatmoon, Horna, Satanic Warmaster etc.","popularity":0.0718,"poster_path":"/gDNJRs8APVUPspkh9UJBdVBT6RF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2011-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eternal Flame of Gehenna","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2347656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lord Satanachia","original_name":"Lord Satanachia","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d129bd00e0a267dceca1c39","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2347658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Molestor Kadotus","original_name":"Molestor Kadotus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d129c6c0e0a2637c2cc99aa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2347661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marko Laiho","original_name":"Marko Laiho","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d129d260e0a2602a1d33fc7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2347666,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Satanic Tyrant Werwolf","original_name":"Satanic Tyrant Werwolf","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d129e810e0a261e56ccb816","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2347667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shatraug","original_name":"Shatraug","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d129ec3c3a3681ab6222b30","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2347671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Demonos Sova","original_name":"Demonos Sova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d129f95c3a3681ab6222cd1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2347674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikko Aspa","original_name":"Mikko Aspa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d12a011c3a3685730203235","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2347675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"BlackGoat","original_name":"BlackGoat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d12a05f925141076abaf254","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2347680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaosbringer","original_name":"Kaosbringer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d12a18d0e0a261e56ccbf57","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2347681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Spellgoth","original_name":"Spellgoth","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d12a2af9251417873b9bb92","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1578934,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sami Kettunen","original_name":"Sami Kettunen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56c472e1c3a368720700252f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1578934,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sami Kettunen","original_name":"Sami Kettunen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56c472ecc3a36871fd002252","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3479540","wikidata_id":"Q18693362","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hfTXUywejbpZFyWBZVZ3s5wJVxD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"fi","file_path":"/gDNJRs8APVUPspkh9UJBdVBT6RF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1420,"iso_639_1":"fi","file_path":"/aAjOJ6RUlosd5LY7xewq26yJqiw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":163080,"name":"finland"},{"id":206966,"name":"black metal"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB (Night Visions)","release_date":"2011-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Loputon Gehennan Liekki - Trailer","key":"RWzlSeGR5bU","published_at":"2011-10-14T14:26:10.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"56c47329c3a36871f40021e3"}]}}}
