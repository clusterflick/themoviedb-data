Her career as a virtuoso seems to be over until Professor Christansen offers her a transplant of two new hands. What he omits to tell her is that the two hands in question belonged to a woman who murdered her own children. When unexplained incidents happen, followed by a murder in Roxana's entourage, she starts to wonder whether her new hands may be committing crimes of which she's unaware. Police Capitain Almeida, in charge of the investigation, falls in love with Roxana, but she remains the prime suspect. Is it possible that Roxana's hands are urging Roxana to do terrible things she's not even conscious of? Or is she the victim of some terrible plot?","popularity":0.3438,"poster_path":"/n10ArbmvBnNINHcpjSSfsZRPSlR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2013-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roxana's
