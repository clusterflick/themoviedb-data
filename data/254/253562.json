Now, for over 20 years they have rocked us with their De La songs full of inscrutable samplings, whimsically irreverent lyrics, social commentary, light rhythm and laid back rhymes. They have gained respect within and outside the hip hop community with their contributions to rap, as well as jazz, funk, soul and alternative genres. Not only are their musical innovations acclaimed and respected worldwide, but they paved a path for many alternative rap groups to come after them.","popularity":0.2381,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"De La Soul & Rhythm All Stars: Montreux Jazz Festival 2010","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":898,"name":"hip-hop"},{"id":11634,"name":"live performance"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"R","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
