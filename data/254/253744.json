To cash in on his rise to stardom, it was re-edited to feature more of him. Various shots were repeated several times; long shots were blown up into close-ups and inter-cut with other footage; some scenes were projected on a loop, so that Rudolph Valentino repeated the same motions several times over; one scene was used as a flashback; and out-takes from the original were inserted into the new film. In addition, the locale of the new picture was switched from World War 1 Germany to a desert island by the simple expedient of inserting shots of bathing beauties on a palm-fringed beach throughout the film.","popularity":0.3848,"poster_path":"/hD8M5gJhtPOyjUiAs40YCHOkqek.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1920-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Isle of Love","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"An Adventuress","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Over the Rhine","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1289480,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julian Eltinge","original_name":"Julian Eltinge","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/gWmvuG2tp6XbZRjRmltRgLQZSV9.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Clifford Townsend / Julie","credit_id":"52fe4e8e9251416c91135b9d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1263246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederick Ko Vert","original_name":"Frederick Ko Vert","popularity":0.044,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Lyn Brook","credit_id":"52fe4e8e9251416c91135ba1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1289481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Clifford","original_name":"William Clifford","popularity":0.0769,"profile_path":"/2KYCO8qooOH2n4tZnSemFv4ngEb.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dick Sayre","credit_id":"52fe4e8e9251416c91135ba5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo White","original_name":"Leo White","popularity":0.1971,"profile_path":"/pKJDApReiE0EVmmkTYbHNW7d1Yu.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Prince Halbere","credit_id":"52fe4e8e9251416c91135ba9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1273324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Rappe","original_name":"Virginia Rappe","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/kYQBVPFaacamFuEOCgqD0b6c0l8.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Vanette","credit_id":"52fe4e8e9251416c91135bad","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolph Valentino","original_name":"Rudolph Valentino","popularity":0.3549,"profile_path":"/hz1ts5wreDNjCcnfiIDWIcWpu3y.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Jacques Rudanyi","credit_id":"52fe4e8e9251416c91135bb1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stanton Heck","original_name":"Stanton Heck","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":"/shjetIq4ZDJlYvVap3cxAtJqm9g.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Grand Duke Nebo","credit_id":"52fe4e8e9251416c91135bb5","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1269195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Millsfield","original_name":"Charles Millsfield","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Pom Pom","credit_id":"52fe4e8e9251416c91135bb9","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alma Francis","original_name":"Alma Francis","popularity":0.0858,"profile_path":"/fbUt3d95jaCaaGKRtXWEoe0Z5D.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Eunice","credit_id":"52fe4e8f9251416c91135bbd","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":132321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lydia Knott","original_name":"Lydia Knott","popularity":0.0805,"profile_path":"/eKZxDbHYoY898QcfjggDNi78BvU.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Clifford Townsend's mother","credit_id":"52fe4e8f9251416c91135bc1","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1263416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fontaine La Rue","original_name":"Fontaine La Rue","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":"/gUlDAnnczXncfSFtOTHGu9wLtBO.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e8f9251416c91135bc9","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1289482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Gastrock","original_name":"Frank Gastrock","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e8f9251416c91135bcd","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1289483,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William Pearson","original_name":"William Pearson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e8f9251416c91135bd1","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1289484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederick Heck","original_name":"Frederick Heck","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e8f9251416c91135bd5","order":13}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1289479,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred J.
