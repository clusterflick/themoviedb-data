Marker went to Israel as an outsider, looking to discover the spirit of the young country through its \"language of signs.\" He found a place whose unique moral and political obligations could provide a new, humane model of nationhood to the world.  In DESCRIPTION OF A MEMORY, director Dan Geva, an Israeli, explores what has happened in his homeland in the years since with a more critical eye, asking whether the promises Marker identified have been fulfilled. Structured by thirteen memories, the film is an open-ended, essayistic meditation on the distance between the ideals that fueled the creation of Israel and the realities of its history.","popularity":0.1414,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Description of a Memory","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288634,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Geva","original_name":"Dan Geva","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e739251416c9113205b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1758094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noit Geva","original_name":"Noit Geva","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64246b1d6905fb0077efdd5a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1758094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noit Geva","original_name":"Noit Geva","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64246b4e37b3a900d5f8c7df","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288634,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Geva","original_name":"Dan Geva","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64246b64960cde0126330c79","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1480864","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Description Of A Memory","key":"bWi6lOxJMuY","published_at":"2009-06-23T18:55:42.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec72ac3a368544800bc81"}]}}}
