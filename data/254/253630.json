He brings the animal home to his twelve year old son, Rabi, who becomes so fascinated that he forgets his chores at this father's shop. When the angry smith removes the tortoise, Rabi's grandfather, Pusga, helps Rabi find a larger one to consol the boy. Rabi wants to tame the animal and this new obsession leads him to defy parental authority. Pusga gently opens the boy's eyes to the visible and invisible ways of nature. Rabi starts to understand liberty, responsibility and respect for life. In turn he awakens long buried sentiments in the grandfather.","popularity":0.3843,"poster_path":"/dwV7V9qpszA1QjtOR6SHW2LHkE0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29026,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinecom Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BF","name":"Burkina Faso"}],"release_date":"1992-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rabi","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1289278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Nikiema","original_name":"Joseph Nikiema","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e8a9251416c911350f9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1289280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joséphine Kaboré","original_name":"Joséphine Kaboré","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e8a9251416c911350fd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1349257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colette Kaboré","original_name":"Colette Kaboré","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"590751a7c3a3684a8e02e618","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1808060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yacouba Kaboré","original_name":"Yacouba Kaboré","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"590751afc3a3684a68030d33","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1808061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chantal Nikiema","original_name":"Chantal Nikiema","popularity":0.0858,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"590751b6c3a3684a8e02e62f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1808062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvia Nopoko Guem","original_name":"Sylvia Nopoko Guem","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"590751c0c3a3684b0702cbc9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1808063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Yerbanga","original_name":"Paul Yerbanga","popularity":0.0651,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"590751c792514169fb0324ca","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1808064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tinfusi Yerbanga","original_name":"Tinfusi Yerbanga","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"590751d292514169b8030644","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1808065,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent Zoundi","original_name":"Vincent Zoundi","popularity":0.0628,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"590751dac3a3684ad7031291","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1153142,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gaston Kaboré","original_name":"Gaston Kaboré","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":"/baKZufTJ17zJzYZ1Lc7QADj4BiL.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e8a9251416c91135103","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":930618,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marc Nouyrigat","original_name":"Marc Nouyrigat","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6183eb37ddd52d0026b5b702","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1720252,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marie-Jeanne Kanyala","original_name":"Marie-Jeanne Kanyala","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6183eb48a13533009130ae1a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":69551,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jean-Noël Ferragut","original_name":"Jean-Noël Ferragut","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6183eb5313a3880096d2a810","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2763710,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wally Badarou","original_name":"Wally Badarou","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6183eb5fddd52d0042b795ff","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3297036,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"René B.
