With a body unlike any before hers, she mesmerized viewers and choreographers alike. With her elongated, race-horse physique, she became the new prototype for the great George Balanchine. Because of her extraordinary movement and unique personality on stage, she became a muse to two of the greatest choreographers in dance, George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins. She eventually married Balanchine, and Robbins created his famous version of Afternoon of a Faun for her. She had love, fame, adoration, and was the foremost dancer of her day until it suddenly all stopped. At the age of 27, she was struck down by polio and paralyzed. She never danced again. The ballet world has been haunted by her story ever since.","popularity":0.2957,"poster_path":"/zVS3XjxsJW7ZaSJEcpSmnco6yEa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152942,"logo_path":null,"name":"Augusta Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":45012,"logo_path":null,"name":"Steeplechase Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Afternoon of a Faun: Tanaquil Le Clercq","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Der Nachmittag eines Fauns","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Stuhlbarg","original_name":"Michael Stuhlbarg","popularity":1.7148,"profile_path":"/aYB3SQm3h6ZyAdlbGyiNfakjx56.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Jerome Robbins (voice)","credit_id":"530db3869251411421002051","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1296679,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marianne Bower","original_name":"Marianne Bower","popularity":0.089,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Tanaquil Le Clercq (voice)","credit_id":"530db3af925141141e001fc5","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":973668,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nancy Buirski","original_name":"Nancy Buirski","popularity":0.0875,"profile_path":"/3WAjXMtUPVxEU1p0NHUVXIBLXAR.jpg","credit_id":"550e5954c3a3683f0a001570","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":973668,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nancy Buirski","original_name":"Nancy Buirski","popularity":0.0875,"profile_path":"/3WAjXMtUPVxEU1p0NHUVXIBLXAR.jpg","credit_id":"658c9a481bf87604806e77ba","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":973668,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nancy Buirski","original_name":"Nancy Buirski","popularity":0.0875,"profile_path":"/3WAjXMtUPVxEU1p0NHUVXIBLXAR.jpg","credit_id":"658c991675f1ad63e8a554ea","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2381319","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zVS3XjxsJW7ZaSJEcpSmnco6yEa.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/ysUGO5ujRlRF6VPz9a13bbFyYeC.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1400},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2UTOWWmahcc58bDsydV9slhfxlk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rksmtNvatHnifiYDZb6Er5JfcOH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Afternoon of a Faun: Tanaquil le Clercq | Trailer | New Release","key":"PdEaicb-pag","published_at":"2013-09-25T18:51:36.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"533ec72ac3a368544800bcca"}]}}}
