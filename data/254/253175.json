A thoroughly sloshed Shane MacGowan mumbles and screams his way through most of their hits to that point in time. Of course, real fans like the mumbling and the screaming.  Lots of energy, great guests - The Specials, the late Kirstie MacColl and especially the late great Joe Strummer - who not only gets up on stage for a stirring rendition of London Calling, but serves as a kind of host for the evening as he discusses what made the Pogues so great.  The video times in at a paltry 60 minutes which leaves you begging for more, but between the singalong Wild Rover and the silly string silliness of Fiesta, it is a jam-packed entertaining piece of music history.","popularity":0.4517,"poster_path":"/vkXFVcLoYNKBJLEiNUeRFoqkMtb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Happy St. Patrick's Day","title":"The Pogues Live at the Town and Country","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shane MacGowan","original_name":"Shane MacGowan","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":"/khGuyS8gZzmFaVyq5ur4OTktZ4J.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5620434792514171c5005f5b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":58631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Spider Stacy","original_name":"Spider Stacy","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/8nsdUPwugplkVwsTL7gl8DA3a8U.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56204350c3a3680e24006211","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":203696,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Earle","original_name":"Steve Earle","popularity":0.2101,"profile_path":"/wjhJ5GiZkGwlxx8DoMzHf3kqOEw.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"65ad34c9158c8500ebb8d52d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3078,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Byrne","original_name":"David Byrne","popularity":0.5258,"profile_path":"/iyD9S1hvyWjtiAedZAACDcWKuaf.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"562045089251417f470040e8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Strummer","original_name":"Joe Strummer","popularity":0.1785,"profile_path":"/yo2NXpjf2tAG8WwEkpyxUuGe1q6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5620435ac3a3680e2000614f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1522913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lynval Golding","original_name":"Lynval Golding","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":"/jcq3N90xu1SpkOBnalnlpBFP3eh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"562043d392514171d4005da2","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0221483","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vkXFVcLoYNKBJLEiNUeRFoqkMtb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1236,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dZRC9KUd0pzku6FYQ5qeMaPxal9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":824}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4470,"name":"punk rock"},{"id":11634,"name":"live performance"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
