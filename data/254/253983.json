The documentary gives voice to those who personally had to bear the weight of being \"different\", remembering how their lives were shaped by this situation during Fascism and in the aftermath of World War II, in an anthropologically and culturally widely diverse nation. Theirs is a mixed testimony of repression, censorship, dignity, courage, and happiness, making way for the final image of a world - our world - that still has a long way to go towards respect and liberty for everyone.","popularity":0.1773,"poster_path":"/4RrfiMgA1TlLZwBEILbrKZLTV3w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":317,"logo_path":"/HJj0J9Tk6AGcLpL4O7mI3bsccM.png","name":"Istituto Luce Cinecittà","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":132308,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cubovision","origin_country":""},{"id":14016,"logo_path":"/snclwsIZQbgvqYCBJP8fqNlCA5y.png","name":"MiC","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/gKP4egMJOi5rksdnplfPV1wa0sd.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Happy to Be Different","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1289898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glauco Bettera","original_name":"Glauco Bettera","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e9d9251416c91137d5b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1289899,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giorgio Bongiovanni","original_name":"Giorgio Bongiovanni","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e9d9251416c91137d5f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ninetto Davoli","original_name":"Ninetto Davoli","popularity":0.5404,"profile_path":"/bOs054IC9yaP2DDKdXdH2OEznES.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e9d9251416c91137d63","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1204946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paolo Poli","original_name":"Paolo Poli","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/a4d825ZEVKylk4jtejUtEdy4cyr.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e9d9251416c91137d67","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128107,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gianni Amelio","original_name":"Gianni Amelio","popularity":0.1424,"profile_path":"/4kw9Uc1SJyQkNHrq3umpP3H8ClZ.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e9d9251416c91137d57","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128107,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gianni Amelio","original_name":"Gianni Amelio","popularity":0.1424,"profile_path":"/4kw9Uc1SJyQkNHrq3umpP3H8ClZ.jpg","credit_id":"530f023e925141734a0006ee","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1296968,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Luan Amelio Ujkaj","original_name":"Luan Amelio Ujkaj","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/lQ2D3NL03co8utARv0hDV5r6tCW.jpg","credit_id":"530f025a925141734a0006f5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1296969,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Cecilia Pagliarani","original_name":"Cecilia Pagliarani","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"530f02779251417355000653","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3497674","wikidata_id":"Q15965651","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":809,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j2khR6IxRE50DmYippY9xSqx6UU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1571,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/4RrfiMgA1TlLZwBEILbrKZLTV3w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1047},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1921,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Ap6TOL1AUOgxc28nyYmcBImzfGp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlin International Film Festival","release_date":"2014-02-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
