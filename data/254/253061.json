Emma is a town councilwoman whose husband (Marco Giallini) has taken a mistress because he dislikes her repressed behavior. Her demeanor changes radically when the town pharmacist runs out of Emma's daily dose of depressants. Emma has a disorder in which she is naturally outgoing and upbeat. Her marriage gets rocky as she expresses her true self. The town responds poorly to a woman being so brazen, but Emma's best friend (Elda Alvigini) is inspired by Emma to make a major life change.","popularity":0.8453,"poster_path":"/e0cQe9JuQ5PhAGXoXLDNEqQmXWM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":176526,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Trust
