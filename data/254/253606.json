He is creative and free-spirited, and he loves his Danish wife, but unfortunately the rules and regulations of the Danish and Swedish societies obstruct their wish to live a peaceful life. They embark on a Kafkaesque journey through the European legal systems, and end up not being allowed to stay in Denmark, or Sweden; in fact anywhere at all. As the legal decisions threaten to ruin their relationship, Camilo ultimately faces an impossible dilemma: Should he go back to Cuba, possibly ending up in prison, or should he stay in Scandinavia illegally, with or without the love of his life?","popularity":0.0641,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Art of Crossing a Bridge","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":135968,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Asger Lindgaard","original_name":"Asger Lindgaard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/ml25OK5zHIpYOtr30XTFLdQEw2b.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e889251416c91134d17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2023725","wikidata_id":"Q20757251","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
