A Maine farmer says she found a chicken frozen stiff, but was able to resuscitate it. Colorado natives tell a story of the chicken who lost its head-- and went on living. A Virginia farmer tells about (and demonstrates) the benefits of raising chickens for his own consumption. Perhaps most surprising is the case of the Florida woman: she bathes her pet bird, and takes it both swimming and shopping. Through these and other stories, this documentary illuminates the role that chickens play in (some of) our lives.","popularity":0.2425,"poster_path":"/qEujQPEenpd1CgSL8M3ApoGdJf8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14501,"logo_path":null,"name":"DeVillier Donegan Enterprizes","origin_country":""},{"id":109796,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mark Lewis Radio Pictures","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Natural History of the Chicken","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Kanahistoria","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Istories gia kotoules","type":"festival title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":548480,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Lewis","original_name":"Mark Lewis","popularity":0.1144,"profile_path":"/8TWe0m49h32aYk5symCm7mOQ2tw.jpg","credit_id":"6195cd0829733800430b1c3b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":576008,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Steve Arnold","original_name":"Steve Arnold","popularity":0.0877,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6195cdb829733800430b1d5c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1038508,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grover Babcock","original_name":"Grover Babcock","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c31a2c2fe2fa012f294e47","department":"Production","job":"Production Consultant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1576262,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Thomas J.
