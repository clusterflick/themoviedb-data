Today, oil is our only option for transportation-fuel at the pump. Our exclusive use of it has drained our wallets, increased air pollution and sent our sons and daughters to war in faraway lands. PUMP shows how, through the use of a variety of replacement fuels, we will be able to fill up our cars — cheaper, cleaner and American made — and in the process create more jobs for a stronger, healthier economy. Narrated by Jason Bateman and featuring notable experts such as John Hofmeister former President of Shell Oil, and Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla Motors, PUMP will forever change the way you think about your car — and the fuel that powers it.","popularity":0.9468,"poster_path":"/upTmZFoRES29c2G9lP0mrNrglKZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Under this hood is the solution to our oil adddiction... but someone wants to keep it a secret.","title":"Pump","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":16,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Pump!","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Pump – Histórias do petróleo","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Bateman","original_name":"Jason Bateman","popularity":3.0617,"profile_path":"/8e6mt0vGjPo6eW52gqRuXy5YnfN.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator (Voice)","credit_id":"66a19d99ca23087b4acf6efb","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74601,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Johnny O'Hara","original_name":"Johnny O'Hara","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53fcf330c3a3684c77000002","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74600,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joshua Tickell","original_name":"Joshua Tickell","popularity":0.0753,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53fcf309c3a3684c7a000003","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1141509,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rebecca Harrell","original_name":"Rebecca Harrell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53fcf31cc3a3684c7d000004","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2756859,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sean P.
