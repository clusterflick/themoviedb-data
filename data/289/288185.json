As a white girl growing up in the South, Joan witnessed the ugly realities of segregation and racism firsthand and vowed to one day change it. By the time she was 19, she had already joined the Freedom Riders and participated in over three dozen sit-ins and protests. Despite being attacked by angry mobs, put on death row in the notorious Parchman Penitentiary, and coming face-to-face with the KKK, Joan never wavered from her belief that we are all created equal.","popularity":0.1839,"poster_path":"/yVze578ooD9bKvUt7Mb73dxmhdT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What's easy and what's right are rarely the same thing.","title":"An Ordinary Hero: The True Story of Joan Trumpauer Mulholland","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"An Ordinary Hero","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1596629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luvaughn Brown","original_name":"Luvaughn Brown","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56f6c4b49251413007001a41","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1596631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dion Diamond","original_name":"Dion Diamond","popularity":0.0243,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56f6c4bd9251412cc0000ce5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1596632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Etheridge","original_name":"Eric Etheridge","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56f6c4c692514155f8003ccc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3603575,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reginald Green","original_name":"Reginald Green","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":29,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62b9839f84f24903eb73a564","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1596633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorie Ladner","original_name":"Dorie Ladner","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56f6c4e69251411a61001d28","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1596634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joyce Ladner","original_name":"Joyce Ladner","popularity":0.0935,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56f6c4eec3a3686a5e0040ff","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1596635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Luckett","original_name":"Robert Luckett","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56f6c4f7c3a3686a5e004104","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1596636,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joan Mulholland","original_name":"Joan Mulholland","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56f6c5099251413007001a53","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1596638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John R.
