Upon arriving, Lorenzo is offered a short-term position as coach for an American-style football team by the team's manager, Giulio Fellini (Maurizio Nichetti). As the young American immerses himself in his new duties, he makes the acquaintance of Paola Angelini (Violante Placido) and the two begin a friendship that quickly blossoms into something more. In between spending time with Paola and working with the team, Lorenzo also begins investigating his own family's history and learns the reason for his grandfather's departure from Italy, as well as why his grandfather never returned to visit. As Lorenzo begins to forge an identity for himself in Italy -- not to mention strong romantic attachments to Paola -- he must eventually decide whether or not to return to the States.","popularity":1.4353,"poster_path":"/uRkyUAZN4Xt5DarBBJ4xktYID15.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124621,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bentornato Lorenzo Primavera Ltd.","origin_country":""},{"id":124622,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mavex Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":15130,"logo_path":null,"name":"Urania Pictures","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ciao America","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106434,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Malavarca","original_name":"Eddie Malavarca","popularity":0.1302,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Lorenzo Primavera","credit_id":"5b1001da9251415ee90085fb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurizio Nichetti","original_name":"Maurizio Nichetti","popularity":0.1828,"profile_path":"/uZRUbJXs1p0Q0o0lyTSL0ZB7cCf.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Giulio Fellini","credit_id":"5b1001ec0e0a26307300703f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":44649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Violante Placido","original_name":"Violante Placido","popularity":0.948,"profile_path":"/qVs8LdHIU2E5RlSuSr4MK0zyf7B.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Paola Angelini","credit_id":"5b1001f6c3a3686221003d35","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":211998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathaniel Marston","original_name":"Nathaniel Marston","popularity":0.1493,"profile_path":"/tArZgn9e4S9T1GQrwHIkkMIgmrf.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Skip Cromwell","credit_id":"5b1002149251415e970055cb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":176628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony DeSando","original_name":"Anthony DeSando","popularity":0.2107,"profile_path":"/2ahZUm3RDSRIlRJZUxh7MFTD6jV.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Frank Mantovani","credit_id":"5b100225c3a36862150089ea","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giancarlo Giannini","original_name":"Giancarlo Giannini","popularity":1.0061,"profile_path":"/xsnoThKUjFlhmvXKS4ZqAx1x3zb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Zi' Felice","credit_id":"5b1002350e0a26308e0072a3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Sorvino","original_name":"Paul Sorvino","popularity":1.2158,"profile_path":"/1gF0UskusEdDcNaBDJ2CMsz5Agi.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Antonio Primavera","credit_id":"5b1002440e0a26307300708c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":203457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vittorio Amandola","original_name":"Vittorio Amandola","popularity":0.142,"profile_path":"/dE6WnX5yh550Q4PIGGvWU4uHu7S.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5b1002579251415ee9008652","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincenzo Amato","original_name":"Vincenzo Amato","popularity":0.3335,"profile_path":"/6fI2F4puhODCgDVtFBLiSFtkaHL.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5b10025d0e0a26307a007476","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1024225,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Basile","original_name":"Marco Basile","popularity":0.1209,"profile_path":"/suLOUPrk9ZedewiahvnAmfoTZZV.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5b100270c3a368623000a002","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2054369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorenza Mazzetti","original_name":"Lorenza Mazzetti","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":"/k7zLNBv0w3KIot9eqFmvPEhN3wF.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5b10027a9251415ea00071e6","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":137810,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierpaolo Lovino","original_name":"Pierpaolo Lovino","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/gyPtSS5pBX9UqRgJdtdccGRR9dy.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5b10029bc3a3686233005a2f","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2382367,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Ciota","original_name":"Frank Ciota","popularity":0.0356,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4d7b6d1283e90016885ea2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2382369,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joseph A.
