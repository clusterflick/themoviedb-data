Two movers are talking to each other about the murder of a saxophone player that took place in the house. They say his ghost still roams the house. Night comes and every noise and creak in the house scares the papa, mama and son (the daughter is out on a date). The Mover gives the daughter a parrot saying \"It's a religious parrot â€“ I bought it from a sailor\". At any rate, the parrot gets into the act by yelling scaring Papa and Son who have come down looking for the source of the noise. Later Daughter and Remover return from a costume party and sneak into the house. The young man is dressed in a skeleton outfit and the fun continues. There has been film reconstruction in a number of places, particularly the last third of the film. In many cases there is a photograph depicting the scene being described.","popularity":0.3645,"poster_path":"/snRjxtLdVBDRo34NPg0Iv2Z9cEI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hal Roach Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1928-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Came the Dawn","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Davidson","original_name":"Max Davidson","popularity":0.1765,"profile_path":"/yo57wZr0Fx0hyklCf0ykqPIOqVU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Papa Gimplewort","credit_id":"53fb81130e0a267a78008231","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gene Morgan","original_name":"Gene Morgan","popularity":0.1763,"profile_path":"/wtrHqTGeno7LczG8UWOUit0Egoc.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The Head Remover","credit_id":"53fb811e0e0a267a6c008513","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Polly Moran","original_name":"Polly Moran","popularity":0.2533,"profile_path":"/2lzTBafNt2z9hfbCIoyPJTwVs1y.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mama Gimplewort","credit_id":"53fb81290e0a267a69008591","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":141137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viola Richard","original_name":"Viola Richard","popularity":0.1077,"profile_path":"/6GB6U4AkGv3v09M6qWHCsQHVMHz.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"The Gimplewort Daughter","credit_id":"53fb81310e0a267a78008236","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":136529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Dorety","original_name":"Charles Dorety","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/nAp7j4pXQjdXII7TxRq8SQwNjcv.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"The Gimplewort Son","credit_id":"53fb813d0e0a267a78008238","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1240252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edgar Dearing","original_name":"Edgar Dearing","popularity":0.1675,"profile_path":"/gD7Fd6ksHRGNnWFOw0qv9v8QVmd.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Big Moving Man (uncredited)","credit_id":"53fb81480e0a267a7800823d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie Hall","original_name":"Charlie Hall","popularity":0.2577,"profile_path":"/huLPhEhh8pO9v0gSJb7HVB76GRZ.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Little Moving Man (uncredited)","credit_id":"53fb81630e0a267a78008241","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33223,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hal Roach","original_name":"Hal Roach","popularity":0.2083,"profile_path":"/cV3xbMdZEQdNhHKdI9T6BL2PBSy.jpg","credit_id":"53fb80a50e0a267a78008229","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33223,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hal Roach","original_name":"Hal Roach","popularity":0.2083,"profile_path":"/cV3xbMdZEQdNhHKdI9T6BL2PBSy.jpg","credit_id":"53fb80d50e0a267a6f008575","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131383,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"H.M.
