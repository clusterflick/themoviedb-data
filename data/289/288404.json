A single stationary camera was mounted inside the center of a large rotating platform. As the platform rotated around the camera, a scene would come into view of the camera. The wheel would stop and a sketch would play out in the scene, which was often framed by some piece of appropriate artwork or prop (for the purposes of forced perspective). At the end of the scene, the wheel would rotate, carrying one scene out of the camera's view and bringing another in, and a new sketch would begin in the new scene. Some scenes were self-contained on the platform, while others were open to the studio beyond the platform (and additional action would take place in the background).","popularity":2.0287,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3268,"logo_path":"/tuomPhY2UtuPTqqFnKMVHvSb724.png","name":"HBO","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The TV Wheel","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The X-Box is Turning","type":"alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30024,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Joel Hodgson","original_name":"Joel Hodgson","popularity":0.3018,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"562d21bf9251412857008010","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Cross","original_name":"David Cross","popularity":1.2696,"profile_path":"/dZyQ61KLra7JpkkoSeWIUvgEA1K.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Various","credit_id":"562d21cf9251412845007be5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":176022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Kindler","original_name":"Andy Kindler","popularity":0.2086,"profile_path":"/5vTuS8ZneKGIUxeY9PdsJ4ozBct.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Various","credit_id":"562d21e992514140060069b3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":162610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Stoller","original_name":"Fred Stoller","popularity":0.5701,"profile_path":"/zKdycmQYPQe7OoYWaz0KU5yCqXx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Various","credit_id":"562d22099251412845007bee","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doug Benson","original_name":"Doug Benson","popularity":0.2364,"profile_path":"/gOkRMI6opB6EfIo4xTGqzHasgvc.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Various","credit_id":"562d224ac3a3681b4b007c89","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Allen","original_name":"Dave Allen","popularity":0.4199,"profile_path":"/voFl4dudgMmfBKsF0HJAOJGXXEx.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Various","credit_id":"5e08bc23d285af0016927abc","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":59070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morwenna Banks","original_name":"Morwenna Banks","popularity":0.2987,"profile_path":"/oraLxvDNim7ixQEcJz9nVqgy0eT.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Various","credit_id":"6656c3045555febc80a6db26","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":177621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melissa Samuels","original_name":"Melissa Samuels","popularity":0.1165,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Various","credit_id":"6656c3575949857d7309fbf1","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78435,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Bakay","original_name":"Nick Bakay","popularity":0.4239,"profile_path":"/yzmDfEG14D8WVG1ebh1a24jUSR2.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Various","credit_id":"6656c379aa207f2714f8f259","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Bannos","original_name":"Steve Bannos","popularity":0.2943,"profile_path":"/a5Dxy6MnpeYL5JRWI888tO9VvXL.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Various","credit_id":"6656c39caa207f2714f8f263","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2372417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Carney","original_name":"John Carney","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Various","credit_id":"6656c3ec32c4b05355a3a140","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116805,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Feig","original_name":"Paul Feig","popularity":0.6857,"profile_path":"/mE3eFY3gq1UQ7Rj2He2YbZ7PFya.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Various","credit_id":"6656c411950ca1382209f8ad","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":192268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lawrence T.
