Brown essays the title role of Chip Bennett, foreman of the Flying U ranch. Before the second reel has tumbled over the spools, Chip finds himself falsely accused of robbery and murder. The actual miscreants are in the employ of a band of foreign gunrunners, who speak in heavily Teutonic accents. Rest assured that Chip makes short work of these bush-league Storm Troopers before the sun sets in the West. Musical interludes are provided by a group calling themselves the Texas Rangers, even though they actually hailed from Kansas City.","popularity":0.6634,"poster_path":"/bzVQTAB5htg2z3ry0DiZNp9CcZ9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1939-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"LIKE A BOMBSHELL OF FURY....they smash the munitions smugglers!","title":"Chip of the Flying U","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Mack Brown","original_name":"Johnny Mack Brown","popularity":0.1439,"profile_path":"/ybBL0QUDeYqwuDOenOl8N1ACaal.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"'Chip' Bennett","credit_id":"53fb49750e0a267a75007eb3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1356902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Baker","original_name":"Bob Baker","popularity":0.1107,"profile_path":"/yQI4rIGxcMwfTyXefgsvxB5BmDH.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"'Dusty'","credit_id":"53fb49860e0a267a72007ed2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fuzzy Knight","original_name":"Fuzzy Knight","popularity":0.1765,"profile_path":"/vv3sXhvCEpZxeG8WucH4p6JdaYl.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"'Weary'","credit_id":"53fb49910e0a267a78007b6e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1113314,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doris Weston","original_name":"Doris Weston","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/aQCWNubyFjUW5wo3sXN5D2E6SG.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Margaret Whitmore","credit_id":"53fb499f0e0a267a6f007ee2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Forrest Taylor","original_name":"Forrest Taylor","popularity":0.1304,"profile_path":"/11tiZFYeWNfefJccEhNU4G3cYzp.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"J.G.
