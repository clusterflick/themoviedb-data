After a portentous dream about a white elephant, the ancient Hindu princess Maya gives birth to a prince. Reared in seclusion from the troubles of the world, Prince Siddhartha is troubled by sights of poverty and deprivation when he is 12 years old. He is married to a beautiful wife, but he is unable to bear the thought of others suffering, and leaves the palace in search of an answer. While sitting beneath a tree, he achieves enlightenment.  Planned as a nine-reel life of Buddha, but exhibited in Cannes as ‘Part One’ with only 6 reels completed, this late work by Noburô Ôfuji was not completed until after his death. It was only in 1961 that it was finally exhibited as a full 72-minute film (comprising 10 reels).","popularity":0.2397,"poster_path":"/osdKpvvKFvXj80y2e8S26SNomYl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1961-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Life of Buddha","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Shaka no shogai","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shintarō Katsu","original_name":"勝新太郎","popularity":0.6365,"profile_path":"/ziw06aCqJi0UG4S6xiAadAkljor.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"592a37cb9251413b8a055639","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1147441,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noburô Ôfuji","original_name":"大藤信郎","popularity":0.0613,"profile_path":"/mio3xCkv9riDqEKCyb2CDEwB07e.jpg","credit_id":"53f9bce4c3a3687358002bfd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0055439","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/osdKpvvKFvXj80y2e8S26SNomYl.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1961-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
