Böttger is equipped with everything he would need for the task, but he has known for a while that actual gold production is a myth and instead experiments with porcelain—white porcelain, as the Chinese are said to possess. In 1709, he finally succeeds in surprising the King with the \"white gold,\" the first white porcelain made in Europe, he hopes for freedom.","popularity":0.3238,"poster_path":"/znzfd35azZQjj0zdYjIy9jHC5f2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":602,"logo_path":"/pVsXRFbYVDe5BhsATCAh1rt5F0k.png","name":"DEFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1949-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Blue Swords","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Blue Swords","type":"(Englischer Titel)"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26575,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Quest","original_name":"Hans Quest","popularity":0.1044,"profile_path":"/xSYpTy7ChmQIX5yyGUwCMl9r1yL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Johann Böttger","credit_id":"53fcfb2cc3a3684c77000066","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilse Steppat","original_name":"Ilse Steppat","popularity":0.1427,"profile_path":"/i7vozT464DswFdYJJ3bFUacWdLR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Frau von Tschirnhausen","credit_id":"53fcfb3ac3a3684c80000064","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert Hübner","original_name":"Herbert Hübner","popularity":0.2858,"profile_path":"/hUHd2MXZM7t7gxEh7p6zBMDLAuh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Nehmitz","credit_id":"53fcfb4ec3a3684c80000066","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Bessler","original_name":"Albert Bessler","popularity":0.2918,"profile_path":"/iyhvL62a8S2LY5UeMyHicohPU4J.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Finanzminister","credit_id":"53fcfb60c3a3684c7d000070","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Engel","original_name":"Alexander Engel","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":"/IO2sUn8p6SOs1KLq76mCxOueiS.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Herr von Tschirnhausen","credit_id":"58bd4cd2c3a3680df8000961","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willy A.
