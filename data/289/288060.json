The original screenplay has also been lost. However, some plot descriptions are still known based on contemporary newspaper advertisements of the film.  As the name would indicate, the film tells about two local men who are making moonshine in the woods. A customer comes to them, and while sampling the product they start a game of cards, which eventually leads to a fight. While the fight is going on, the local police shows up and arrests the makers while the customer manages to escape.(Wikipedia)","popularity":0.3786,"poster_path":"/4GQIIcmW1HqQWvkW58nxx98eBkI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56799,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atelier Apollo","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1907-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Salaviinanpolttajat","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Salaviinan polttajat","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1033235,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Teuvo Puro","original_name":"Teuvo Puro","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/bKt3uL7MAFEiGJMhZRbOLhjL6lP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"junkkari","credit_id":"53f717550e0a267f8900754e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1355568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teppo Raikas","original_name":"Teppo Raikas","popularity":0.0723,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"salapolttaja","credit_id":"53f7175e0e0a267f80007635","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1270129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eero Kilpi","original_name":"Eero Kilpi","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"salapolttaja","credit_id":"53f7174e0e0a267f77007492","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jussi Snellman","original_name":"Jussi Snellman","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"nimismies","credit_id":"559145d1c3a368572f0001f7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1482884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Rautio","original_name":"Alex Rautio","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"nimismiehen apulainen","credit_id":"559145ca925141758c0011b8","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1270130,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Karl Fager","original_name":"Karl Fager","popularity":0.0805,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6267bfae4ccc50009cb1bf7f","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1717313,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Frans Engström","original_name":"Frans Engström","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6267bff11f98d1009ad6704d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1355567,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Louis Sparre","original_name":"Louis Sparre","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53f717350e0a267f7700748e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1033235,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Teuvo Puro","original_name":"Teuvo Puro","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/bKt3uL7MAFEiGJMhZRbOLhjL6lP.jpg","credit_id":"53f717440e0a267f7d0075b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1717312,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"K.E.
