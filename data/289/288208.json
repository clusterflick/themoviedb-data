Whether you're a longtime death metal fan, a casual listener, or a complete newcomer to the scene, this insightful documentary features an in depth look at one of the music world's least explored genres that will educate as well as entertain. Presented with absolutely no pre-existing agenda, Death Metal follows former Carnivore vocalist Peter Steele as he gazes into the black heart of the least explored style in the heavy-metal spectrum. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","popularity":0.3328,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":20952,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bill Zebub Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Death Metal: A Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1355729,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Peter Steele","original_name":"Peter Steele","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":"/3mKMFA2SkIXc5nDN0BmtwadkEf1.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Peter Steele","credit_id":"53f7bc780e0a267f8d008725","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Zebub","original_name":"Bill Zebub","popularity":0.2551,"profile_path":"/bhZNgeH9PbnxFCsKeOZEzBVewQ1.jpg","credit_id":"5d89060ec58acd00212cbed9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10039416","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":204425,"name":"death metal"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-05-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
