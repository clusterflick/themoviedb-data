Coming from very different worlds, anxiety is the only thing they have in common. One of them is Antonieta Sanchez, a single mother who has made ends meet for herself and her son, Odulio, by washing clothes and ironing. She knows she has lost her son a long time ago: Odulio is a young criminal. The night he was shot, Antonieta's life changed forever. The other is Benigno Robles, an assistant district attorney who, as a young law student, devoted his career with hope and deeply rooted ideals of justice. When Elisa, his only daughter, is hit by a stray bullet, Benigno will never be the same. But this encounter between Antonieta and Benigno, seemingly coincidental, is not: there is a secret that will eventually come to light","popularity":0.1451,"poster_path":"/yWBOlV7idJp9qYNOfdH2EPoEL7p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103030,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alfarería Cinematográfica","origin_country":""},{"id":114124,"logo_path":"/kFBKWa13gxWg1tB8GQOMqgPm4y8.png","name":"Jerico Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":114125,"logo_path":null,"name":"Procine","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"2008-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Enemy","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":588996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniela Alvarado","original_name":"Daniela Alvarado","popularity":0.1356,"profile_path":"/suESHSZ2KuWJy8asohEbpDj9Skp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Elisa","credit_id":"53fa5dae0e0a267a66005a7c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1356659,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Cruz","original_name":"Carlos Cruz","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/oQ2xcqcs2LNcishAYhbQheaoSvc.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Benigno Robles","credit_id":"53fa5dc30e0a267a7b0058b2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":985144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elba Escobar","original_name":"Elba Escobar","popularity":0.1774,"profile_path":"/vaxIqobzvzaqxKPrh7Nq6KqxUYu.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Nora","credit_id":"53fa5dcf0e0a267a75005b86","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1356647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lourdes Valera","original_name":"Lourdes Valera","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Antonieta Sánchez","credit_id":"53fa5de10e0a267a6c005a3a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1004031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aroldo Betancourt","original_name":"Aroldo Betancourt","popularity":0.1373,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67097172b0c4f7a5361a2ccf","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937621,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luis Alberto Lamata","original_name":"Luis Alberto Lamata","popularity":0.0719,"profile_path":"/w1YlCP0c2Q4j5FIijJTTwolz6UB.jpg","credit_id":"53fa5d570e0a267a75005b7c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937621,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luis Alberto Lamata","original_name":"Luis Alberto Lamata","popularity":0.0719,"profile_path":"/w1YlCP0c2Q4j5FIijJTTwolz6UB.jpg","credit_id":"53fa5d660e0a267a69005c13","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":987624,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alejandro García Wiedemann","original_name":"Alejandro Wiedemann","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53fa5d750e0a267a7b0058a8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1356658,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Fermín Branger","original_name":"Fermín Branger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53fa5d8a0e0a267a6c005a2b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1205908","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/yWBOlV7idJp9qYNOfdH2EPoEL7p.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
