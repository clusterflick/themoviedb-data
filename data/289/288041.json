In particular, he misses eating stewed tomatoes, the fruit which he believes incorrectly is being rationed as a war measure. Mrs. Doakes knows that tomatoes aren't rationed, but she doesn't correct him, especially after he announces that he will grow enough tomatoes to feed the entire block. As he proceeds with his tomato garden, he, unaware of what it actually takes to grow tomato plants successfully, accepts advice from the many people who are willing to give it. The problem ends up being that much of the advice is conflicting. But at the end of the process, Joe is pleased with the fact of having grown a fruit to maturity - regardless of the actual yield of the garden - until someone else, or something else, has a say in what happens to that fruit.","popularity":0.2014,"poster_path":"/hvV4aUzbyq7kdYhXJhknYZMIXCl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1943-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Tomato","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Benchley","original_name":"Robert Benchley","popularity":0.1837,"profile_path":"/qXJtEUZW459w8hKEcvo4FauhOBy.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Joseph A.
