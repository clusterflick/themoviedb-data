In her Chelsea Hotel apartment, home for over thirty years, she patches together her journeys, from apartheid's 'pattern of brokenness', to a chance meeting and recording with Duke Ellington in Paris, to making a life in New York. The narrative of her journeys are inter-woven with her music and the musings of folks who know her work. Like her haunting song, Windsong, the film is a meditation on displacement, exile and belonging.","popularity":0.3424,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SH","name":"St. Helena"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sathima's Windsong","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1355611,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Yon","original_name":"Daniel Yon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53f75939c3a36833f7005756","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1864476","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":612,"name":"hotel"},{"id":409,"name":"africa"},{"id":3017,"name":"jazz singer or musician"},{"id":3644,"name":"south africa"},{"id":176806,"name":"cape town, south africa"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
