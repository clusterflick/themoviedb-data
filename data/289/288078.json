Taking its cue from the realist tradition, the film counterposes an idyllic rural life (destroyed but the greedy money-lender who uses forged papers to steal the peasant's land) with the harsh city life. The shot of a hut accompanied by a howling dog are regarded as one of the most memorable moments of Indian cinema to date.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/rWT7nKuwKaXsqLCiXJf4iT6QQX8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1925-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Indian Shylock: The Original Silent Version","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"Savkari Pash","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1199441,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shantaram Rajaram Vankudre","original_name":"Shantaram Rajaram Vankudre","popularity":0.235,"profile_path":"/fnwpiPWvbL0dcOjIQUXvMuvULvy.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"53f738d90e0a267f80007978","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1355584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zunzharrao Pawar","original_name":"Zunzharrao Pawar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"53f738e10e0a267f7d007a4d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1355585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kamaladevi","original_name":"Kamaladevi","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"53f738e80e0a267f770077fc","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1335598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Baburao Painter","original_name":"Baburao Painter","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53f738cf0e0a267f80007976","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0249939","wikidata_id":"Q20649815","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":837,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rWT7nKuwKaXsqLCiXJf4iT6QQX8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1925-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
