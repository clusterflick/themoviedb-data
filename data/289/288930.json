The film -- made over the course of three years and two continents -- scrutinizes the scientific research surrounding the diagnosis of Munchausen's and, in doing so, questions the very diagnosis itself. The filmmakers document the struggles of three average families battling the charge of Munchausen's with various, tragic results.","popularity":0.0917,"poster_path":"/4u66juxXIDivtSTGqEflG6YLTha.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2291,"logo_path":null,"name":"Journeyman
