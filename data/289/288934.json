He occupies a unique position in the art world as an outsider who is a Trustee of the Tate Gallery, an artist whose work appears in The Guardian and also a school on the East End. What distinguishes Bob from mainstream contemporary art is his commitment to the idea that art is a vital part of democracy, and that art itself must be democratic. The film follows Bob over 3 years providing a unique insight into one of Britain's most important artists at work reflecting on art and the role it plays in society today.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Make Your Own Damn Art: The World of Bob and Roberta Smith","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3203584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Brill","original_name":"Patrick Brill","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"611dd6939f0e190028dbd65a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1125170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Rogers","original_name":"John Rogers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"611df5b92e0697005da2dfc0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1763966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Amrhein","original_name":"Joe Amrhein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"611df5fbcc9683007e13d668","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3203686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cedar Lewinsohn","original_name":"Cedar Lewinsohn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"611df659719aeb002e5a8829","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1125170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Rogers","original_name":"John Rogers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611dd6302dc44e0045bfa5e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3203584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Brill","original_name":"Patrick Brill","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611dd6a2cc96830045f99399","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1125170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Rogers","original_name":"John Rogers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611dd6532dc44e0045bfa688","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1125170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Rogers","original_name":"John Rogers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611dd63c6c19ea007fb8bd98","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
