That's why his wife Elke and the children are looking forward to vacationing together in Amrum. Arriving on the idyllic island, Rolf falls victim to a treacherous attack. With the help of the young hitchhiker Olaf, he gets off lightly. Rolf feels at the mercy of an invisible opponent. Because the local police only investigates half-heartedly, he tries to find the perpetrators himself. But inspector Spiekermann has found that all his professional skills cannot help him.","popularity":0.5154,"poster_path":"/rziPlVHNjORpaZDLIEZzwRYd09X.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":193843,"logo_path":null,"name":"Polyphon
