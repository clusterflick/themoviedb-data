As two investigators begin to unravel the story of the lab and its experiments, they discover that the scientist may have started the fire himself with the intention of killing his own daughter. The journals of the scientist and of the lab's founder, Dr. Patricia Morella, tell the tale of genetics experiments going badly awry and of the deceit that was used to hide them even from some of those that were involved. Dr. Morella's legacy is a clone whose only goal in life is its own survival and reproduction...no matter what the cost!","popularity":1.4427,"poster_path":"/2h0gNwwGI3uE6glNvXhIW8mtRqy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":150432,"logo_path":null,"name":"Allott
