Things go awry for the couple when she gives birth to a mentally defective child. For Georg, coldly clinical, euthanizing the infant is the only way out. He is about to commit the irreparable when Barbara manages to interrupt his fatal act. By mutual agreement, husband and wife decide that Barbara will go to Saint-Guénolé in Brittany, where she and their son will be cared for by Louise Kerbrec, Georg's former nurse, in the hypothetical hope that the boy's condition will improve. What they do not know yet is that Barbara will meet there another doctor, Daniel Karentis, much more sympathetic than Georg and also much handsomer.","popularity":0.2783,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":2110,"logo_path":null,"name":"Inter West Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1955-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Master Over Life and Death","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Dans tes bras","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":40954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Schell","original_name":"Maria Schell","popularity":0.721,"profile_path":"/8QbUcO9leIKtSfRruPqZWejrXt6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Barbara Bertram","credit_id":"53fb3b42c3a3687361004a21","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Desny","original_name":"Ivan Desny","popularity":0.2505,"profile_path":"/cf2mRMgj9XpWEHfBqRRc6h88vDz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dr. Daniel Karentis","credit_id":"53fb3b4dc3a3687352004abf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilhelm Borchert","original_name":"Wilhelm Borchert","popularity":0.1679,"profile_path":"/uAtz47j4Okqe7FpEnUK6fvNOBTK.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Professor Georg Bertram","credit_id":"53fb3b6dc3a368734c0048fb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fritz Tillmann","original_name":"Fritz Tillmann","popularity":0.1338,"profile_path":"/hXMS5cEKRCT174gmzt8sjDt7vkG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dr. Peter","credit_id":"53fb3b87c3a368735e004c20","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reinhold Bernt","original_name":"Reinhold Bernt","popularity":0.2114,"profile_path":"/wXzLxaPuwz3iydULeO3XjSxKqfl.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bahnwärter","credit_id":"53fb3b99c3a3687352004ac3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Bluhm","original_name":"Walter Bluhm","popularity":0.089,"profile_path":"/ajzAFBRKA8ibEHPO8J40oC7t3zT.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Werner Hansen","credit_id":"5412da8dc3a3682f700010df","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1531781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Reinhardt","original_name":"Arthur Reinhardt","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5b0b3de89251411d2f00d775","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51417,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victor Vicas","original_name":"Victor Vicas","popularity":0.142,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53fb3b21c3a368734f0047fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0047080","wikidata_id":"Q17575684","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1955-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
