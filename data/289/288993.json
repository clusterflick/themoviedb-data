The island lays silently on the margins of geography, entrapped in the footnotes of history, a forgotten place frozen in time.  It was on Herschel Island that a young Inuvialuit boy, Nuligak (later named Bob Cockney by the missionaries) came of age — fascinated by Herschel, but equally repelled by the excess of so-called civilization. Through Nuligak’s touching yet tragic life story, expressed through his writings and echoed by his grandchildren’s poignant return to the Island, we are offered a unique view into an often troubling past and a potentially hopeful future.","popularity":0.2471,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":28800,"logo_path":null,"name":"White Pine
