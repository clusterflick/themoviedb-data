Placed in a surreal yet pastoral surrounding, \"Goodbye\" is a letter explored through the journey of agarwood, or jin-koh, a rare oil created by a genus of tree infected with a fungal spore. The piece examines how an intangible object can impress greatly on personal history by relating perfume to memory. Experimenting with the abilities of the Bolex H16 and sound print film stock, this 16mm film was shot and hand-processed at Phil Hoffman's Independent Imaging Retreat.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":"/anBHay7pmM1YX819tbJCtK8cSxE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Goodbye","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1786572,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel McIntyre","original_name":"Daniel McIntyre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d2541766d4c9760cb745fc0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/anBHay7pmM1YX819tbJCtK8cSxE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
