The cause of all this excitement resides in the Parker apartment on the floor above where the doctor has gone to call on his sweetheart Kitty. She is in a dither because her father has decreed that she marry Gus Woozle, the pickle king. Dr. West and Kitty are planning to elope, but when her father returns unexpectedly, Kitty hides her lover in the boudoir. Parker tells his daughter that he has sent for Alderman Smiggles to officiate at her wedding and, to prevent any deviation in his plans, locks Kitty in her bedroom. Soon after, the detective arrives and arrests both Woozle and Parker for the doctor's disappearance. In their absence, Alderman Smiggles arrives and marries Kitty to the doctor.","popularity":0.0465,"poster_path":"/r0X3DJQt6HbR8MImkhcPHM1QVmn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":120614,"logo_path":null,"name":"Schomer-Ross Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1920-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Chamber Mystery","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":992910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Whitney","original_name":"Claire Whitney","popularity":0.5842,"profile_path":"/sDSErFfsLHJtQXYIOv0Suz6zHrp.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Kitty Parker","credit_id":"5d267735caab6d0014952e06","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1321526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Earl Metcalfe","original_name":"Earl Metcalfe","popularity":0.1112,"profile_path":"/tzPQMeoSedRxH7BUFy1zCHjZJ3S.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dr. Carroll West","credit_id":"5d26773bb97442000faf8d7b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2359013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Edwards","original_name":"Sam Edwards","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Peter Parker","credit_id":"5d26775a74645700136c0c4f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2359014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Lee Allen","original_name":"Robert Lee Allen","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Gus Woozle","credit_id":"5d267766b974420010af90cb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1796892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camille Dalberg","original_name":"Camille Dalberg","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/9CxpgfHA07xVaemOXEddvYIdXyh.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mrs. West","credit_id":"5d26776dcaab6d0012952e2a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5052868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Walker","original_name":"Dorothy Walker","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Ann","credit_id":"67321bc861626ac106be7a29","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2416147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Howard Morgan","original_name":"Howard Morgan","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Mr. Smiggles","credit_id":"67321be73af8eb3e35aa27d9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1370580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricca Allen","original_name":"Ricca Allen","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/zKVAS0G1ARYHUT6P3oVIBTmWp6W.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Mrs. Smiggles","credit_id":"67321bf9bc3ff7b4d1bef1b2","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1366692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred R.
