Since Giulia has started working again, it is Carlo who takes care of the children and the household chores. However, he starts to find the role of “Mr. Mom” a bit tight-fitting. Just when he decides to get back into the game and look for a job, Giulia reveals to him that she is up for a promotion that would lead her to move to Sweden. As if that weren’t enough, she will have to take the interview on December 24 in Stockholm. Everything seems to threaten the family unity. What should they do? Carlo comes up with a \"brilliant\" idea… To recover the old camper and drag the family into an adventure that will lead them on a journey to the North to spend Christmas all together lovingly. Unexpected events along the way and a hilarious encounter/confrontation with a self-styled Santa Claus will make the trip unforgettable.","popularity":0.8338,"poster_path":"/zRTauOf9RcgD8Qf6bavSc8mECqW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6246,"logo_path":"/7X6pfxldTiOD7MLo2EQqUQlmOUw.png","name":"Medusa Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":2534,"logo_path":"/6aizJC0RRO5oprJMYf2PBAB7lyZ.png","name":"Colorado Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Mom Is Away...
