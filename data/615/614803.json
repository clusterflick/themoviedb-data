While Daniel and Matías try, with the help of their union, to get their recently seized horse back, Marcelo and Alicia are trying to get a vehicle of their own so they can return the workhorse they have borrowed. Having been cast out to the outskirts of Montevideo, we get to meet these endearing people in the privacy of their own homes and through their daily struggles. They gracefully get through bearing a very unfavorable reality, with great optimism and perseverance.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ydn3V3LQrTXp75v3NxVyqMCNqKf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2017-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"By the Yoke","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2359737,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sofía Betarte","original_name":"Sofía Betarte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d27c7bdcaab6d6658970abb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":1336,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ydn3V3LQrTXp75v3NxVyqMCNqKf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"Sala Zitarrosa","release_date":"2017-07-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
