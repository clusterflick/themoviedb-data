A Colorado native, he grew up in the largely homogenous community of Boulder, which prides itself on being a bastion of cultural diversity, but which is honestly just weird. With a strong Mexican heritage, his mom and dad were the biggest influences in his life. Growing up, he always wanted to be a police officer, a dream that he realized in 1998.  His experiences as a cop are the foundation for his comedy; you just canâ€™t make some of this stuff up.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/GyyQEjciua4wu17Y7k5UzXMNcX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vinnie Montez: Armed & Hilarious","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/GyyQEjciua4wu17Y7k5UzXMNcX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
