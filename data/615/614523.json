He becomes very successful with her help, and to avoid the talk that surrounds their relationship, she suggests that he marry Mary Virginia Lee, a Southern girl from an aristocratic but impoverished family. Mary is happy to wed Emerson since she is tired of being poor. On their honeymoon, she reveals that she got married only to have luxuries, and Emerson admits that he was looking for social standing. After their confessions, they decide it's best to lead separate lives. Emerson stays at his club in New York, while Mary lives at his country home. Eleanor becomes jealous of Mary's position, even though she's the one who spends her time with Emerson.","popularity":0.2515,"poster_path":"/2C4gjzbOGDG7QgReHJYaWuDOClh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":120608,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Picture Theatres","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1920-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just a Wife","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Stewart","original_name":"Roy Stewart","popularity":0.1387,"profile_path":"/v1HJumGFhSIduYPwAK0PhuF5ihs.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Richard Emerson","credit_id":"5d263adec86b3a2c03201e40","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leatrice Joy","original_name":"Leatrice Joy","popularity":0.1136,"profile_path":"/mUrizNrPg9AfitR1kQLQnKdxEAT.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mary Virginia Lee","credit_id":"5d263ae4a698cf0f59a6ad81","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Van Antwerp","original_name":"Albert Van Antwerp","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Robert Lee","credit_id":"5d263af137b3a94f3f528c26","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1064961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathlyn Williams","original_name":"Kathlyn Williams","popularity":0.096,"profile_path":"/j8BcTXV2h98p04pYjRLtEe9LHvV.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Eleanor Lathrop","credit_id":"5d263af8c86b3a000f207630","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1420284,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Lion West","original_name":"William Lion West","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Tom Marvin","credit_id":"5d263afe37b3a949275458b5","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1796902,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eugene Walter","original_name":"Eugene Walter","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605f5d58a39d0b005412dad6","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2358896,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Katherine S.
