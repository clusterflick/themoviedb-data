The documentary follows its subjects for nearly two years, and over that time it becomes clear how mass tourism has marked these families' lives. Through their eyes, we see mass tourism's real impact on Barcelona's old city, the part of town that draws the largest number of tourists, but also the neighbourhood most steeped in history, culture, tradition and charm. Viewers will find it easy to connect with the stories recounted in the film, and they might even personally identify with one or more of them. The documentary is an appeal to empathy and a plea for reflection, and it reveals like never before the human face of a problem that is not only social, but also economic and political, an issue that affects a number of other \"fashionable\" cities like Madrid, Venice, Amsterdam, Lisbon, Rome, Prague and Paris.","popularity":0.1254,"poster_path":"/zk7183BUsAlscWEbubJbIhePNCm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10071,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bausan Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2019-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"City for sale","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2359752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Álvarez Soler","original_name":"Laura Álvarez","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d27cf8a5f6c4916bc5ec6a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2359752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Álvarez Soler","original_name":"Laura Álvarez","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d27cfabbe4b361ac49edb01","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1521343,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Laia Manresa","original_name":"Laia Manresa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/n01pXHnTC1JberI9uEH38iC0Aon.jpg","credit_id":"5d27cfc9be4b3612f49eff04","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2359753,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Cristhian Bonet","original_name":"Cristhian Bonet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d27cffebe4b3612f49eff76","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2359754,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jordi Fernández","original_name":"Jordi Fernández","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d27d019caab6d6659970b76","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8316160","wikidata_id":"Q99586612","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zGCtw3mrLp1d5GPiRbA170HYMTW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1057,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zk7183BUsAlscWEbubJbIhePNCm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ca","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
