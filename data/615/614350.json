Every year more than 1 million children die because they do not have access to clean drinking water. In Pandan, a rural village on the Panay Island, many people were suffering from kidney disease because they did not have access to clean drinking water. The project was started with the aim to solve this problem by building a 10 kilometre pipeline. Asuka (Tsuji Miyu), a college student, joins the project without giving it much thought when asked by a friend. After she arrives she quickly realizes things are worse than she expected. The labor is intense because they have no funds and the local people are hostile toward the Japanese. But amid the hardship, a five year old girl called Amy (Miel Espinoza) welcomes her kindly. The two become good friends through a picture book and Origami.","popularity":0.2931,"poster_path":"/efrPkN55y0hiGSIlZz6y8NYQQbd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tears of Malumpati","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1435904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miyuu Tsuji","original_name":"辻美優","popularity":0.08,"profile_path":"/gW8o8fVajOQtc5b7QAbnG7bR2bF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5d253ee369d28054b7005cfa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hidekazu Akai","original_name":"赤井英和","popularity":0.6281,"profile_path":"/iyOWLfVdRu73vxwwf51lj0G0Evy.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5d253f416d4c97721474c1ce","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1208617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bong Cabrera","original_name":"Bong Cabrera","popularity":0.1166,"profile_path":"/aMGVPhLbrnUuCVS6Ht1w8oKzW2z.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5d253f62a698cf0010aae616","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1129370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sue Prado","original_name":"Sue Prado","popularity":0.4527,"profile_path":"/sbU1OXO7mKIHG6QSz7XvRxc2pLH.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5d253f6ba698cf0fa7a7e821","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1909721,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miel Espinoza","original_name":"Miel Espinoza","popularity":0.0671,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5d253f76a698cf0010aae62f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1147232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ermie Concepcion","original_name":"Ermie Concepcion","popularity":0.1209,"profile_path":"/gaEPt3aDbSwzdZDrkXxHVpRotaI.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5d253f826d4c97721474c33e","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2358292,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Keita Meguro","original_name":"Keita Meguro","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d253f01a698cf3087a707a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2358292,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Keita Meguro","original_name":"Keita Meguro","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d253f1ea698cf0010aae51d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10592720","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":"sekamizu2019"},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nbDdHf7AP3nBYGAMWFyOpF7qGi3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/efrPkN55y0hiGSIlZz6y8NYQQbd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":707},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xqgifsjJPNOjzDGPa2UPcyPgTfs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":708},{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":2184,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1Acac5lkTtJLoTu6K3TLez5LoVN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1536}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2019-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
