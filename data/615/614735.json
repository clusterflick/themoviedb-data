Leyner Palacios survived, but 28 of his family members did not. When peace between the government and the FARC was signed in 2016, after 50 years of conflict, Leyner made it his mission to ensure the peace deal was implemented to his people’s benefit, receiving a Nobel Peace Prize in the process. But, as the FARC demobilise, other armed groups seek to fill the power vacuum, and political pressure through presidential elections puts Leyner’s work, and life, at risk. Will this poster boy of peace be able to protect his family from another wave of violence?","popularity":0.1351,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1898,"logo_path":"/8ix6SGlJiyuUDxLBtY8E0PY2G7w.png","name":"Fís Éireann/Screen Ireland","origin_country":"IE"},{"id":11667,"logo_path":"/dhBJdstAolGmqRfbQfElhsU1cTo.png","name":"Northern Ireland Screen","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":102483,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kew Media Group","origin_country":""},{"id":80995,"logo_path":"/awknjEFU2v2qRKAOe1MZkaMDYN2.png","name":"Fine Point Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"To bring peace to the living, you must remember the dead.","title":"Bojayá: Caught in the Crossfire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1851595,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Oisin Kearney","original_name":"Oisin Kearney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d2792c5be4b3612f59e67b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2359640,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Loretta van der Horst","original_name":"Loretta van der Horst","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d2792d85f6c4965105cd36d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1438060,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Trevor Birney","original_name":"Trevor Birney","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d2795679c24fc0010a36cee","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1613124,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brendan Byrne","original_name":"Brendan Byrne","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d27957f5f6c4965105cd95d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"14A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"'Hot Docs' Festival Screening.","release_date":"2019-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Hot Docs 2019 Trailers: BOJAYÁ: CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE","key":"dImO8E6z98Q","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-04-25T18:30:13.000Z","id":"5d2792fb9c24fc0010a3666c"}]}}}
