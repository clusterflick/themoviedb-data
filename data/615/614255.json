Octavia Lowden (LaPlante) has virtually become a drudge in order to support her sponging relatives -- flapper sister Eloise (Lucille Ricksen), hypochondriac Aunt Minnie (Lydia Yeamans Titus), and storytelling Uncle Eph (James O. Barrows). Only Octavia's frail grandmother (Jennie Lee) really needs help. When Octavia's sweetheart, photographer Pritchett Spence (T. Roy Barnes), discovers the toll these bloodsuckers are exacting, he plots with the family doctor to rescue her.","popularity":0.4548,"poster_path":"/p5ZEUHP79yxUHiQesthJiJLtIIW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1924-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Young Ideas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":43843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura La Plante","original_name":"Laura La Plante","popularity":0.1616,"profile_path":"/oiathkwBPkrBNX5jdwiE4GQlVDn.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Octavia Lowden","credit_id":"5d24cbab293835000ffadb9a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"T.
