Bill, who is engaged to Helen, Dykeman's daughter, routs the gang when they try to dispossess settlers and subsequently eludes a large posse. Later, when Hawley steals a gold shipment, Bill captures him and returns the gold to the Blue Ridge settlers; he is then accused of the robbery, but again he escapes. Disguised as a Spaniard, Bill meets Hawley and discovers him to be his father's murderer; a fight ensues, and Hawley recovers the map and kidnaps Helen in a stagecoach. Bill gives chase, overpowers the villain, and rescues Helen from the burning stagecoach.","popularity":0.181,"poster_path":"/viVX9VndmYBmykuOWIZ81nbxDde.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":165163,"logo_path":null,"name":"Myron Selznick","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1927-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Arizona Whirlwind","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1172773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Cody","original_name":"Bill Cody","popularity":0.0852,"profile_path":"/lHXckDgI44PxhXjz8KpH8lrKFLc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Bill Farley","credit_id":"5d264402a698cf0f59a6c456","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2358904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Hampton","original_name":"Margaret Hampton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Helen Dykeman","credit_id":"5d26440e6c84d60011c74063","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Dunbar","original_name":"David Dunbar","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Bert Hawley","credit_id":"5d26441569d28024d0063353","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1091491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hughie Mack","original_name":"Hughie Mack","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/qSIspcIVazqgoYY38cjaguQRvDK.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Gonzales","credit_id":"5d26441c37b3a9747d5486eb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1182922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clark Comstock","original_name":"Clark Comstock","popularity":0.0747,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5d26442369d2804fb10010ca","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":88772,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carl Krusada","original_name":"Carl Krusada","popularity":0.1278,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d2643ee37b3a94f06529e03","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1281084,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William James Craft","original_name":"William James Craft","popularity":0.0935,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d2643e137b3a9747d54867e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1483617,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Arthur Reeves","original_name":"Arthur Reeves","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d2643f969d2804fb100105e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0017640","wikidata_id":"Q62277379","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5Zl4XY18lD920caW5fOtAEk5lsa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/viVX9VndmYBmykuOWIZ81nbxDde.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1927-03-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
