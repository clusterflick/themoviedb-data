She is a good student, very strict with herself and she is always on time. She also takes care of her two younger brothers; since her mother Vera died, she’s felt responsible for the family and now she takes care of the household with her father. One morning — rushing to school to help her math teacher print exams — she is struck by a large truck and she dies. In the hereafter she finds her mother waiting for her. It's a strange feeling of both happiness and sadness. She discovers that there is a way back to life, but will she succeed in taking her mother with her?","popularity":0.4371,"poster_path":"/rbw8ACPQqg5h9VGtPCWKXXkiOny.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2198,"logo_path":"/tZg8STCa16jqauMgUGhKbybC5dN.png","name":"Pupkin","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2019-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Afterlife","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"Afterlife","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Afterlife","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2237444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sanaa
