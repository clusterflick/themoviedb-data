The filmmaker follows the development of this unusually inclusive project through its diverse protagonists, including hydrobiologists, fishermen, farmers, engineers and concerned citizens. Their divergent concerns permit a fuller and unbiased understanding of the complexity of such a project. As a result, this engaging and lyrical film is a journey that prompts a universal questioning of our past and future relationship with nature and territory.","popularity":0.1724,"poster_path":"/2Ha880dR1sDYtnjlTt69dhzypU1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6052,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aardvark Films","origin_country":""},{"id":91765,"logo_path":null,"name":"GoldenEggProduction","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2017-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The River's Bed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2236206,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mélanie Pitteloud","original_name":"Mélanie Pitteloud","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5b06840e0a263823632665","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7392174","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/khewzKBqUFvT7Ewowzq6VzPsXyA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1137},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/2Ha880dR1sDYtnjlTt69dhzypU1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1067}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":254,"name":"france"},{"id":1261,"name":"river"},{"id":1223,"name":"switzerland"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2017-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
