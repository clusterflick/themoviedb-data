The film goes on to document civil disobedience same-sex marriages and demonstrations across New York State, the Nyack Ten legal suit against New York state and the first day of legal same-sex marriages in Boston Massachusetts in May 2004. \"One Summer in New Paltz\", probes into the debate on same-sex marriage examining the intersection of same-sex marriage, war, the Constitution, race and the family. A strong work about grass roots organizing, straight/gay alliances and confrontation with state repression.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/tSTTTeoKkBKAAIJOwV3W1VQr2R1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Summer in New Paltz: A Cautionary Tale","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1968185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nancy Nicol","original_name":"Nancy Nicol","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5bbfb30e0a2624f7647ff9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1329416","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tSTTTeoKkBKAAIJOwV3W1VQr2R1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
