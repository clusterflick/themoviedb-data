It was shot in the wilderness of British Columbia and Alberta in stunning HD. Wildlife filmmaker Leon Lorenz always travels alone, often carrying a 70 pound pack for his mountain trips in pursuit of rare and exciting animal behaviours.\r Wild actions of moose and mule deer in the rut were captures, but none as wild as a charging sow grizzly and her two year old cub.
