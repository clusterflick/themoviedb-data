It is a poetic essay in repoliticising one of the most universal colours, which also has colonial references. Objects and documents are rendered in words by the Afro-American poet Kain, voiced in music improvised by drummer Lander Gyselinck and animated in images by Vincent Meessen. Ultramarine is composed like a spectrum: it unfolds and intertwines fragments of meaning.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/dQ4XoIOn0kWIRKV2jQhtoXT4rUf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ultramarine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1685547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Meessen","original_name":"Vincent Meessen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f30f5148dbc330041b11566","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1326,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dQ4XoIOn0kWIRKV2jQhtoXT4rUf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":884}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
