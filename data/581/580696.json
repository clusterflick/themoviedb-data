The film is both the story of two men falling in love with each other on a beach, and a faithful document to the filmmaking process.  In the film within a film titled \"Gay Couple Trying to Connect on the Beach\", the documentary footage of director Hiroyuki Oki will be double and triple transcribed.  The documentary film explores the relationship between the director and the world, as well as interviews with friends.  Soon the director realizes that \"kokoro\" is not what is inside of him, but the feeling that arises when confronted with something.","popularity":0.2673,"poster_path":"/A0G1z0S6uVvVN1N5KDhrzGniXFQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114521,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rikako Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1999-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inside the Mind","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Inside of Mind","type":"Alternate English title listed on the director's CV"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Inside the Mind","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Kokoro no naka","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Kokoro no uchi","type":"alternative romanization"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"心の中　Ｉｎｓｉｄｅ　Ｍｉｎｄ","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2237245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kimihiko Abe","original_name":"Kimihiko Abe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5c5cbfdd0e0a261de566f8d7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2237246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Itsuhaku Kawamura","original_name":"Itsuhaku Kawamura","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5c5cbfed9251413389bb0176","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1537148,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiroyuki Oki","original_name":"大木裕之","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":"/8rSmr1f9qtQnhgs3JUoNem2ujjI.jpg","credit_id":"5c5cb53bc3a3683cdb8add08","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2237199,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rie Uchihara","original_name":"Rie Uchihara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5cb58c0e0a2624f7662f91","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2237207,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hirofumi Aoki","original_name":"Hirofumi Aoki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5cb6d60e0a261de166daa2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1537148,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiroyuki Oki","original_name":"大木裕之","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":"/8rSmr1f9qtQnhgs3JUoNem2ujjI.jpg","credit_id":"5c5cb547c3a3683cd58a9e10","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2237200,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richie Beirach","original_name":"Richie Beirach","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5cb5c10e0a261deb66e65e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1537148,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiroyuki Oki","original_name":"大木裕之","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":"/8rSmr1f9qtQnhgs3JUoNem2ujjI.jpg","credit_id":"5c5cb697c3a3683cd58aa033","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1461671,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mal Waldron","original_name":"Mal Waldron","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5cbf09c3a3684c2389bd49","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2237202,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kazumasa Takezaki","original_name":"Kazumasa Takezaki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5cb6440e0a261de566eeed","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1537148,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiroyuki Oki","original_name":"大木裕之","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":"/8rSmr1f9qtQnhgs3JUoNem2ujjI.jpg","credit_id":"5c5cb5a692514150c2ba24f8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0131452","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":785,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8leu0QwcrujXChZQwcEC4pN087M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1395}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.638,"height":906,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/A0G1z0S6uVvVN1N5KDhrzGniXFQ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":578},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":795,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/5d5jELZy2OCAwqc2pvEtDwJgvu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":258533,"name":"gay theme"},{"id":289844,"name":"boys' love (bl)"},{"id":328767,"name":"gay pink film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"VIFF","release_date":"2008-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"The film was screened in 1998 at the Vancouver International Film Festival in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada however the official theatrical release came in 1999.
