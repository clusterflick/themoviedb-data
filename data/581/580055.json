For it became epic in just about every sense of the word: the film is very long; it tells a multi-layered story characterised as much by its digressions as by its main narrative thread, which concerns a filmmaker’s attempts to make sense of the life of Thorkild Hansen, a Danish traveller/historian/writer internationally probably best known for his non-fiction novel Processen mod Hamsun (1978); and it took a long time to finish – and then sat on a shelf due to legal battles galore.  What is now finally revealed is a monument of modern(ist) cinema: a work that as much charts one man’s journey into his soul as a voyage of discovery into another artist’s mind.","popularity":0.1977,"poster_path":"/iT5F45XFOcH7GEVadExMbipvefU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94782,"logo_path":null,"name":"Posthus Teatret","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2019-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":280,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gentle Pain","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":46866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ewa Fröling","original_name":"Ewa Fröling","popularity":0.3052,"profile_path":"/ktzsmlevSuDcbU6wnqM0PGFIrBw.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c58797ac3a368302887c993","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1441919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caspar Phillipson","original_name":"Caspar Phillipson","popularity":0.171,"profile_path":"/2344bWYuEN4NTL4ZVXBCxvpucN0.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5c5879860e0a263ccde5ff6e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":983929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laure Calamy","original_name":"Laure Calamy","popularity":0.532,"profile_path":"/ov3BaihlXFRTzKTc7Hs5KWskEi4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5c58799d0e0a2601d6d4bfbb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1194836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kasper Leisner","original_name":"Kasper Leisner","popularity":0.2001,"profile_path":"/2mSqjCIXNm4QRb2brY9biTVJlMa.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5c5879b70e0a26494de45150","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carsten Brandt","original_name":"Carsten Brandt","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c58794a92514116fc5a97a5","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carsten Brandt","original_name":"Carsten Brandt","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5867770e0a26185ac8cc20","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0396123","wikidata_id":"Q20495010","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.505,"height":1150,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iT5F45XFOcH7GEVadExMbipvefU.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":581},{"aspect_ratio":0.74,"height":785,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yUBvUdZ4OCriGMjF6p3bwiqNZYV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":581}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"IFFR","release_date":"2019-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
