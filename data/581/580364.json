But the town of Alitagtag isn’t a solicitous environment for a young strapping lad like this baby faced protagonist. His lazy, unemployed father is a vicious gambler who wagers on money he doesn’t have. With debts piling up, Ricardo’s father is soon dodging equally miscreant collectors and the people he owe money to. One day, during an altercation with his wife (she refuses to hand him her savings allotted for paying bills), he accidentally stabs her dead. He makes a run from the crime scene. Ricardo comes home and finds his mother (Beth Coronel) slain. While attempting to remove the knife from his mother’s chest, a neighbor enters the scene screaming, “Bakit mo pinatay ang nanay mo?” This time, it was Ricardo’s turn for a hasty skedaddle. Meanwhile, the runaway father gets runover by a speeding truck. And there goes the solitary witness of Ricardo’s innocence.","popularity":0.1042,"poster_path":"/gZHKv6EzfVX0pGRdxVJeLJMTuwL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2012-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maligalig","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1396565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dustin Jose","original_name":"Dustin Jose","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5fb145acec4552003ff8a166","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1761362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Ian","original_name":"Jeremy Ian","popularity":0.099,"profile_path":"/eEANKc1ud56oaQXPVgwTDR8LPwR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5fb145b2b6cff1003dc3cb6b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1536410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ross Uy","original_name":"Ross Uy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5fb145b712c6040042b586dc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rikrik Sabik","original_name":"Rikrik Sabik","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5fb145bd4a4bfc0042b6e6e9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3019593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beth Coronel","original_name":"Beth Coronel","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"6057f15c6bdec3005488fa13","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":201688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Allen","original_name":"Kim Allen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"6057f16722931a006a294d95","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3019596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Jeffrey Estrella","original_name":"Mark Jeffrey Estrella","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"6057f178fd4f800029700971","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3019598,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jake Galeon","original_name":"Jake Galeon","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"","credit_id":"6057f17e01e4d1005364011b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3019600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Myron Pareno","original_name":"Myron Pareno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"","credit_id":"6057f184b3e627006a016b97","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3019601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jhona Eriano","original_name":"Jhona Eriano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"","credit_id":"6057f1898c44b9003f982e50","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3019602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"AJ De Ala","original_name":"AJ De Ala","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"","credit_id":"6057f1910792e1003d62bdb3","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3019603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edmund Gayanes","original_name":"Edmund Gayanes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"","credit_id":"6057f19847c9fb002801b738","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3019604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gina Gayanes","original_name":"Gina Gayanes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"","credit_id":"6057f19d6f6a990054c91a26","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3019605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Lopez","original_name":"Jason Lopez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"","credit_id":"6057f1a488055100543e57c3","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3019606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jayson Montanes","original_name":"Jayson Montanes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":23,"character":"","credit_id":"6057f1aa8c44b900749c6b73","order":14}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1196306,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Singh Cudail","original_name":"Paul Singh Cudail","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6057f0f3ab1bc7003da80fcc","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3019581,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rey Pancho","original_name":"Rey Pancho","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6057f1035c071b007572e029","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3019581,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rey Pancho","original_name":"Rey Pancho","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6057f10d6f6a990054c918fc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3019586,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rodrigo S.
