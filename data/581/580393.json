It is a unique story that spans across half a century in China and connects the East with the West. It depicts Communist China's transformation as seen through the eyes of a Chinese gay man and people surrounding him. It seeks to explore humanity and morality; cross-cultural interaction in the rapid process of globalization; race; gender; religion and sexuality; interracial and cross-cultural prostitution; the lives and subcultures of marginal people as opposed to the mainstream society.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/9RyvZb5RBeMgIao9bMtN2zPO5Ly.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fearless from Red China","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2235967,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Huai Bao","original_name":"Huai Bao","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5a8ea00e0a2624f762b9dc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1474188","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9RyvZb5RBeMgIao9bMtN2zPO5Ly.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
