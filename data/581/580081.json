For Estonians it is like having a dragon's egg laid in your nest: you wait in fear for it to hatch. The Russians in Klooga, an abandoned Soviet Army base, are struggling to build a community with their new Estonian neighbours. Estonians would rather not give Russians citizenship, residence or jobs: they wish they would go home. But for Russians, Klooga is home.  A group of American scholars exploring ethnic reconciliation and democratic practice, led by Nobel Peace Prize nominee Vamik Volkan, offers $50,000 to any group of Estonians and Russians who can work together for a common goal. Twenty Russians and Estonians in Klooga form a committee and seize the challenge to build a better life for their children.","popularity":0.1873,"poster_path":"/o2SiFOs5Sc0qeHqag9qZ6KreB7Y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201176,"logo_path":null,"name":"Allan King Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1999-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dragon's Egg: Making Peace on the Wreckage of the Twentieth Century","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151983,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"William Brayne","original_name":"William Brayne","popularity":0.0778,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ce81e051e6ab00407ef501","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2234727,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bill Thompson","original_name":"Bill Thompson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5895800e0a26031bcb7c2f","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1243457,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rudy Buttignol","original_name":"Rudy Buttignol","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c589594c3a368302888069d","department":"Crew","job":"Commissioning Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1537722,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Hazen","original_name":"John Hazen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5894fec3a3683028880509","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Post Production Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":56017,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elizabeth Yake","original_name":"Elizabeth Yake","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5895aac3a3684246874eca","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":163190,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allan King","original_name":"Allan King","popularity":0.1128,"profile_path":"/yaxrYor7cgzejBJmBsHxpXDoVoU.jpg","credit_id":"5c58946a92514151a966c198","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":163190,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allan King","original_name":"Allan King","popularity":0.1128,"profile_path":"/yaxrYor7cgzejBJmBsHxpXDoVoU.jpg","credit_id":"5c589473c3a36826a6874594","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498513,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nick Hector","original_name":"Nick Hector","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":"/gtgBIbIU01FfEduOI0y1TRlnLN2.jpg","credit_id":"5c5894be92514157df52c7aa","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2234726,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Derek Pert","original_name":"Derek Pert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5894d20e0a2601d6d5008f","department":"Sound","job":"Location Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0220398","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o2SiFOs5Sc0qeHqag9qZ6KreB7Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"TVO \"The View From Here\"","release_date":"1999-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
