The program weaves together diverse stories - from urban and rural America, from the heartland to New England, from San Francisco to Harlem. Deeply moving and often humorous, viewers will get a glimpse of awakenings, first crushes, unlikely soul mates, intimacy and liberation. While separated by circumstance and upbringing, the film’s subjects are all united in their shared experiences of self-discovery, coming out, pride and love as well as a triumph over adversity and a true sense of belonging. Against the backdrop of historical events, each also traces their own hopes, struggles, influences and contributions towards advancements in equality and broad social change.","popularity":0.0648,"poster_path":"/vMwEAA2Zsp9cTBYCQAZJmUZNz3p.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Out in America","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1827621,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Goldberg","original_name":"Andrew Goldberg","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/7l8qIicECDnVsDrLrPkNJU7loHm.jpg","credit_id":"5c5a9f60c3a3683cd1873bc8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2186999","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vSoLCfpiy3TFnvRdRPHpJrwh8oE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vMwEAA2Zsp9cTBYCQAZJmUZNz3p.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
