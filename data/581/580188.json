The remarkable counter-tenor Cencic, who dedicates himself to the revival and performance of the music of the 18th century, demonstrates once more that Baroque singing can be both technically brilliant and at the same time modern and emotionally engaging. His enchanting staging of Arminio is the revival of the heroic story. When premiered in 1737 at Londons Covent Garden Arminio strangely received only six performances, despite being praised as a miracle and in every respect excellent and vastly pleasing by contemporaries.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/9aAyMA6YNwu9w1lMQCWwgTR4DO3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":168,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Handel: Arminio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2220631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaia Petrone","original_name":"Gaia Petrone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5c598105c3a36872908ce2ed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2233334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lauren Snouffer","original_name":"Lauren Snouffer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c5981119251410e246e2e98","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2235198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan Sancho","original_name":"Juan Sancho","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/9L7xGAdinrm34n5KzsQfgSJ2UAh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c5981180e0a260506cd3456","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2130278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pavel Kudinov","original_name":"Pavel Kudinov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5c59811fc3a36805e888b24b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2235200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Emanuel Cenčić","original_name":"Max Emanuel Cenčić","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/10ylP5jdFqf0XYovIWBdEvJgdZB.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5c598131c3a36872908ce36a","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2235201,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Petrou","original_name":"George Petrou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5981520e0a263ccde80e03","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1274,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9aAyMA6YNwu9w1lMQCWwgTR4DO3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":849}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
