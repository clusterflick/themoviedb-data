My ambition was to try and capture some of the town’s psyche and a little bit of its’ geography. To this end I was aided by the photographer Sebastian Edge, his ancient wet collodion photographic techniques, a mobile dark room and his assistant Gloria Lin. I documented the making of a series of photographs that managed to capture a sense of ‘place’. Ever alert to the spirit of ‘timesgone’ I have edited sounds and images that evoke a somewhat off-kilter reading of all things Rochellaises.\" – Andrew Kötting","popularity":0.0466,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2011-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Rochelle est une ville","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79872,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Kötting","original_name":"Andrew Kötting","popularity":0.2099,"profile_path":"/trIfQwhe7BsJpgqpTCdXsMxBtv3.jpg","credit_id":"5c5c00c80e0a261deb657e14","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1986886","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"La Rochelle Film Festival","release_date":"2011-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
