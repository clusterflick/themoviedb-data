This year all the meat comes from the most extensively-living, free-ranging animals of them all - wild game - and more specifically those that are viewed by many people as pests.The River Cottage chefs sharpen their knives in pursuit of wild boar, muntjack deer and greylag geese. Head gardener Mark Diacono and Hugh seek to make the most of their veg patch, even in the depths of winter, unearthing some Christmas favourites, as well as some heritage varieties from off the beaten path. Forager John Wright teams up with Pam 'the Jam' Corbin to make some luxury stocking fillers. And the Canteen hosts a `12 Tasters of Christmas' night, packed with ideas to create an array of canapes and little bites, perfect for that festive drinks party.","popularity":0.1899,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"River Cottage Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1220558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall","original_name":"Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall","popularity":0.1233,"profile_path":"/vksqHmCjjlp2px0H3MHgl3yXeIf.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself - Presenter","credit_id":"5c5a09da0e0a26494de7426e","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
