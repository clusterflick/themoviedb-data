Four days later, she was banned from baseball because it considered was \"too strenuous\" for women. A lot has changed since 1931. Unfortunately, the perception of women in professional baseball isn't one of them. With THROW LIKE A GIRL, we hope to finally give Jackie the recognition she deserves and show how her legacy can continue to inspire young female ballplayers today.","popularity":0.0636,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Throw Like a Girl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8712752","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
