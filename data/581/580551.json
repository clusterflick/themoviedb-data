Greeson's mother, Julie, was married four times and had children with three of her husbands, making his family a complicated web of stepsiblings and stepparents. Taylor spent the summer of 1981, when he was 12 years old, in Billings, MT, with his mother, his older brother, Charlie, and his younger sister, Amber. Joining the siblings for the trip was Charlie's best friend, Dwight, and Mike, an older teenager who was staying with Taylor and his dad as a boarder. What Taylor's mother and siblings didn't know was that he'd fallen in love with Mike, and had lost his virginity to the young man a few days before they left for Montana. As Taylor was dealing with the excitement and confusion of first love and coming to terms with his sexuality, the Greeson family was hit with the shocking news that Charlie had been murdered.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/xWGTzrr24pxPNl86SEBHydFgj8a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meadowlark","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2236652,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taylor Greeson","original_name":"Taylor Greeson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5bba6fc3a3683cd588ffd4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1248980","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xWGTzrr24pxPNl86SEBHydFgj8a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
