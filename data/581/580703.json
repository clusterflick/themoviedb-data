Produced by 311 and Wayne Price (Heartworn Highways Revisited), edited by Brandon “B Love” Hardin and mixed in 5.1 surround by Emmy-winner Tom Paul (Paul Simon’s Under African Skies),  Enlarged To Show Detail 3 (ETSD3) was designed to illustrate and solidify the indelible relationship between 311 and their fans.  In addition to live footage, ETSD3 features equally as much off-stage moments, including poignant interviews with band members and their fans,  behind-the-scenes clips, and revealing footage from the road, the studio and the musician’s homes.","popularity":0.0588,"poster_path":"/1Pafm2yESkQwU8I6HyeXTYVGgwY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"311 Enlarged to Show Detail 3","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":587101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Hexum","original_name":"Nick Hexum","popularity":0.0784,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65153beb9b8616013a238139","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9799960","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":1436,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1Pafm2yESkQwU8I6HyeXTYVGgwY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1079}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
