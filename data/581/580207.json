In fact, Dylan Kerchner, a local from York, Pennsylvania, built one himself. Tiny homes are currently banned from being livable in the county due to the minimum habitable space list is less than 700 sq. ft. Luckily, right next to York County lies Lancaster County, which welcomes tiny homes into its county. In part of this, Abby Hobson and Ryan met and created a tiny house community Tiny Estates in Elizabethown (located in Lancaster County). Tiny Estates has been open since April 2018 and is the largest tiny house community in the nation with 28 tiny homes on wheels and can hold up to 100. “The market is telling us that this is only going to increase.” mentions Marcus Stoltzfus, co-owner of Liberation Tiny Homes, a builder of tiny houses in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The business of tiny homes is growing along with the love for living a simpler life. “Home is where the heart is.” - Pliny the Elders.","popularity":0.4751,"poster_path":"/zZz6iAHwqc2VQks0TijtrqsdyaC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Turned Tiny: The Business of Tiny Homes","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2235305,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abby Hobson","original_name":"Abby Hobson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5c59a5e5c3a3687199890d25","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2235306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan","original_name":"Ryan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5c59a5eec3a3680b578c4920","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2235307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dylan Kerchner","original_name":"Dylan Kerchner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5c59a5f9c3a36826a6895371","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2235308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcus Stoltzfus","original_name":"Marcus Stoltzfus","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5c59a607c3a36830288a1b99","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2235309,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"David Linthicum","original_name":"David Linthicum","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c59a660c3a368478ca604d6","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2155976,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Brosey","original_name":"Matt Brosey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/oBAQ1QkNVKkyWG0wAvZQce9VZtf.jpg","credit_id":"5c59a6400e0a2601d6d71d41","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2155976,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Brosey","original_name":"Matt Brosey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/oBAQ1QkNVKkyWG0wAvZQce9VZtf.jpg","credit_id":"5c59a620c3a36826a68953c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2155976,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Brosey","original_name":"Matt Brosey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/oBAQ1QkNVKkyWG0wAvZQce9VZtf.jpg","credit_id":"5c59a638c3a36830288a1baf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2155976,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Brosey","original_name":"Matt Brosey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/oBAQ1QkNVKkyWG0wAvZQce9VZtf.jpg","credit_id":"5c59a651c3a3680b578c49ea","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2235309,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"David Linthicum","original_name":"David Linthicum","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c59a67692514135b0541978","department":"Crew","job":"Drone Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2155976,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Brosey","original_name":"Matt Brosey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/oBAQ1QkNVKkyWG0wAvZQce9VZtf.jpg","credit_id":"5c59a62fc3a36826a68953df","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2235310,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Samer Bilalic","original_name":"Samer Bilalic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c59a6ae0e0a26567ace1452","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1473,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zZz6iAHwqc2VQks0TijtrqsdyaC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1040}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":198967,"name":"tiny home"},{"id":251603,"name":"tiny house movement"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Pitt Film Fest","release_date":"2019-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Point Park University Documentary Showcase","release_date":"2019-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Turned Tiny: The Business of Tiny Homes (OFFICIAL TRAILER)","key":"gYrxNELV5W4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-05-08T17:19:02.000Z","id":"5cd313f4c3a3680b70dd4542"}]}}}
