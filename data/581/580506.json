The dream of restoring the countryside to the way it was during the first independence is only now seen by most as naïve and unreal. Six episodes that reflect the historical development in the nation parallel to the fate of the director’s mother are used to explore the effects of political order on everyday lives. Though she is now leaving the countryside, the process of moving her life provides a visual stimulus for memories.","popularity":0.0899,"poster_path":"/olQfCyk0tLPxHBjciJrBCXmGmdA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85171,"logo_path":"/1O7e8sk2hazDqDdK59ZehQHQQ7g.png","name":"Ego Media","origin_country":"LV"},{"id":143449,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bivrost Film & TV","origin_country":"NO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2008-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Mother's Farm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2236403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilze Burkovska-Jacobsen","original_name":"Ilze Burkovska-Jacobsen","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/66For2aIHxXL9T4f8l17LkSMC2v.jpg","credit_id":"5c5b573fc3a3683ccf88928b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2236403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilze Burkovska-Jacobsen","original_name":"Ilze Burkovska-Jacobsen","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/66For2aIHxXL9T4f8l17LkSMC2v.jpg","credit_id":"5fe664fb5be00e003da2e036","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2001340,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Trond Jacobsen","original_name":"Trond Jacobsen","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe6652f489d00003d97ea64","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2001340,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Trond Jacobsen","original_name":"Trond Jacobsen","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe6653e72d855003bc65a19","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2236403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilze Burkovska-Jacobsen","original_name":"Ilze Burkovska-Jacobsen","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/66For2aIHxXL9T4f8l17LkSMC2v.jpg","credit_id":"5fe664f01d6c5f003fdfeff8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2333857,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Viktors Grībermans","original_name":"Viktors Grībermans","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe6656c66565a003ed6c19b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2909933,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Harijs Beķeris","original_name":"Harijs Beķeris","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe66581e4c9eb003e79da46","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1733549,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guntis Trekteris","original_name":"Guntis Trekteris","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe665c270309f003e842738","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2909934,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rasa Belova","original_name":"Rasa Belova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe66598c7176d003f76ece7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2236403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilze Burkovska-Jacobsen","original_name":"Ilze Burkovska-Jacobsen","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/66For2aIHxXL9T4f8l17LkSMC2v.jpg","credit_id":"5fe665055be00e003ea410f4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2001340,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Trond Jacobsen","original_name":"Trond Jacobsen","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe6651d967cc7003dbac990","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2856968,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Agris Birzulis","original_name":"Agris Birzulis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe6655770309f003f85177f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1619701,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Halstein Larsen","original_name":"Halstein Larsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe665ad160e73003facbbb8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2566742","wikidata_id":"Q11989532","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.656,"height":1016,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/olQfCyk0tLPxHBjciJrBCXmGmdA.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":666},{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gLQIkCxiTBi6SGhdmNXbAaY4LTW.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":627}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
