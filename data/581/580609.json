Strange pictures and sounds are received from outer space, they show us the bizarre life on one of the moons of Saturn. In a self-designed setting, several characters: a king, a queen, torturers, gladiators and bush women. They speak an unintelligible language (Lingala) and are dressed up grotesquely, painted Ensorian style. The soundtrack for Saturnus was made using fucked up sound sculptures, heavy tape machines, non stop sax outburst and African poetry and was released in 2005 as part of the Ultra Eczema LP Music from Films by Ludo Mich. One of the leading roles is played by Nicole Van Goethem (1941-2000), Oscar Winner for her animation film Een Griekse Tragedie in 1986.","popularity":0.0368,"poster_path":"/9FIDvd1mrpIJuOwuhspfcALRJ3Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Saturnus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1791809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ludo Mich","original_name":"Ludo Mich","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5c28f4c3a3683cd589914e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.6,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9FIDvd1mrpIJuOwuhspfcALRJ3Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1152}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Ludo Mich - Saturnus (film, 1971)","key":"GLp7gt43zcE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","published_at":"2012-01-30T20:53:53.000Z","official":false,"id":"5c5c28c60e0a261deb65bb4e"}]}}}
