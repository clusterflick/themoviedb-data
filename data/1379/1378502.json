The program powerfully conveys an experience of mental confusion and frustration rooted in social contradictions. Soon her own thoughts are tormenting her as conflict and anger surface in some disturbing and antisocial behavior. Conversations and confrontations spill over into one another; voices become distorted and insights emerge in fragments as the protagonist moves through a series of unsatisfying encounters in her daily routine. She’d like to ‘find a new approach’ in the midst of this personal moral crisis, but can’t decide if she should go out West or kill her father. — WGBH","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spitting Glass","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81537,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ed Bowes","original_name":"Ed Bowes","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671f0fa15d0de89042d98b2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
