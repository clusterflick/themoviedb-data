It's at this time that 18 monks would begin their journey by hitching a ride aboard the Spanish Armada to seek the \"Woman of the Woods\" and a new life in a \"new world\". Patronized by Dr Christopher Witt, the first Botanist in the colonies and the influential Rittenhouse family on the Wissahickon River near modern day Germantown, Pennsylvania, the monks would go on into seclusion and soon make a last stand for all humankind. This film is a series of vignettes.","popularity":0.1056,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":243157,"logo_path":null,"name":"MBN Studios","origin_country":""},{"id":243158,"logo_path":null,"name":"The media Bureau","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Amidst the chaos of the 100 year colonization of the New World, rises the Order of the Quest.","title":"Order of the Quest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1160753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Conway","original_name":"Andrew Conway","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Magister Zimmerman","credit_id":"671fa7e2b3d5cbb842f4a386","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168192,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Schoolly D","original_name":"Schoolly D","popularity":0.2201,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Nagas King","credit_id":"671fa80a2685cb6563c155aa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4554288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Difonzo","original_name":"James Difonzo","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Dr. Christopher Witt","credit_id":"671fa833427c5c19f0267744","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":111692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannah Fierman","original_name":"Hannah Fierman","popularity":0.2906,"profile_path":"/uxirz12ObedQWAXFcehjggNcqBI.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Baroness","credit_id":"671fa841e833d92ef060a89a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3659128,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bernand Glincosky","original_name":"Bernand Glincosky","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Brother Kelpius","credit_id":"671fa8782685cb6563c155e7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2188604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ally Iseman","original_name":"Ally Iseman","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Nagas Queen Mara Lilatou","credit_id":"671fa89ac7802cc5035a8bb1","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5240525,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamin F.
