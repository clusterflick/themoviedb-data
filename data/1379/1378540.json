Between 2018 and 2023, the director came across different regions and places in this country, either alone or with a group of artists and eco-activists. The footage was shot on the fringes of these groups’ work and activities, reflecting and revealing themes such as nature conservation, ethnography, agriculture or actions against gentrification. The rhythm of Pedras Instáveis is determined by the Bolex camera, but it is slower and contemplative, aligning with the contemporary idea of slowing down.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/ui6tBvGYv5hKOeCFX0xZRH4Cxei.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2024-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unstable Rocks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1723043,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ewelina Rosinska","original_name":"Ewelina Rosinska","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671f1f466d6b705dc871e356","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4473298,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nuno Barroso","original_name":"Nuno Barroso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676b95ead3c6149522a9e333","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1723043,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ewelina Rosinska","original_name":"Ewelina Rosinska","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676b95fcd3c6149522a9e338","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4473298,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nuno Barroso","original_name":"Nuno Barroso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676b9607d3c6149522a9e33c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ui6tBvGYv5hKOeCFX0xZRH4Cxei.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Doclisboa","release_date":"2024-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
