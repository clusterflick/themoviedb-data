A courageous takatāpui (Māori LGBTQI) activist is fighting for true diversity in our Gay Pride celebrations.  Director Kathleen Winter says of the film: “It's basically trying to give a different view of the LGBQT community and the way we celebrate pride. It is trying to do that by introducing us to takatāpui, which is a Māori word that is being reclaimed and used as a blanket term for Māori who are LGBQT in many different ways. It's mainly about my friend Kassie who identifies with takatāpui, and she – along with a lot of people – feel alienated with our pride celebrations.” Stuff.co.nz","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"He Kākano Ahau From The Spaces In Between","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
