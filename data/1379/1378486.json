Tom is receiving transcripts of his innermost thoughts in anonymous letters. Sexual ambiguity, symbiotic relationships, and self-identity are all at play here. Structured in long, uncut takes with beautiful camera work by Tom Bowes, the real-time aesthetic of the work is the result of the script, in which much of the action takes place in drifting conversations. — Marita Sturken, “Television Fictions: An Interview with Ed Bowes,” AFTERIMAGE (May 1986)","popularity":0.1141,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Romance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81537,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ed Bowes","original_name":"Ed Bowes","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Tom","credit_id":"671f0a08fefd1e0510009ca3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4358280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karen Achenbach","original_name":"Karen Achenbach","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Tommy","credit_id":"671f0a28c7802cc5035a7c1c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4358312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Cannon","original_name":"Elizabeth Cannon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Kathleen","credit_id":"671f0a68fefd1e0510009cab","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81537,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ed Bowes","original_name":"Ed Bowes","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671f09c8e833d92ef0609486","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
