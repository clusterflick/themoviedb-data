Born on the island of Tinos in the mid-19th century, he met with massive acclaim at a young age, spent years in a psychiatric hospital, and was artistically reborn in the twilight of his life, a little before the outbreak of the Second World War. Thanks to their long history of marble cutting and carving, the Halepas family have left an indelible mark on the island, which is also home to a School of Fine Arts.","popularity":0.0704,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"the life and work of yanoulis halepas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5026074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zina Papadopoulou","original_name":"Zina Papadopoulou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671e7cee27bd57d91f630820","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
