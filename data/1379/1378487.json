Crime and punishment. This obvious division persists until – after several years – the boy comes to the conclusion that justice has not been served and decides to take matters into his own hands. Then the roles reverse. The film tells the story of life before and after the tragedy; it shows who the heroes of this tragedy are today and what consequences they have faced for their actions. It's a film about a situation that changes entire life.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Entangled","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1344785,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lidia Duda","original_name":"Lidia Duda","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671f0a33c7802cc5035a7c22","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
