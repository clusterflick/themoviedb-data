Created by Enos Pegler for the Zealandia Living Picture Company, the film is a re-enactment – most likely of a speech Yates gave to the local council. Lacking sufficient lighting technology, many early films were filmed outdoors on a set made to look like it’s inside. This film is no exception – look closely and you will see the ‘walls’ are blowing in the breeze.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1900-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The World's First Lady Mayor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1900-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Restoration of First Lady Mayor film","key":"Ik3TPtHiUnU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-11-02T19:44:01.000Z","id":"671fe48127bd57d91f633a74"}]}}}
