From the climate of the Red Zone to the police charges on the procession of 21 July, to the situation around the body of Carlo Giuliani in Piazza Alimonda. The shooting is a selection of images shot by Giacomo Verde and other independent video makers connected to different groups. The videoâ€™s intention is to tell what the media fail to show because they are trapped in the rules of communication-show and scoop. So many episodes are commented by texts of \"militant poetry\" in order to provide reflective ideas that go beyond the contingency of facts, and others use images \"effected\" (rallenty, velocity etc.) and an original sound commentary in order to go beyond the documentary data still present. A video that wants to be an instrument of emotional and political reflection, for the various components of the anti-g8 movement, on the different issues raised by the days of Genoa.","popularity":0.1818,"poster_path":"/mZbsFh7aPyofxDes4IY7JfKbQty.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":243102,"logo_path":null,"name":"ShaKe Edizioni
