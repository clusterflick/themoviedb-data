She engages in clashes of opinion with people who believe in the positions propagated by bloggers like Vidlák. The plurality of opinion has been transformed by their influence into a battlefield divided into good and bad media. This confrontational portrait of the role of a liberal periodical in the era of rampant social media conspiracies with a sociological overlay discusses the impossibility of dialogue. It asks questions about the difference between opinion and fact, as well as what authority is respected by those who oppose authority and who is the watchdog of democracy.","popularity":0.086,"poster_path":"/88nx2FctFyHfZDOTfoOq8APij3Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2024-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"},{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pit Stop Reporter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3261701,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zora Čápová","original_name":"Zora Čápová","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671f4b30e833d92ef0609de5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4696058,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jakub Vacík","original_name":"Jakub Vacík","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6724a6ba90004810fecb26df","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2465115,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kryštof Hlůže","original_name":"Kryštof Hlůže","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6724a6c38d19261406615d70","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5034608,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Barbora Marková","original_name":"Barbora Marková","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6724a6d112d1a073a38d7ab1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2289645,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Adam Levý","original_name":"Adam Levý","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6724a6de8d19261406615d77","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2693903,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jan Mesany","original_name":"Jan Mesany","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6724a6f0f08ab5d3f203891e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":"Q130680840","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":882,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/At4QmOx4RDN3t2aztu0QUY474Ja.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1568}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dTtkWq8XwnU3ecqsXRWv8sn2H5V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"cs","file_path":"/88nx2FctFyHfZDOTfoOq8APij3Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":534}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ji.hlava International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
