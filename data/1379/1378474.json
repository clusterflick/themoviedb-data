Often called \"the cradle of civilisation\", the first urban settlers grew up on the lands between the two ancient waterways. But today, things are dramatically different, for the rivers and the people who depend on them. Iraq's ancient rivers and water resources have been seriously damaged by wars, economic sanctions, the construction of upstream dams, pollution and a fall in water levels. The Tigris and Euphrates meet in Basra province, in the south of Iraq, where they form the Shatt al-Arab waterway. Tens of thousands of Iraqis live in marshes.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/4uxde3q5gbMC13OUnzsUCTEmuLn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"}],"release_date":"2019-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Iraq's Dying Rivers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5026775,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Omayma Naklah","original_name":"Omayma Naklah","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671eff2b9ff681d9e0a4893c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5026776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mohammad Rahahleh","original_name":"Mohammad Rahahleh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671eff3a769107d77b483455","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4uxde3q5gbMC13OUnzsUCTEmuLn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"QA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
