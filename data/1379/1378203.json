Over ten years of commutes are condensed in dozens of shots of railway tracks, each set to diferent pieces of music ranging from Eduard Artemyev to Kraftwerk. In line with Hills’ decades-spanning investigations of rhythm in film, the mundane Vienna-Prague line is transformed through rapid montage into a musical reverie of geometries in motion; a joyous, personal rif on that cinematic motif par excellence: the train.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":"/1q1rDcH9QZFk6Jxm9VkhB0KOxJP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Commute","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1113695,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henry Hills","original_name":"Henry Hills","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/iZiYZwSxVB7Ic3xBdl2mOCG1F2W.jpg","credit_id":"671e71b627bd57d91f63025d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1q1rDcH9QZFk6Jxm9VkhB0KOxJP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"2024 Vienna International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"The 49th Hong Kong International Film Festival","release_date":"2025-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"The 49th Hong Kong International Film Festival","release_date":"2025-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
