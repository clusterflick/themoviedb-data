But the expedition to places where frost and ice reign supreme was no mere adventure. The film adaptation by director Vladimír Šimek gives the viewer a glimpse into the authentic atmosphere of these wild places, to experience the stunning, yet so fragile beauty that goes beyond the simple human imagination. In addition to educating and entertaining, the film crew has prepared for its viewers an extraordinary aesthetic experience that shows us in a non-violent way how vulnerable our planet is if we do not change our emissions policy.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2024-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sailing for Ice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4499646,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimír Šimek","original_name":"Vladimír Šimek","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671ff4ca5d0de89042d9a991","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
