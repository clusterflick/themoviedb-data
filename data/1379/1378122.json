If one were to piece together a synopsis, it seems as if Storm P is given the task – by secret order – to draw the penguins in the Zoo. Using real penguins as models, he draws his well-known cartoon character Ping from the ‘Peter and Ping’, and the drawing is subsequently delivered to the person who commissioned it via a messenger dog.
