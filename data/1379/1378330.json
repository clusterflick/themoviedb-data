The bourgeoisie are represented by a masked married couple who have tethered their child to the balcony of their apartment. To the irritation of the parents, the child repeatedly throws a ball down into the street, and the father has to retrieve it again and again. At the end of the film the artists, now positioned on the stairs of the Academy, are all wearing masks and badges with what look like convict numbers. People in the streets begin to uncover the pistols under their coattails. The “Art Brut” music for the film was made by Asger Jorn and Jean Dubuffet and is played on toy instruments. Jean-Luc Godard wanted the film shown before screenings of La Chinoise (1967), but the request was vetoed by Debord.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/hLhuY2QPi37DEgCEh5EhQ76vQ4J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1961-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"So Ein Ding Muss ich Auch Haben","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Albert Mertz","original_name":"Albert Mertz","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671e9c874be15469e70e30c4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2309911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asger Jorn","original_name":"Asger Jorn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671e9cbd5d0de89042d97810","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2471873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Dubuffet","original_name":"Jean Dubuffet","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671e9cc74542e371fe0af8d2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hLhuY2QPi37DEgCEh5EhQ76vQ4J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1961-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
