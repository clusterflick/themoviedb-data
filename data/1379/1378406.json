The process was mainly observed in the mind-wandering state not unrelated to the daydreaming stimulus of a transient condition.  The use of both aggressive and transcendent images brings the viewer to a dream outside of time, exaggerated by a high rate of movement, unrelated moods focused on various names of otherworldly phenomenon. This has been coupled with sound projections culminating in a rhythmic trance music which can induce an altered state of consciousness that allows communications with spirits and induce dreamlike states.  This is part vi from the series, Dreams.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/fOcdbD1pXO3tOV7A0dMrBnQJYgH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dream Evocation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Swiezynski","original_name":"Matthew Swiezynski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671ed743e833d92ef0608fe4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Swiezynski","original_name":"Matthew Swiezynski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671ed75bfefd1e0510009647","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Swiezynski","original_name":"Matthew Swiezynski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671ed7676d6b705dc871de84","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Swiezynski","original_name":"Matthew Swiezynski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671ed776a4ac8a432c5cbaf3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fOcdbD1pXO3tOV7A0dMrBnQJYgH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
