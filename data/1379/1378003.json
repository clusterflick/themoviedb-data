It turns into a chain of unexpected farewells: her mom dies of cancer, her lover flees army conscription, everything including her own old self is falling apart. Her way to cope with the grief is to fixate everything with her camera. Her anger guides her to inner emigration to the local underground scene, which became an escape for young russians. This kaleidoscope of shards chronicles not only spirit of the time, but the director’s personality crumbling against the backdrop of global turmoil.","popularity":0.2471,"poster_path":"/k3wh6Fjr1FrF3v02XpPkiR3KkRU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106819,"logo_path":"/pOHOEVPOBTAgOtSa3iIQEWT9xfj.png","name":"Independent Film Project","origin_country":"GE"},{"id":236792,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eversince","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2024-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Shards","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Oskolky","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2457229,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariya Chernaya","original_name":"Mariya Chernaya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"671ef4311ea33928297da8dd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2457229,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariya Chernaya","original_name":"Mariya Chernaya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671ef439a4ac8a432c5cbeee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34191290","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4Iz9NazmO0JYLtF2AVTHTPTW2Nq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2819,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/k3wh6Fjr1FrF3v02XpPkiR3KkRU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1994}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"22º Doclisboa | Competição Internacional | The Shards  | Masha Chernaya","key":"HGUcaM5t400","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-10-10T10:21:35.000Z","id":"671ea5c034c0fabd681d082e"}]}}}
