Following the assassination of a German attaché in Paris, which is wrongfully labelled a “Jewish terrorist attack” by Nazi propaganda, the people turn on the perceived “enemy within” and violently descend on Jewish neighbourhoods and places of worship. As the city spirals into chaos and dozens of innocent people are murdered, orders are handed down to “let the people riot.” Krützfeld is faced with the moral choice between upholding the system or taking a stand.","popularity":0.442,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":6692,"logo_path":"/2Wd2CodKtgB4XyAQH4ez8qnZuqg.png","name":"Benaroya Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":608,"logo_path":"/dD2Do4GHXAql5c4LjXCbEOvxbFg.png","name":"Dor Film","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":243818,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinelaunch","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Kristallnacht","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clive Owen","original_name":"Clive Owen","popularity":2.538,"profile_path":"/xlWpuLgwxMnZEVgV9OID1TkUNtP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lieutenant Krützfeld","credit_id":"671fac3c427c5c19f0267897","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Pettyfer","original_name":"Alex Pettyfer","popularity":1.5233,"profile_path":"/jcejkad2OWB71Bz1RRc4Ib0961k.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Kai Lehmann","credit_id":"6729136f47311eb8990b78a2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Markovics","original_name":"Karl Markovics","popularity":0.2505,"profile_path":"/gQrQLzFze9rPz40kkr1RWuqLAJN.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Isaac Roth","credit_id":"6729137c47311eb8990b78b4","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15115,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stefan Ruzowitzky","original_name":"Stefan Ruzowitzky","popularity":0.1323,"profile_path":"/38AgCYbF46HIoKHPVKGRwOVnInH.jpg","credit_id":"671fac5a427c5c19f02678c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15115,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stefan Ruzowitzky","original_name":"Stefan Ruzowitzky","popularity":0.1323,"profile_path":"/38AgCYbF46HIoKHPVKGRwOVnInH.jpg","credit_id":"671fac6334c0fabd681d2824","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3453675,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Julius Grützke","original_name":"Julius Grützke","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671fac6d34c0fabd681d282b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937171,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Benaroya","original_name":"Michael Benaroya","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671fac89427c5c19f02678f7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14616,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Danny Krausz","original_name":"Danny Krausz","popularity":0.0603,"profile_path":"/waa0nFnolZPQVgpxED5fTHJzLMR.jpg","credit_id":"671faca2427c5c19f0267909","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1694434,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marcelo Gandola","original_name":"Marcelo Gandola","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671facac427c5c19f026790e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22386,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel Zuta","original_name":"Daniel Zuta","popularity":0.048,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671facb6427c5c19f026792a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486025,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ben Sachs","original_name":"Ben Sachs","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671faccbfefd1e051000a82d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2453322,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Seth Renshaw","original_name":"Seth Renshaw","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671facd45d0de89042d99a06","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2453175,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gregory McLachlan","original_name":"Gregory McLachlan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671facde5d0de89042d99a0d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1838755,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Florian Krügel","original_name":"Florian Krügel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671facf4427c5c19f026794b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3838290,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris K.
