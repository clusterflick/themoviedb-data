The documentary is structured as a travelogue through the Czech Republic with stops and documentary situations, supplemented by testimonies of local people, well-known personalities of design, architecture, experts on social geography and history. Each place will have its own theme that defines the situation of Czech taste (the role of tradition, money, the state of crafts, the role of chains with their unified products).","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2024-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Road to Disfantasy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1378261,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Dušek","original_name":"Martin Dušek","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671ff71d769107d77b486191","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
