The children were asked questions about what they would consider when choosing their life partners. Their statements reflected both individual dreams and the values passed on by their parents. “While making this film with children, I came up with the idea of shooting a continuation of this game for adults. (…) I found it interesting to ask them years later the same questions they answered as children and compare their views on the same topic when they become adults. (…) I wanted to return to my film characters at the moment when little six-year-old Ewa, who played the role of the bride, would be getting married – Jadwiga Żukowska explains the film's implementation assumptions.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Playing Adults Continue","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3255524,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jadwiga Żukowska","original_name":"Jadwiga Zukowska","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671f0e349ff681d9e0a48cae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
