She finds him intriguing and is amused by his antics, but desperately tries to suppress him whenever she fears that her mom will see him. This reaches its climax when Jackie is caught wearing a shirt and tie after being encouraged by Jack. Jackie and her mother share a tense moment at dinner, but when her mother tries to reach out, Jackie flees. She tries on the dress to appease her mother despite her own discomfort, but her mother rectifies this by showing her the shirt and tie that Jackie would be more comfortable wearing. With this reached understanding, the mom reaches out and offers her support. Together they cut Jack's hair in the bathroom, and the mom kisses the top of her sonâ€™s head.","popularity":0.0356,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"mirror, mirror","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5026006,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grayson Bellingham","original_name":"Grayson Bellingham","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671e74edc7802cc5035a6d28","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
