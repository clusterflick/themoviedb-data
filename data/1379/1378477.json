Twenty-two years ago Piotr Szczepański decided to make a film about a group of his friends every ten years, creating a unique generation portrait. These friends were the punk rock band Cool Kids of Death. The first part of the saga was the 2004 awarded documentary “C.K.O.D. Generation”. Twenty years after its foundation and ten years after disbanding, Cool Kids of Death starts a special tour of concerts now having a cult status.
