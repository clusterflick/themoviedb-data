A personal collection of books, letters, photographs, postcards, posters and signs are represented throughout the work. The title “grapheme” is derived from a linguistic term referring to the smallest unit, or letter, of the written language. In this piece, the written word and representational images are simplified to an ambiguous visual motif through extreme close-ups, a fast-paced rhythm and dynamic motion. The nature of seeing and reading is questioned by the sequence of images, letters and words. Underscoring the video is an original soundtrack composed with a musical collaborator, Daniel Brlas. In this moving-image work, visual language is interrogated as a fragile source of meaning.","popularity":0.0361,"poster_path":"/tWgHo1h41eZMhksVJrQWhfsVrld.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grapheme","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5026097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Brlas","original_name":"Daniel Brlas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671e80d8fefd1e0510008146","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4324899,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rennie Taylor","original_name":"Rennie Taylor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/yXikmMWkEYHx1ataUIyvX2KJ9Kf.jpg","credit_id":"671e80e74be15469e70e2a5d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tWgHo1h41eZMhksVJrQWhfsVrld.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gXWsXacRw1wbgq8ONHszfCFa7mi.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":287803,"name":"experimental cinema"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Grapheme (2021)","key":"721255934","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2022-06-16T23:41:06.000Z","id":"671e7f85e833d92ef06082b4"}]}}}
