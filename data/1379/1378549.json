Iran’s Ministry of Art and Culture used additional material to create a seven-minute short film intended as a postscript in veneration of both the filmmaker and the Pahlavi regime’s vision of progress. It was a last gasp, released at the dawn of the Iranian Revolution which would see the ultimate downfall of the Pahlavi regime. A decelerated rendition of this short film accompanies an audio interview with an archivist entrusted with preserving the original reels.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2024-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Postscript","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1537465,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Parastoo Anoushahpour","original_name":"Parastoo Anoushahpour","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/dZWyy4XKOZ2slKfddeF3rveKC8Y.jpg","credit_id":"671f2a1c5be9e8759da7b1ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1537464,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Faraz Anoushahpour","original_name":"Faraz Anoushahpour","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/pE8g8w8jKGf7mlXDdQp7VGHocLA.jpg","credit_id":"671f2a24769107d77b483960","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1537466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Ferko","original_name":"Ryan Ferko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/uFJsY1I7HAqFTFKAVCXD0lqdJ6K.jpg","credit_id":"671f2a29769107d77b483964","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
