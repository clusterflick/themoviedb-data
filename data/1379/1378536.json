The film moves through route 3199 in the Negev desert in southern Israel/colonised Palestine—a route followed and filmed by renowned filmmaker Chantal Akerman around her untimely death in 2015. A work invested in an attempt to mourn Akerman in a time of ravaging genocide that creates an inter-generational trauma. A reckoning with the blind spot of European Jewry towards the settler colonisation of Palestine by Zionism and the ongoing Nakba.","popularity":0.0732,"poster_path":"/qIOFaEkMdX6mKxXblWhHmKYxkg3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2024-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"[anan]","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2230422,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sirah Foighel Brutmann","original_name":"Sirah Foighel Brutmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671f1ce334c0fabd681d16c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2230423,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eitan Efrat","original_name":"Eitan Efrat","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671f1ce9e833d92ef060982c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1460,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qIOFaEkMdX6mKxXblWhHmKYxkg3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":972}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Doclisboa","release_date":"2024-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
