The characters create an architecture that promotes the commune in itself, promotes people to participate in its creation, to participate in its evolution and to participate in its functioning, thus participating in their association with each other. The animation presented, describes a day in the revitalized commune, and how it continues to evolve spatially and chronologically.","popularity":0.0347,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"metecho: an architectural narrative at a medieval ruin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5026047,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evangelia Moschou","original_name":"Evangelia Moschou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671e7a054be15469e70e28ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5026048,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Effrosyni Varsami","original_name":"Maria Effrosyni Varsami","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671e7a0d27bd57d91f630718","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5026047,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evangelia Moschou","original_name":"Evangelia Moschou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671e7a1eb3d5cbb842f47f5b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
