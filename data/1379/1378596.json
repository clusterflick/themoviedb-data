This documentary about the preparation of a production based on the principle of theatre on the stage uses filmic means to explore the meaning of the art of theatre and, in the civilian conversations among members of the ensemble outside their roles, reveals that even the actors themselves often grope for the meaning of their profession. In the process, the sometimes humorous and sometimes critical moments during the preparation of a theatrical piece reveal the many pitfalls of collective work in contemporary society.","popularity":0.0664,"poster_path":"/gKIvRCieMKDjInP9xmVlsOmKsHv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":133292,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinepoint","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2024-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I, Actor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2143490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Řezáč","original_name":"Ivan Řezáč","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/rC91Ks13jAxJ3wniiWGJ003MSva.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"672493d012d1a073a38d7807","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1629727,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Ryšavý","original_name":"Martin Ryšavý","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671f4a955be9e8759da7b71e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2543587,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alice Tabery","original_name":"Alice Tabery","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6724939fc1c7433ebbc425fa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1629727,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Ryšavý","original_name":"Martin Ryšavý","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672493a712d1a073a38d77fb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1162347,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anna Ryndová","original_name":"Anna Ryndová","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672493afc1c7433ebbc42607","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2290725,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michaela Patríková","original_name":"Michaela Patríková","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672493bdc1c7433ebbc42613","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":"Q130739703","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9tVzjHUKZXDtjC2ur2s4aVlcKqz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gKIvRCieMKDjInP9xmVlsOmKsHv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ji.hlava International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
