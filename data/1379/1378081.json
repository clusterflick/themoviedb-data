Short explains that Kovacs' work was \"simple and innocent\" on the surface, but featured a \"grim\" darker side that pleased his audience, including a memorable sketch in which his opera critic character used a shotgun to express his annoyance with a soprano's performance. He did most of his own writing and created a series of unique characters of various nationalities and professions, including a Prussian DJ and a bumbling magician. He played upon his experience as a second-generation immigrant, born to Hungarian parents, and his most famous characters included Miklos Molnar, a Hungarian cooking show host, and Leena, Queen of the Jungle. A pair of gag glasses helped Kovacs to create Percy Dovetails, a lisping poetry enthusiast of dubious talent.","popularity":0.0466,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":236216,"logo_path":null,"name":"Comedy Partners","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kovacs Mystique","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
