They live in the Tibetan Buddhist village of Tia in a remote valley in Ladakh. Smanla is not only a healer, but also a farmer and this film shows how he combines these activities during the intensive harvest months. Very often the Amchi is the only person the villagers can turn to for medical or mental help. He also gives advice on important community matters. The Amchi's way of treatment and diagnosis is based on Tibetan medicine. Most important is the questioning, the feeling of the pulse and the observation of the tongue and eyes.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Those Who Care: Faith and Healing in a Ladakhi Village","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5025657,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henriette Lavaulx-Vrécourt","original_name":"Henriette Lavaulx-Vrécourt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671e55c9e833d92ef0607b51","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Whitworth Art Gallery","release_date":"2002-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
