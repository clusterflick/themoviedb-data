In his painting work, shaped by the postmodernism of the 1980s, he leans towards abstract abbreviation and symbolic depiction of reality through everyday objects. The film is a snapshot of his life filled with painting, working in his garden and cohabitation with his partner. The civilian camera follows Merta as he prepares an exhibition for which he attempts to create new works. However, his engagement with the current geopolitical situation enters into the work, as well as the discovery of new compositional principles and creative otherworldliness that co-create his enchanted personal world.","popularity":0.1676,"poster_path":"/wUPAorM36A1cclejDTYZfqyDeTq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122386,"logo_path":"/2Ys4TLVInarrtbciCuTJcjzviGZ.png","name":"Cinémotif
