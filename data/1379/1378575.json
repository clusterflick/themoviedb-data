Influenced by this discovery, the director sets out to trace her male family lineage, whom the end of World War II brought to Argentina. Instead of a clarification, however, the past crumbles and disintegrates into a mosaic of archival material, family films, excerpts from personal diaries and fragments of the works of Roberto Rossellini or Luchino Visconti. But it is the meanings that emerge from the combination of disparate images that offer answers and fill the information vacuum that has shaped generations of the family. The dynamics of the Bonino family's male-female relationships have a much darker basis than the social context of the time. In the story of grandfather, father, cousins and sons, Toia also finds a story of identity and of the role of wives, mothers, grandmothers and daughters in a history shaped by men.","popularity":0.0389,"poster_path":"/4j84sGf4lpQcmmCy5Nt0jjXtWo6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":258314,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alita Cine","origin_country":""},{"id":127536,"logo_path":"/uagIeESZ9umbdJMxVEwpRxgnJos.png","name":"Mostra Cine","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2024-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Goodbye","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1815659,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Toia Bonino","original_name":"Toia Bonino","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671f3f61e833d92ef0609c69","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1815659,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Toia Bonino","original_name":"Toia Bonino","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ede1a115f6ba86f1e17b06","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1815659,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Toia Bonino","original_name":"Toia Bonino","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ede1a6cf06190cbae17c73","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1917018,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolás Testoni","original_name":"Nicolás Testoni","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ede1b4cf06190cbae17c76","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1739371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gustavo Galuppo","original_name":"Gustavo Galuppo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ede1c64909e25b07a7914f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1739371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gustavo Galuppo","original_name":"Gustavo Galuppo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ede1cb4680f26bf3a7964d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2545676,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Armin Marchesini Weihmuller","original_name":"Armin Marchesini Weihmuller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ede1d4cf06190cbae17c7a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2163074,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mercedes Gaviria","original_name":"Mercedes Gaviria","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":"/FIwmtAp055VVrOuGcpUfjSaxeO.jpg","credit_id":"67ede1dd5f3bd7242e6290ba","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3998650,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Santiago Pedroncini","original_name":"Santiago Pedroncini","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/31aPhXUTVkrvTVUCNzY2ceZJ2Qo.jpg","credit_id":"67ede1ea5f3bd7242e6290c0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1364,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4j84sGf4lpQcmmCy5Nt0jjXtWo6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":909}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BAFICI","release_date":"2025-04-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ji.hlava International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
