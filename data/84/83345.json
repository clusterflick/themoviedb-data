Luis, Maria's fifteen-year-old grandson, doesn't say very much either; he shuts himself off in his own silent world to escape his parent's marital crisis, spending time instead picking up stray cats and dogs off the street.

flat.","popularity":0.6882,"poster_path":"/iJn1337MVElQA7LRLEHHoOLBavn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1247,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eddie
