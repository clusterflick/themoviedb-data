We have heard that Iran is a nuclear menace in defiance of the international community, bent on \"wiping Israel off the map\", supporting terrorism, and unwilling to negotiate. This documentary disputes these claims as they are presented to us and puts them in the context of present and historical US imperialism and hypocrisy with respect to Iran. It looks at the struggle for democracy inside Iran, the consequences of the current escalation and the potential US and/or Israeli attack, and suggests some alternatives to consider.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/227X0M0JUPLAmEKVNm052EKEnn3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Will truth be the first casualty of our next war?","title":"Iran Is Not the Problem","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":929809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonia Juhasz","original_name":"Antonia Juhasz","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1002,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe48aa9251416c9109454f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":929810,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Everest","original_name":"Larry Everest","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe48aa9251416c91094553","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":929811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Gould","original_name":"Robert Gould","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1004,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe48aa9251416c91094557","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":929812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Veiluva","original_name":"Michael Veiluva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1005,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe48aa9251416c9109455b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":929813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mitchell Plitnick","original_name":"Mitchell Plitnick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1006,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe48aa9251416c9109455f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":929814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Haber","original_name":"Jim Haber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1007,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe48aa9251416c91094563","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":929815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Majid Baradar","original_name":"Majid Baradar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1008,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe48aa9251416c91094567","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":929816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Glick","original_name":"David Glick","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1009,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe48aa9251416c9109456b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":929817,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sahar Driver","original_name":"Sahar Driver","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1010,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"52fe48aa9251416c9109456f","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":929807,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aaron Newman","original_name":"Aaron Newman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48aa9251416c91094545","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":929808,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Aaron Newman","original_name":"Aaron Newman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48aa9251416c9109454b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1378702","wikidata_id":"Q19880618","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/227X0M0JUPLAmEKVNm052EKEnn3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-07-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer","key":"Gwvfz1-RXbo","published_at":"2008-04-20T18:14:05.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6cfc3a3685448007807"}]}}}
