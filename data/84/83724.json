Beth Holloway (Tracy Pollan) is still trying to find out what happened to her daughter when the already strange case takes another turn when Joran Van Der Sloot (Stephen Amell) is arrested for murdering another girl. If you've followed this case like I have then there's not going to be any new twists or turns in this film but then again that was pretty much true for the first one. I was a little surprised to see how well-made this thing was and there's no question that it's a better movie than the 2009 one but at the same time there are a few too many flaws to really call this a good picture.","popularity":2.7219,"poster_path":"/iRCv2AOdJawGHQNvUjGlBe62lEm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8899,"logo_path":null,"name":"PeaceOut Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":58055,"logo_path":null,"name":"Frank von Zerneck Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Justice for Natalee Holloway","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":177443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tracy Pollan","original_name":"Tracy Pollan","popularity":0.5496,"profile_path":"/kMsIHlRNlSw9DxKELWPRkm1D6RI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Beth Holloway","credit_id":"52fe48b89251416c91096161","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Amell","original_name":"Stephen Amell","popularity":1.4354,"profile_path":"/iyYZeOsJkE7D8Wsamv6NML9WlL8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Joran Van Der Sloot","credit_id":"52fe48b89251416c91096165","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83721,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Cohen","original_name":"Scott Cohen","popularity":0.9447,"profile_path":"/xzm9EQQ4R62V2z2I2UagOuYGa9Y.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"John Q.
