What began as a weekly escape from the daily grind of work and family responsibilities, gradually evolved into a more serious commitment. Inspired by classical Esther Williams techniques from the 1950s, this group of train drivers and meat buyers, archivists and teachers soon became passionate exponents of the sport.","popularity":0.7245,"poster_path":"/rmqwMfdab7d2v7FfUXFDo3Ot5gu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17643,"logo_path":null,"name":"Met Film
