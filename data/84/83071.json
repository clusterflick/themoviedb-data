Taxi driver Khaled picks up a woman and baby. Her face is hidden behind a blue burka. They settle on a price, she pays him and they drive off. The taxi arrives at its destination. The woman gets out and a new passenger climbs in... to find the baby still in the backseat. Khaled leaps out after the woman but she's vanished. He's left holding the baby - a 6-month-old boy. Who is the mother? How can he find her? He asks friends and strangers in the street. He returns to where he picked her up. Nothing. Fate has handed him a young life for which he feels more and more responsible. An eventful, chaotic, often highly comic journey through a city which is itself simply trying to survive. Poignant, rich, vibrant, Barmak Akram's debut feature is a remarkable portrait of one man's emotional awakening in a city returning to crazy life after 25 years of violent conflict.","popularity":0.2134,"poster_path":"/qcFYpb42vAzedFXyA7PkX1xm0W9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73590,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Auteurs Associés","origin_country":""},{"id":2927,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fidélité Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":58747,"logo_path":"/j9a22Ud3RVxbT8mLXQQJJH3CRdW.png","name":"4 A 4 Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AF","name":"Afghanistan"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2009-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kabuli Kid","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Kabuli Kid","type":"split from original title"},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"幸福招呼站","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1073337,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valéry Schatz","original_name":"Valéry Schatz","popularity":0.1095,"profile_path":"/cXwGMcWomo414mstTb8NsMii3Wu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Matthieu","credit_id":"5447958ac3a3686d960021f4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1073338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amélie Glenn","original_name":"Amélie Glenn","popularity":0.2447,"profile_path":"/wuva2dCMepkzbX8q90k2P60XpRR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Marie","credit_id":"544795a0c3a3686d89002147","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1376504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chafi Sahel","original_name":"Chafi Sahel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Baba","credit_id":"544795b6c3a3686e91001e13","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1099047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Haji Gul Aser","original_name":"Haji Gul Aser","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Khaled","credit_id":"54479637c3a3686d8f00220c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1636185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohammad Chafi Sahel","original_name":"Mohammad Chafi Sahel","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Baba","credit_id":"5760e2bb92514175c4000445","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1636186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leena Alam","original_name":"Leena Alam","popularity":0.0863,"profile_path":"/12823FkVyDQOGuLiG01Eno4JQRl.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Femme de Khaled (as Helena Alam)","credit_id":"5760e32192514175bf000492","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1636210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Messi Gul","original_name":"Messi Gul","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Bébé abandonné","credit_id":"5760f25592514175c8000807","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1349338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mustafa Haidari","original_name":"Mustafa Haidari","popularity":0.1957,"profile_path":"/ya9C139lPT5rOBLWSi1PVa9Ian3.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Radio Journalist","credit_id":"5760f2fbc3a36808ae000880","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4402,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marc Missonnier","original_name":"Marc Missonnier","popularity":0.0839,"profile_path":"/UaCT6P1VcDlzjpjYLKRAFTp93b.jpg","credit_id":"5447972f0e0a2672d7002269","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4401,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Olivier Delbosc","original_name":"Olivier Delbosc","popularity":0.2497,"profile_path":"/dOvtk3HBqFn7NHp1DDOUEfJtoGJ.jpg","credit_id":"54479700c3a3686d84002320","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1073344,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Barmak Akram","original_name":"Barmak Akram","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"544796c00e0a2672dd0021eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1073344,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Barmak Akram","original_name":"Barmak Akram","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"544796d00e0a2672eb0021db","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1217635","wikidata_id":"Q3202983","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.693,"height":955,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qcFYpb42vAzedFXyA7PkX1xm0W9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":662}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
