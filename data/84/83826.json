But that s not the only thing that makes Pingo unique. He also happens to be raised by a most unlikely duo, Lou and Buddy, two birds of prey who initially set out to make a meal out of Pingo and end up taking him in as their own. Pingos toe tapping skills not only catch the eye of a darling young female penguin, Bella, but they could be the key to stopping the vile hermit crab, Gabby, and his dimwitted sea lion sidekick, Thrasher, from destroying a colony of penguins that are home to Pingos long lost parents.","popularity":0.813,"poster_path":"/8L4hZUkAbLvV47dwKsQim8XTjaR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19540,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gaiam Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":4422,"logo_path":"/1XUBlFEBEVM6gnv8vJ8BfQ879z8.png","name":"Renegade Animation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"He's just winging it!","title":"Tappy Toes","video":false,"vote_average":2.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":194804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katie Leigh","original_name":"Katie Leigh","popularity":0.4195,"profile_path":"/jApn1mOWTxQG6a8a3IJmgjRaxqH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Pingo (voice)","credit_id":"5df9407e7f2d4a0013979d47","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Zieff","original_name":"Rick Zieff","popularity":0.272,"profile_path":"/t52zVWnyrcIPIlBOdRhlaVEyNuH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator / Buddy / Thrasher (voice)","credit_id":"5df9408c7f2d4a0015977edd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2484911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cap Action","original_name":"Cap Action","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Lou / Jonesy / Chuck (voice)","credit_id":"5df940926476540015531ea7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":556498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Lollar","original_name":"Phil Lollar","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Gabby / Ozzie (voice)","credit_id":"5f9c79f49ee0ef00387ef2e5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1241729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deborah Sale Butler","original_name":"Deborah Sale Butler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/rcRjvJBwnCqU0Ri0k3Ebj9NBCoO.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bella / Gerty (voice)","credit_id":"5df940b4be2d490012512013","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94177,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darrell Van Citters","original_name":"Darrell Van Citters","popularity":0.2824,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a537b1058224012ffdf2bc","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70183,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert Zappia","original_name":"Robert Zappia","popularity":0.2812,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df940cd6476540018531bc6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94177,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darrell Van Citters","original_name":"Darrell Van Citters","popularity":0.2824,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df940c3be2d49001451302c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1274807,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peggy Regan","original_name":"Peggy Regan","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":"/foriHjBeUonRebESVLKEQIUfH0L.jpg","credit_id":"5df940d8609750001530da9a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4270880","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3LaIur4gPZl4GjnXgY2lUhW2eZY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8L4hZUkAbLvV47dwKsQim8XTjaR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
