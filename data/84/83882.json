It’s also the only place left for the forsaken inhabitants of the surrounding tower blocks to meet, a shelter where they can get together and exchange.\r This documentary film takes us into the everyday life of a small grocery store. As customers pass by, Ali, the charismatic shopkeeper, also part-time singer, is benevolently welcoming them.\r This moving and often amusing chronicle shows the importance of such a place, a small shop “around the corner”, in the middle of the Projects, where in spite of difficulties and poverty, people still share user-friendliness, laughter, human warmth.","popularity":0.1438,"poster_path":"/7iDxw3yrxGn1hF3XzzhN4OfGbBp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17321,"logo_path":null,"name":"Images
