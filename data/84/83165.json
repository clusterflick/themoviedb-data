Through the flicker of dim projector bulbs and the warble of optical soundtracks a blueprint for better living in the Atomic Age was spelled out in no uncertain terms. Fantoma presents this collection of religious films and Sunday School favorites. No nuns with rulers here, just good old-time cinematic religion.
