Together, they concoct a plan to ambush and do away with the Cisco Kid once and for all.","popularity":0.7057,"poster_path":"/x1XSQeLUdoi72P5UOXqAyL46B9a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1928-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The first all-talking sound-on-film feature.","title":"In Old Arizona","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":27,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Warner Baxter","original_name":"Warner Baxter","popularity":0.1207,"profile_path":"/vX605wp5rnjezGUnsTSrFse5tPy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Cisco Kid","credit_id":"52fe48cf9251416c910990ad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edmund Lowe","original_name":"Edmund Lowe","popularity":0.2451,"profile_path":"/8aDjzC5moz2NQZ8aBhBn5bmuFXj.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sergeant Mickey Dunn","credit_id":"52fe48cf9251416c910990b1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":103014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Burgess","original_name":"Dorothy Burgess","popularity":0.1476,"profile_path":"/AdrXFImsV023OE4NRshOhMHtvsN.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Tonia Maria","credit_id":"52fe48cf9251416c910990b5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Armetta","original_name":"Henry Armetta","popularity":0.2401,"profile_path":"/9Bvd4g9QaFoMtYm3VYpJeAa9R3I.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Barber (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe48cf9251416c910990b9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170218,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Bradbury Jr.","original_name":"James Bradbury Jr.","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/tMUq5bnVES00t27lmfHyI1RYn4r.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Soldier (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe48cf9251416c910990bd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Brown","original_name":"Joe Brown","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Bartender (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe48cf9251416c910990c1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Campeau","original_name":"Frank Campeau","popularity":0.1012,"profile_path":"/pi0A4lSUveDrP5exp4sSITTIQs4.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Man Chasing Cisco (uncredited)","credit_id":"5f02478ba843c10035002661","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alphonse Ethier","original_name":"Alphonse Ethier","popularity":0.1228,"profile_path":"/mzAejIPtHEb7NISo57zTLlYd8JK.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Sheriff (uncredited)","credit_id":"5f0247c331d09b0036c580f0","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1058695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Webb Dillion","original_name":"John Webb Dillion","popularity":0.0805,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Second Soldier (uncredited)","credit_id":"5f02480ad0b43400336939b0","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Farley","original_name":"Jim Farley","popularity":0.4315,"profile_path":"/155ugk9VWe00T7wWSo3pqb9b80d.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Townsman (uncredited)","credit_id":"5f02482ba843c100350026cb","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":581350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Soledad Jiménez","original_name":"Soledad Jiménez","popularity":0.125,"profile_path":"/rak2UHYk6120qJpLxSwnYlMBzKs.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Tonita the Cook (uncredited)","credit_id":"5f024864f056d50036d30254","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1015769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Linow","original_name":"Ivan Linow","popularity":0.0731,"profile_path":"/v4B4r3BmpWwbJ92ZYOmAI5Hvmnx.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Russian Immigrant (uncredited)","credit_id":"5f02488ca843c10035002706","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom London","original_name":"Tom London","popularity":0.2025,"profile_path":"/nfLW8J3AMasTu1Ahm0HftRgx9qy.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Man in Saloon (uncredited)","credit_id":"5f0248b2ebb99d00377f94c9","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":128199,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Lynch","original_name":"Helen Lynch","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":"/aB9f3liiUs2klcTgcvWJe6vZVot.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Stagecoach Passenger (uncredited)","credit_id":"5f0248cc41aac40037926619","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
