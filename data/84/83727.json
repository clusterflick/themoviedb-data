One night, she sees that the front door is slightly ajar and impulsively decides to sneak inside. But there in the dark, decrepit auditorium, a show unlike any other unfolds before her eyes. Its host is an eerie human puppet named Peg Poett who will introduce Penny to six tales of the bizarre: A couple traveling in a remote part of the French Pyrenees cross paths with a lustful witch; A paranoid lover faces the wrath of a partner who has been pushed to her limit; The Freudian dreams of an unfaithful husband blur the lines between fantasy and reality; The horrors of the real world are interpreted through the mind of a child; A woman addicted to other people's memories gets her fix through the vitreous fluid of her victims' eyeballs; And a perverse obsession with sweets turns sour for a couple in too deep.","popularity":1.6141,"poster_path":"/3gYvILcCnxczLqOMVqFwCsKcyOz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":49855,"logo_path":null,"name":"Quota Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":38474,"logo_path":"/wDtZ0YB3KOaVSNGQjoFOc20YPap.png","name":"Severin Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2011-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Welcome to the Theatre of the Absurd.","title":"The Theatre Bizarre","video":false,"vote_average":5.425,"vote_count":106,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"离奇剧院","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Udo Kier","original_name":"Udo Kier","popularity":1.106,"profile_path":"/8bD9dTPML8JZgkCzUu2tUN8byOG.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Peg Poett","credit_id":"52fe48b99251416c910962ff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":804206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Newcomb","original_name":"Virginia Newcomb","popularity":0.1368,"profile_path":"/xdin5aWu7H3SI46fFeC9lCNpwUO.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Enola Penny","credit_id":"52fe48b99251416c91096303","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":908518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Marquardt","original_name":"Amanda Marquardt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Squalid Woman","credit_id":"52fe48b99251416c91096307","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":929997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amelia M.
