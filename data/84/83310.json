Pirkle, this film warns what will happen to America if the citizens do not give up their depraved ways and turn to God and Jesus for salvation. Communist infiltrators, the \"footmen\", will pave the way for an all out invasion by weakening our will through TV, dance, rock music and alcohol. Once the invasion begins, the new Communist government will proceed to round up all Christians, and either execute them or force them to undergo re-education. Only by putting their faith in the bible where it belongs, says Rev. Pirkle, can America resist the coming Red Menace.","popularity":0.8087,"poster_path":"/k1iyfvJ5D5KwVULEZ8aSgIvMboW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39938,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Ormond Organization","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1971-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Frightening Prophecy Of A Doomed America","title":"If Footmen Tire You, What Will Horses Do?","video":false,"vote_average":3.9,"vote_count":15,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"If Footmen Tire You What Will Horses Do?","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2140098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judy Creech","original_name":"Judy Creech","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Judy","credit_id":"5bb39dfd9251410c2a003521","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1599849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cecil Scaife","original_name":"Cecil Scaife","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"The Commissar","credit_id":"5bb39e07c3a3681e1f0120f2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1599847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gene McFall","original_name":"Gene McFall","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Assisstant Commissar","credit_id":"5bb39e120e0a263e050104cb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2140099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wes Saunders","original_name":"Wes Saunders","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Comrade Teacher","credit_id":"5bb39e1d9251411cbb01045c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1910651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Estus W.
