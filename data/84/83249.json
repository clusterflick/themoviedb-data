It took two trials, two high court appeals, a petition to the Governor General and 3 years, 6 months and 1 week in prison before David finally won his freedom and was found not guilty of the crime he didn't commit. But it wouldn't have happened without the unrelenting efforts of three individuals - a journalist, a lawyer and a scientist - who put their own personal and professional lives on the line in order to prove that David Dougherty was innocent.","popularity":0.2898,"poster_path":"/bfVtAE1yc9ziHZQyHFJjaIpVIUu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50828,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lippy Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"2009-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Until Proven Innocent","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1238424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Elliott","original_name":"Peter Elliott","popularity":0.1047,"profile_path":"/jwzpgBgjSLal4CN9HhI32BgekzV.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Murray Gibson","credit_id":"566a728cc3a3682647003721","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":939388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cohen Holloway","original_name":"Cohen Holloway","popularity":0.3472,"profile_path":"/7qWqBZk4arFgx7TJpi7uXe6eH2z.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"David Dougherty","credit_id":"566a7458c3a36833b6004028","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":15580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jodie Rimmer","original_name":"Jodie Rimmer","popularity":0.145,"profile_path":"/dMAbRS0tYu5VsgcGnmGDh3x1uRF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Donna Chisholm","credit_id":"566a747c92514174110082dd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1086829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miranda Harcourt","original_name":"Miranda Harcourt","popularity":0.1756,"profile_path":"/226d9sOry0S2ZwUlBftfo5nhgsE.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dr Patricia Sullivan","credit_id":"566a74ad925141664f003bc6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1547572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Spite","original_name":"Tim Spite","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Ari Geursen","credit_id":"566a75d5c3a36833b6004070","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1358280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adele Chapman","original_name":"Adele Chapman","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":"/pbJIGFHUrBdLEORHZTxvWHEez45.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Clerk of Court Second Trial","credit_id":"5ea1372b38e510001eda628b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1232242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vanessa Stacey","original_name":"Vanessa Stacey","popularity":0.0855,"profile_path":"/g7O5whA990cgFOpdsYqa5fWEfEI.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Forewoman Second Trial","credit_id":"5ea84fa8be55b7001fe4fbb2","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451510,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Donna Malane","original_name":"Donna Malane","popularity":0.0932,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"566a75619251417383003947","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1271980,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Burger","original_name":"Peter Burger","popularity":0.0685,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"566a753cc3a36833b6004050","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1451511,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paula Boock","original_name":"Paula Boock","popularity":0.196,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"566a757f925141664f003be6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1389382","wikidata_id":"Q97291827","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bfVtAE1yc9ziHZQyHFJjaIpVIUu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":1073,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/NssrT3GZf1zMnGCF9gWW6SYMdi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":753}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":378,"name":"prison"},{"id":2658,"name":"new zealand"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
