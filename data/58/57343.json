For Mel that day has come. In junior high, Mel and Gabby (Sara Rue) were the biggest geeks. Of course, Mel had a crush on the most popular guy, Drew Hesler (Brian A. Green). When word spreads of Melâ€™s crush, he plays a cruel joke on her pretending to be interested, only to turn her down in front of the entire school.

When Mel is assigned to handle the publicity for a new restaurant, she is shocked to discover that the owner is a handsome young entrepreneur named Drew Hesler.","popularity":1.5218,"poster_path":"/54N1fl5QjkBih0AP2oKtL8No243.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Time Around","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":35,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":43903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carly Pope","original_name":"Carly Pope","popularity":0.6155,"profile_path":"/i2yFxKvqmeJElTRTaOWw6b4HRRc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Melissa 'Mel' Rochester","credit_id":"52fe492fc3a36847f818d7a1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Austin Green","original_name":"Brian Austin Green","popularity":0.6525,"profile_path":"/8KGhmSEmxwn6oJBN5NCpeYDJ2hx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Drew Hesler","credit_id":"52fe492fc3a36847f818d7a5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Rue","original_name":"Sara Rue","popularity":1.226,"profile_path":"/o11tkGyCWxi8Cmjg2q8hTVFmhK3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Gabby Castellani","credit_id":"52fe492fc3a36847f818d7a9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1184971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gina Tognoni","original_name":"Gina Tognoni","popularity":0.0674,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Cara Cabot","credit_id":"52fe492fc3a36847f818d7ad","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":43301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sherry Miller","original_name":"Sherry Miller","popularity":0.6173,"profile_path":"/8loCxWNAAF7m3C3kFAREKqO7mBc.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mary Ann McNally","credit_id":"52fe492fc3a36847f818d7b1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Lipper","original_name":"David Lipper","popularity":0.2054,"profile_path":"/apAgZr1qU5Q99RFR1xCrpZ1CUL9.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Martin","credit_id":"52fe492fc3a36847f818d7b5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":939457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Greydon Reid","original_name":"Adam Greydon Reid","popularity":0.3385,"profile_path":"/dmAWl70msENG4VfETN5WNBA6fdW.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Jeff Blue","credit_id":"52fe492fc3a36847f818d7b9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27559,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Edison","original_name":"Matthew Edison","popularity":0.2066,"profile_path":"/hYMwq4AP58Sr3YlmUeCMyFBUQdG.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Kevin","credit_id":"52fe492fc3a36847f818d7bd","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":55615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Megan Park","original_name":"Megan Park","popularity":0.8121,"profile_path":"/2tLqIOevl1UanuSNGSoCw3vM96k.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Young Cara Cabot","credit_id":"63b6e88873520500a78e698c","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1232769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Brugel","original_name":"Amanda Brugel","popularity":0.4157,"profile_path":"/3W1RR8CzP5uk6sFt92i1QyjGLRT.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Abby","credit_id":"64f5c8b1f29d66013a21ce78","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131785,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Douglas Barr","original_name":"Douglas Barr","popularity":0.5466,"profile_path":"/diqiqLjIsuSYdULyKbwTP03c9dJ.jpg","credit_id":"52fe492fc3a36847f818d79d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":169730,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Chad Hodge","original_name":"Chad Hodge","popularity":0.1076,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d20e96a97c646cb5810553","department":"Writing","job":"Teleplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71145,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eric Allaman","original_name":"Eric Allaman","popularity":0.0784,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d20ea366892bad62818924","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55642,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Derick V.
