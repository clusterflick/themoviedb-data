Chris Everard presents what can only be described as the most startling UFO footage ever seen. The Space Serpents flying around the upper atmosphere have to be seen to be believed. What's more, is that all the UFO clips come direct from NASA - filmed by astronauts aboard the Space Shuttle! I must admit that I originally thought the premise for this film was ridiculous. Two hours later, I found myself staring blankly at the end credits. My phone rang unanswered. I lit my first cigarette for 20 years and realised that some kind of Alien Invasion is happening. Colonel Philip Corso was right.
