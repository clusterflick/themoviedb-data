The 3-day competition includes everything from delicate chocolates to precarious six foot sugar sculptures and requires that the chefs have extraordinary skill, nerves of steel and luck. The film follows Jacquy Pfeiffer, founder of The French Pastry School in Chicago, as he returns to France to compete against 15 of France's leading pastry chefs. The filmmakers were given first time/exclusive access to this high-stakes drama of passion, sacrifice, disappointment and joy in the quest to have President Sarkozy declare them one of the best in France.","popularity":0.3792,"poster_path":"/orLXFuV9WGqczVBJRw1tRHF50o0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24487,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pennebaker Hegedus Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2009-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"16 Chefs, 3 Days, 1 Chance","title":"Kings of Pastry","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":22,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2095629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacquy Pfeiffer","original_name":"Jacquy Pfeiffer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b5ef3f39251415227041fac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2095630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sébastien Cannone","original_name":"Sébastien Cannone","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b5ef4040e0a262e9204603c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2095631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Beaudry","original_name":"Rachel Beaudry","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b5ef40f9251415227041fc9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2095632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Rigollot","original_name":"Philippe Rigollot","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b5ef41d9251415224042f4b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2095633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stéphane Glacier","original_name":"Stéphane Glacier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b5ef42a0e0a262e9c047d8d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2095634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Regis Lazard","original_name":"Regis Lazard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b5ef43b0e0a262e9204609f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2095635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frédérique Lazard","original_name":"Frédérique Lazard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b5ef44a0e0a262e920460ad","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2095636,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Urraca","original_name":"Philippe Urraca","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b5ef454c3a368421b04aca1","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21113,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"D.
