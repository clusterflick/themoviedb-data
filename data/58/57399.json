It is a dance about feelings, which always pose a big challenge – particularly for young people.  Teenagers from more than eleven schools in Wuppertal went on an emotional journey that lasted almost a year. Every Saturday, forty students aged between fourteen and eighteen years of age took part in rehearsals that were led by Bausch-dancers Jo-Ann Endicott and Bénédicte Billiet and intensely supervised by Pina Bausch herself.","popularity":0.1997,"poster_path":"/bHiCN8Ea29CoH9ZH7lwtiLtSLod.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1410,"logo_path":null,"name":"TAG/TRAUM
