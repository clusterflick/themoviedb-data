When Mammy is about to discover him, he hands it off to Jerry; this lets him be a hero to Mammy and still get his chicken. Jerry is miffed, and sees his chance to retaliate: Spike is very possessive of his bone. Jerry keeps stealing the bone and planting it on Tom. Finally, Jerry bores a hole in the bone, inserts a bolt, and gets Tom to swallow a magnet. The bone keeps coming back to Tom, even through a fence. Finally, as Tom runs off followed by Spike, Jerry, who's been hiding in a tin can, is also dragged along.","popularity":0.8331,"poster_path":"/pxv2X0atQFHvajT2CEbuts91Afi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89238,"logo_path":null,"name":"MGM Cartoon Studio","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1950-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Framed Cat","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":32,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Tom & Jerry: Snärjd katt","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"被陷害的猫","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":150633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Randolph","original_name":"Lillian Randolph","popularity":0.2472,"profile_path":"/k3dOsZunpup8wQcj1jKem9Oam8E.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mammy Two-Shoes","credit_id":"52fe492ac3a36847f818c6a9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daws Butler","original_name":"Daws Butler","popularity":0.4715,"profile_path":"/qxaOMbICdts0qpUmkYj3OMhDGt8.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Spike / Tom","credit_id":"60e8b62f8de0ae007e873708","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13594,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joseph Barbera","original_name":"Joseph Barbera","popularity":1.2363,"profile_path":"/16UhnbVLaX9QBtcnjLH6hrdzq4F.jpg","credit_id":"52fe492ac3a36847f818c681","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Hanna","original_name":"William Hanna","popularity":0.7365,"profile_path":"/zf5WRsouQN0ozuJ4vFosXylPjaZ.jpg","credit_id":"52fe492ac3a36847f818c687","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137486,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fred Quimby","original_name":"Fred Quimby","popularity":0.2035,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe492ac3a36847f818c68d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149095,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ed Barge","original_name":"Ed Barge","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe492ac3a36847f818c693","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149098,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Kenneth Muse","original_name":"Kenneth Muse","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe492ac3a36847f818c699","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117060,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ray Patterson","original_name":"Ray Patterson","popularity":0.1585,"profile_path":"/przzcKQJDVMVhX9ovm7bnvSNkbf.jpg","credit_id":"52fe492ac3a36847f818c69f","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149100,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Irven Spence","original_name":"Irven Spence","popularity":0.1011,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe492ac3a36847f818c6a5","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137562,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Scott Bradley","original_name":"Scott Bradley","popularity":0.155,"profile_path":"/AjQ95xfBtFc39ADKaPi1jupim2m.jpg","credit_id":"61357db2cede6900870a9420","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0042476","wikidata_id":"Q4051086","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5Qxa1AMF6UFbtqyS3INHwSFZH7s.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1087,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pxv2X0atQFHvajT2CEbuts91Afi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":724},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/fS8nn7eXzCg4d7fcjQUbW22pfe0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1950-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
