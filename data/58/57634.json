Now, nearly 60 years later, a team of experts examines the original blueprints to determine if these so-called \"Wunderwaffen,\" or \"wonder weapons,\" could have changed the outcome of the war. One of Adolf Hitler's most top secret bombs: The Fritz X grandfather of the modern smart bomb. Prototype testing revealed that the success rate with this radio-guided bomb was over 80 times higher than with conventional free-falling bombs of the time.  In every documented case the destructive power of the Fritz X proved so strong that it would completely rip through any battleship it hit. It would never explode while still inside the ship, but on exiting or in the water.","popularity":0.1691,"poster_path":"/1sZxufpMVbdN2DlHax5W2Q0zvx0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7521,"logo_path":"/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png","name":"National Geographic","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hitler's secret weapons of WW2","title":"Nazi Secret Weapons","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3080360","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/msovA7nXoV0xrCZHIr7M4Lifb3V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1sZxufpMVbdN2DlHax5W2Q0zvx0.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/j9rNCsXoAJxkmSiezywmOwwRxyX.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
