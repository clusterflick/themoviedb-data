Donald realizes that if he had some eggs, he would be quite the wealthy duck so he breaks into a nearby hen-house and collects as many eggs as possible putting them all in a huge basket. Unfortunately, a rooster standing guard makes his presence known and ejects Donald. The inventive duck is able to get back in disguised as a female chicken who the rooster falls for and dances with. Unfortunately, with the rubber glove comb constantly coming loose and a caterpillar falling down the back of his suit, he is ever at the risk of being discovered.","popularity":0.8246,"poster_path":"/AsynMGcNqaJFX7nZwv3FAA9ff3Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney
