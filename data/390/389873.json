Max, a poor sod, is drowning his existential confusion in alcohol. Julie, a young woman, finds it impossible to reconcile herself with the bitter realities of her life. But on this festive night, they’ll try to put aside their personal mess and painful pasts. Unfortunately, that past remains hot on their heels. Max’s urgent money needs drove him to commit a robbery with a trio of idiots.
