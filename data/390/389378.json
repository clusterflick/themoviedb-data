As the SAS created havoc to the railway system the Germans were hunting them down. Eventually by the use of torture and information by collaborators the Germans tracked them down to their camp near Verrieres. The majority of the SAS were killed or captured. Those captured were later murdered by the Germans.. Their actions tied up large numbers of Germans in guarding the railways and imposed a severe delay on the movements of the 2nd SS Pz Div to Normandy. A few brave men had an impact on the liberation of France out of all proportion to their numbers","popularity":0.9539,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SAS and the Normandy Campaign: Operation Bulbasket","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"SAS and the Normandy Campaign - Operation Bulbasket","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1550101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Saunders","original_name":"Tim Saunders","popularity":0.1265,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Director and Presenter","credit_id":"56f3d89fc3a3682fdb0025a9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1550098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Duff","original_name":"Andrew Duff","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Producer and Presenter","credit_id":"56f3d8b9925141769e0016e4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1552508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Dormer","original_name":"Tom Dormer","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56f3d8ccc3a3682fdd00295b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1552505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Johnson","original_name":"Andy Johnson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"56f3d8e19251411a8b002628","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2652,"name":"nazi"},{"id":1799,"name":"ss (nazi schutzstaffel)"},{"id":4299,"name":"normandy, france"},{"id":4303,"name":"waffen ss"},{"id":194435,"name":"special air service (sas)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
