Scientists over the decades have examined this priceless specimen to try and determine what made this seemingly normal man change the face of science and define the word genius. This documentary will follow the path of Einstein's physical brain and all the places it traveled, while simultaneously telling the story of Einstein the man. This special dives deep into Einstein's life, his theories, and not just what we've learned about the human brain by studying his, but what we have yet to learn.","popularity":0.2046,"poster_path":"/cnM1F0cXFWXRNv9BFIZIYUZFIKB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3507,"logo_path":"/m7iLIC5UfC2Pp60bkjXMWLFrmp6.png","name":"History","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Secrets of Einstein's Brain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"El cerebro de Einstein","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5381593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Algyer","original_name":"Harry Algyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Padre di Einstein","credit_id":"6803764eb13410cdc7993bde","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sasha Andreev","original_name":"Sasha Andreev","popularity":0.1231,"profile_path":"/3MpVjRjNcGAOgdawY7ZmLDzREtx.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Steven Levy","credit_id":"68037659e4753425efad6b9c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trace Beaulieu","original_name":"Trace Beaulieu","popularity":0.3297,"profile_path":"/2AB4g7ZSEU3Q5C5Bt6xthvOYK87.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Albert Einstein","credit_id":"68037662e4753425efad6ba7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5381594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bethany Chastain","original_name":"Bethany Chastain","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Mileva Einstein","credit_id":"6803766ce4753425efad6bb3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1697698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamara Clark","original_name":"Tamara Clark","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Insegnante","credit_id":"6803767b391b927019d92905","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3234618,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Megan Corse","original_name":"Megan Corse","popularity":0.0497,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Patient extra #3","credit_id":"68037689391b927019d9290d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2316203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cameron Cylkowski","original_name":"Cameron Cylkowski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Patient extra #4","credit_id":"6803769665c00a25a5d970c4","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1978537,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Dooley","original_name":"Sean Dooley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Young Thomas Harvey","credit_id":"680376a065c00a25a5d970c8","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1363853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Edel","original_name":"John Edel","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Einsteins Patent Office Boss","credit_id":"680376a92368b12b179940b1","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5381595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobby E.
