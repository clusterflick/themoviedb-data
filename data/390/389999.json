The young woman works at a good job, nurses her terminally ill husband, cares for her small child, and puts up with a difficult mother-in-law. Her desire to chuck it all is tempered by the need to take care of her family, and as China slowly heads toward the communist takeover in 1949, the chaos of the war around her further inhibits any impulse to go it alone.","popularity":0.1412,"poster_path":"/fp6qzD8ZQ2LvkOm0Fz5VMN8IJPr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":181834,"logo_path":null,"name":"北京电影制片厂","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"1985-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chilly Nights","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1172008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pan Hong","original_name":"Pan Hong","popularity":0.3778,"profile_path":"/9G1G3KHQRPvsq4VtwEg6EsTrFFb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64e485b806f98400eb5de88f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2972494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lin Moyu","original_name":"Lin Moyu","popularity":0.0597,"profile_path":"/nHrUa70HDnEWAnWwiyGDfcI9ak1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64e485edc613ce00eaa715fb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xu Huanshan","original_name":"许还山","popularity":0.3167,"profile_path":"/4mvdi8aLQKgib8C6Z1uxf7p1oaY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64e4861ce0ca7f00e3496577","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4228204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kun Ma","original_name":"Kun Ma","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64e4866ec3c891011d9ca03a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1722553,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jin Ba","original_name":"Jin Ba","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/s6CpCB7KHhtWh9a0AYPc4rbExPj.jpg","credit_id":"64e486a9e894a600c726afd8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3540978,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wang Chuanjun","original_name":"Wang Chuanjun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e486dc06f984012d70a47b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1597162,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Que Wen","original_name":"Que Wen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f8343e9251410c1700191b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4458202","wikidata_id":"Q124822358","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":918,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dNR9k0WsGtJDDFu6SZuhhiElB2y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1631}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1302,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fp6qzD8ZQ2LvkOm0Fz5VMN8IJPr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":930}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
