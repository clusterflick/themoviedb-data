Finally he comes in sight of Red Dog Gulch and, hungry and thirsty, he pushes on toward the city. Susie is the daughter of the town drunkard. She starts out on her horse for a little ride, and a little way from town is attacked by Pedro and Little Casino, two Mexicans, who try to steal her horse. Billy happens along, runs the Mexicans off and takes Susie back to town.","popularity":0.4333,"poster_path":"/j6U4M2HbeAjvBE2FHNHmiyFv003.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91633,"logo_path":null,"name":"King Bee Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Stranger","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy West","original_name":"Billy West","popularity":0.1211,"profile_path":"/fIqELek2UAdkPyVmDf92dngGcC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Prospector","credit_id":"56f7a31ec3a3686a5c006025","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leatrice Joy","original_name":"Leatrice Joy","popularity":0.1136,"profile_path":"/mUrizNrPg9AfitR1kQLQnKdxEAT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Susie","credit_id":"56f7a329c3a3686a67006538","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092794,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bud Ross","original_name":"Bud Ross","popularity":0.0585,"profile_path":"/mz7mUJh4dKnqgGi4dDE5ZNpc2z7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Susie's Father","credit_id":"56f7a340c3a36816e8005b32","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Hardy","original_name":"Oliver Hardy","popularity":1.0454,"profile_path":"/qRMGQo5oWwcLpwgXSoArXK5riwe.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Oliver, the saloonkeeper","credit_id":"56f7a34ec3a3686a6700653e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo White","original_name":"Leo White","popularity":0.1971,"profile_path":"/pKJDApReiE0EVmmkTYbHNW7d1Yu.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Greaser","credit_id":"56f7a35dc3a3686a6e006586","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086622,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Bordeaux","original_name":"Joe Bordeaux","popularity":0.1169,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Diner","credit_id":"5b2640f49251410d5000d736","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145513,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arvid E.
