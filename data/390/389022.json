In an accelerating storm of cynical opportunism, her sincere beliefs are exploited by businessmen, politicians and military men. Rival groups compete to exploit the hysteria the vision causes, and the chaos culminates in a revolution. Striking imagery and skillful camerawork enhance this feature.","popularity":0.1143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5175,"logo_path":"/sEc4VmMYh1G09ySm8ThZ5S3gcUS.png","name":"ICAIC","origin_country":"CU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"}],"release_date":"1971-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Days of Water","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1505391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Idalia Anreus","original_name":"Idalia Anreus","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Antonica","credit_id":"59e284079251416360005899","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1460187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raúl Pomares","original_name":"Raúl Pomares","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/8UfMVssuDxhPkMRf9b5xms79izR.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lino","credit_id":"59e28413925141635c005c82","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1128482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolfo Llauradó","original_name":"Adolfo Llauradó","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":"/yvhi55olUH8pFgbWloJlcoAaQOS.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Felipe","credit_id":"59e2841ec3a3687c600052ee","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1120035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Balmaseda","original_name":"Mario Balmaseda","popularity":0.0592,"profile_path":"/oec9fUxlYAUBsFU4CERwsPRi4ZW.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Toni","credit_id":"59e2842992514163880057f3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raúl Eguren","original_name":"Raúl Eguren","popularity":0.0551,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"59e28431c3a3687c18005b38","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1905858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Omar Valdés Teté Vergara","original_name":"Omar Valdés Teté Vergara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"59e2843a92514163b9005835","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1310442,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuel Octavio Gómez","original_name":"Manuel Octavio Gómez","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f0c3979251414b39000a5f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1477111,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bernabé Hernández","original_name":"Bernabé Hernández","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e283eb92514163b3005a1c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1310442,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuel Octavio Gómez","original_name":"Manuel Octavio Gómez","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e283e2c3a3687c370053b6","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0067032","wikidata_id":"Q7729256","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":701,"name":"cuba"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
