One pair is owned by the landlord of an apartment building and the other by one of his lodgers. The lodger also has a wallet that contains rent money except when it doesn't, and the wallet passes from one pair of trousers to the other at unexpected moments. But neither the landlord nor the owner of the wallet are the central figures here, for The Rent Jumpers is primarily a love story between the landlord's daughter, played by the ever popular Mae Busch, and the lodger's roommate, young Charley Chase.","popularity":0.2394,"poster_path":"/b1zAK5RkUpvLKwav6ZF1E52pjP6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4148,"logo_path":null,"name":"Keystone Film Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rent Jumpers","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charley Chase","original_name":"Charley Chase","popularity":0.3584,"profile_path":"/bIJBRLtjiZtrq3c9uDYn1Cl5a7J.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"A Young Boarder","credit_id":"56f767edc3a3686a590056b5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mae Busch","original_name":"Mae Busch","popularity":0.1453,"profile_path":"/1GZrCqpo91Oq1cfJpJ2zbxDHSun.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Landlord's Daughter","credit_id":"56f767fb9251417621001f38","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Opperman","original_name":"Frank Opperman","popularity":0.1082,"profile_path":"/hHwmtTj7qfE8Aquzpv8MOkgRQ3k.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Landlord","credit_id":"56f76810c3a3686a6b00582c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fritz Schade","original_name":"Fritz Schade","popularity":0.0498,"profile_path":"/eh3TB68Qo30M9TFPmWONqmB3dtl.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Young Boarder's Roommate","credit_id":"56f768239251412fdd00177d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1263417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billie Brockwell","original_name":"Billie Brockwell","popularity":0.0574,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"The Landlord's Wife","credit_id":"56f7683292514155f800592b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josef Swickard","original_name":"Josef Swickard","popularity":0.1683,"profile_path":"/fvkxWMqUjAmbHrBD1a0J2U4PIMO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Restaurant Manager","credit_id":"56f768419251417621001f43","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1117520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Griffin","original_name":"Frank Griffin","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f767bd9251412cc00026a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0005962","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hRSBHyqUDQGbiQtLtydMArAgKVj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/b1zAK5RkUpvLKwav6ZF1E52pjP6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/5DIq8qF286zQGzrhcBoTU2kbl8g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1915-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
