Shmaya makes Oshra part of his act and together, they perform real-life feats of magic and miracles before their slack-jawed audiences.\r Meanwhile, Shmaya’s father – a holy man with his own loyal following, is dying. He asks his followers to bring him his estranged son, so that he can take his place after his death and lead their community. Shmaya does just that and goes on to become a spiritual leader. However, his ongoing attraction to Oshra is now on a collision course with his new calling.","popularity":0.2979,"poster_path":"/i1UiQlPBWPpGdY9KxAYCTDUdTRM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90338,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nachsom Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"1990-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Appointed","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"המיועד","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1025031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shuli Rand","original_name":"Shuli Rand","popularity":0.0929,"profile_path":"/uIc3HucAjn8hksAzUJNdE2ysfkV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Shemya Ben-David","credit_id":"65bd4997c144dd017c015bc2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":19942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronit Elkabetz","original_name":"Ronit Elkabetz","popularity":0.2336,"profile_path":"/mSJTLszDzzacbE9m0XcFzWpMgUk.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Oshra","credit_id":"65bd497b459ad601616cd5f6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":585487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tzvi Shissel","original_name":"Tzvi Shissel","popularity":0.1238,"profile_path":"/sruuLvtGtuTZ4DeIDMv2Gv76Vlt.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Manager","credit_id":"65bd49ce11c0660162d11ee7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1950725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shabtai Konorti","original_name":"Shabtai Konorti","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Uzia","credit_id":"65bd49e12d1e4001845e22ac","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1443022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reuven Dayan","original_name":"Reuven Dayan","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":"/57npQJuE6luB6jXfPbaJ4Sn0pZn.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Head of Municipality","credit_id":"65bd4a03d7cd06017b564f42","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1076156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yitzhak Ne'eman","original_name":"Yitzhak Ne'eman","popularity":0.1048,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"The opponent","credit_id":"65bd4a26c144dd017c015c1b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1446511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Danino","original_name":"David Danino","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Michael","credit_id":"65bd4a4311c0660162d11f23","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1326713,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Wachsmann","original_name":"Daniel Wachsmann","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f71c159251417621000ec2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":52047,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ilan Rosenberg","original_name":"Ilan Rosenberg","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bd4c2e2d1e4001485b61e6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1470014,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Enrique Rottenberg","original_name":"Enrique Rottenberg","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bd4ba111c066017bd2eb14","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1269664,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Zohar M.
