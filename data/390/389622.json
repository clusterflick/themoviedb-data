Ben Wang’s BREATHIN’: THE EDDY ZHENG STORY paints an intimate portrait of Eddy—the prisoner, the immigrant, the son, the activist—on his journey to freedom, rehabilitation and redemption.  BREATHIN’ moves with a deep, critical love, unafraid in confronting the hard truths of Eddy’s crime, the harsh realities of mass incarceration and the intertwined emotional hardships experienced by all involved. The film finds Eddy at many crossroads — in and out of parole hearings, organizing in the community, othered and at risk of deportation — his resilience and astounding compassion resounding throughout. In chronicling Eddy’s decades-long struggle for freedom, the film interrogates the complexities and hypocrisies of crime and punishment in the United States, raising the greater question: For whom are prisons for?","popularity":0.0723,"poster_path":"/qK9PkVa8QKmub5LWdACc1R7xXon.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Breathin': The Eddy Zheng Story","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1596362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddy Zheng","original_name":"Eddy Zheng","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Eddy Zheng","credit_id":"56f5e9d5c3a3686a67001412","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1596361,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tina Nguyen","original_name":"Tina Nguyen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622fdb1c357c00001b45a675","department":"Editing","job":"Consulting Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1596359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"R.J.
