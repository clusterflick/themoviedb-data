These patterns reflect a variety of forms found throughout nature, and viewing their dynamics elicits an intuitive understanding of the invisible forces which underlie natural processes, from the movements of amoebae to the formation of galaxies. In the second part of this program Jonathan Goldman, top-selling New Age author (Healing Sounds) and musician (Chakra Chants CD), interviews British physician, Dr. Peter Guy Manners, who developed a therapeutic device based on the principles of Cymatics. In Part Three, Dr. Manners demonstrates the Cymatic Applicator, which resonates body tissue with audible sound.","popularity":0.0457,"poster_path":"/sENJosxmTtMC4vMAtLmo4B7APGR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":209357,"logo_path":null,"name":"MACROmedia Publishing","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cymatics: The Healing Nature of Sound","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4287705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Goldman","original_name":"Jonathan Goldman","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"650f8a19a3e4ba00abeeda82","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4287707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Guy Manners","original_name":"Peter Guy Manners","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"650f8a39e8d0b400ca85df0a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3646733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Volk","original_name":"Jeff Volk","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650f8956e1faed0100e89149","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sENJosxmTtMC4vMAtLmo4B7APGR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
