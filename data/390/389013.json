The movie begins when the tale of Sayun draws a television crew to the Atayal hamlet of Tyohemg (金岳) in Nanao Township (南澳), Yilan County. Yukan (Tsao Shih-hui, 曹世輝), a high-school boy and a young hunter, does not understand the crew members’ interest in the story. But his grandfather’s (Chang Chin-chen, 張金振) memories of Sayun, whom he went to school with, revives his interest in the old tribal village, which the villagers had been forced to desert 50 years prior.","popularity":0.1974,"poster_path":"/v37LyJFLDOOFLkQ8khIobmH0m5q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2011-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Finding Sayun","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3394680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jiwasi Dulan","original_name":"Jiwasi Dulan","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67106e60db79c9ceae0ec364","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1848369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beatrice Fang","original_name":"方志友","popularity":0.1692,"profile_path":"/vrtX1WHZ4wxG0EMTQIuPpTMtv73.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67106e44cf8de877b49f9218","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3678774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yulao Yukan","original_name":"Yulao Yukan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67106e79cf8de877b49f9227","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1401369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yukihiko Kageyama","original_name":"Yukihiko Kageyama","popularity":0.0928,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67106e891f9d0ee4b8c9bee8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3341114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shih-hui Tsao","original_name":"Shih-hui Tsao","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67106eca1b912add2edbb08a","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1588223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laha Mebow","original_name":"Laha Mebow","popularity":0.063,"profile_path":"/7hAuVMwDGjgI0CG5TqfLWxdfGPY.jpg","credit_id":"56f0ae0492514147d8001237","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5741496","wikidata_id":"Q10868794","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v37LyJFLDOOFLkQ8khIobmH0m5q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1430}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"不一樣的月光正式版預告 2011/11/2","key":"-aarI40ssWw","published_at":"2011-11-02T09:55:46.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"56f0af4592514118470017a9"}]}}}
