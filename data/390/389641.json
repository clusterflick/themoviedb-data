No one knows why Massimo has vowed to stop talking. Other than speaking dialog from classical plays, Massimo refuses to say a single word. His father, a classic-literature professor believes it reflects to a disappointing love affair. His new girlfriend thinks Massimo is rebelling against his mother, a poet. A director learns of Massimo and commissions his mother to write a play about him. Though Massimo plays himself in the play, and does speak, he returns to silence when the play is finished.","popularity":0.4334,"poster_path":"/mtARuL8weQjPrBK2CNdtLcDpKSz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26805,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmalbatros","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":27124,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pierre
