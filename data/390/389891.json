Piera Degli Esposti plays the widowed, impoverished mother of a huge farm family. The woman moves her nine children to Bologna, where their living conditions are deplorable. To avoid a hike in rent, she tells her landlady (Dominique Sanda) that she is living alone. Also known as To Save Nine (a curiously brief English-language title for a Wertmuller film!), IL Decimo Clandestino was expanded from 60 to 90 minutes for its theatrical release.","popularity":0.3929,"poster_path":"/j3Z2XHpCZGw5S9zCZa5Qk7srgf6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1242,"logo_path":"/qOvcm1WCLlAdNoQ1kCkk2J7bhWk.png","name":"Reteitalia","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":66292,"logo_path":null,"name":"Video
