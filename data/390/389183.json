No documentary record could have done it justice.","popularity":0.2948,"poster_path":"/lTs5xMlIIDoiFRN7Q0N3HnMClrB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1970-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paradise Now","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3637980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diana Van Tosh","original_name":"Diana Van Tosh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62dffeb355bc350054ca17bd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2481800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Anderson","original_name":"Jim Anderson","popularity":0.0669,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62dfff1055bc350054ca17ef","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3637986,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franck Hogeboom","original_name":"Franck Hogeboom","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62dfffaed2b2090055ca586f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julian Beck","original_name":"Julian Beck","popularity":0.1146,"profile_path":"/8bujAoKVLxTPvggUpDYSGfnKHR4.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66c14eff5ca8a554abed0195","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":119864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judith Malina","original_name":"Judith Malina","popularity":0.1798,"profile_path":"/nMXmUmvkavejiqWzNPicgG1IU50.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66c14f64363909091ba26783","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1410167,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sheldon Rochlin","original_name":"Sheldon Rochlin","popularity":0.0883,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f23a66c3a36807660006ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0235658","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2PdadAE26H8ANWn9zUEvmgmzYWl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lTs5xMlIIDoiFRN7Q0N3HnMClrB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":313794,"name":"experimental theatre"},{"id":336219,"name":"the living theatre"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
