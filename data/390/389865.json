Starting with the corrupt practices of Lord Kira and Yanagi-sawa, the Shogun's Secretary, which in essence led to the incident of Lord Asano's attacking Kira in the Pine Corridor of the Shogun's Palace, this is the definitive version. Asano Takumi no kami was a young lord with high scruples, who refused to join in the general corruption and bribery which ran rampant in the capital at that time. By not giving bribes, he angered Kira Kozuke no suke the elder lord in charge of protocol at the Palace. Refusing to teach the younger man, and giving him false instructions was only the beginning. Insults followed, and a man of honor had no choice but to draw his sword in anger. Forty seven masterless samurai are willing to give their lives to avenge their lord.","popularity":0.422,"poster_path":"/9GAo5uKU4YN8TI70RSlYZ1Ny6xA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5822,"logo_path":"/qyTbRgCyU9NLKvKaiQVbadtr7RY.png","name":"Toei Company","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1959-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":183,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The 47 Masterless Samurai","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Chushingura Ouka No Maki, Kikka No Maki","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Utaemon Ichikawa","original_name":"市川右太衛門","popularity":0.385,"profile_path":"/sXJb8Z354NipGJGOwxSeQcDYnZd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"56f732f592514155f8004e15","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chiezō Kataoka","original_name":"片岡千恵蔵","popularity":0.3374,"profile_path":"/q3zrD3nnHSb72rmT647Zakx5IV0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"56f7330092514155f8004e17","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":108025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michiyo Kogure","original_name":"Michiyo Kogure","popularity":0.2896,"profile_path":"/5OsLOgxYrwiqGmnLvRXkfuuNgsi.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"56f7330ac3a3686a61004afa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":945638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hibari Misora","original_name":"美空ひばり","popularity":0.4506,"profile_path":"/9dCnULSXePN46VGNiD3XMEJj7LI.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"56f7331392514155fb004b77","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sō Yamamura","original_name":"山村聰","popularity":0.523,"profile_path":"/norRWkMGfj3OGT42hKdQ5FvSBG2.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"56f73320c3a3686a6b004d59","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryutaro Otomo","original_name":"大友柳太朗","popularity":0.4719,"profile_path":"/ytpAwnbKaKQZQuSMBWWkK1URcse.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"56f73341c3a3686a6b004d67","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hashizo Okawa","original_name":"二代目 大川橋蔵","popularity":0.2342,"profile_path":"/vy0pXYPzIEFkrDOfhcr0XmRq8JA.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"593cdf1fc3a3680f33017033","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2048274,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Tadaoto Kainoshō","original_name":"甲斐庄楠音","popularity":0.1338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653bb708bc2cb300eafc0b43","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":981062,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sadatsugu Matsuda","original_name":"松田定次","popularity":0.3087,"profile_path":"/hiAHxNLo86yBFb3LHfD3harFasq.jpg","credit_id":"56f732b3c3a3686a5c004c83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1340297,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yoshitake Hisa","original_name":"比佐芳武","popularity":0.2477,"profile_path":"/j7NtpyABCQazCZyg4HlP6axQfhW.jpg","credit_id":"66a5db685fa0a91b931551cb","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0186921","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/9GAo5uKU4YN8TI70RSlYZ1Ny6xA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1462,"name":"samurai"},{"id":1908,"name":"katana"},{"id":155198,"name":"ronin"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1959-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
