The program documents some of the first observations made by the telescope, foreshadowing the scientific rewards that will be its heritage.  Filmed on three continents--and at altitudes ranging from sea level to 16,500 feet--the film features breathtaking views of Chile's remote Atacama Desert, and demonstrates the lengths to which humans will go to understand the universe they call home.  ","popularity":0.0828,"poster_path":"/4Psn0ZRsLPVRiEFruSi8PNMchay.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74532,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mark Pingry Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Into Deepest Space: The Birth of the ALMA Telescope","video":true,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1180811,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nils Cowan","original_name":"Nils Cowan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f11e269251417d54000e31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1180811,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nils Cowan","original_name":"Nils Cowan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f11e36925141184a00289b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3084942","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cepE31VDBp6RJ8QSxvknbI5hm1v.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4Psn0ZRsLPVRiEFruSi8PNMchay.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1N9OACQYOHagiXslAnLhIOrTQaR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
