The colonel of the regiment wants his daughter to marry the lieutenant but she has her heart set on the chubby-faced Hardy, who himself is in love with another woman. He is thrown into a cell for disobeying orders, where he later escapes with the assistance of his sweetheart, and a casual touch of assault when he bumps the guard with his large stomach. The final chase scene ends with everyone getting what they want.","popularity":0.432,"poster_path":"/A4w7jMyWheqkQKADsFaK5ImbwtK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85302,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vim Comedy Film Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love and Duty","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Liebe und Hiebe","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Hardy","original_name":"Oliver Hardy","popularity":1.0454,"profile_path":"/qRMGQo5oWwcLpwgXSoArXK5riwe.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Pvt.
