Arrived on the campus, he approaches a grave and reverend senior to ask where the proctor is located. The senior knocks off his hat. Willie replaces it and laughs feebly at the joke. The senior sternly tells him to take it off and be respectful to his betters. Willie obeys, and awe-stricken, repeats his question. The senior points, Willie dodges, gathers up his suitcases and exits cautiously, watching the senior. The proctor places him in a room with a senior, who makes life a burden to him, using him as a valet.","popularity":0.1256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Willie's Sister","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Morrison","original_name":"James Morrison","popularity":0.1369,"profile_path":"/74FZiGds3xQqRB7Ee0WJLqMzee1.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Willie Green","credit_id":"56f7c4909251410ce4000a66","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1358772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Earle Williams","original_name":"Earle Williams","popularity":0.109,"profile_path":"/h8NOjETlZvKzVeRp5uAalEoPOu3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Willie's Room-Mate","credit_id":"56f7c4a1c3a3686a6b006731","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tefft Johnson","original_name":"Tefft Johnson","popularity":0.1436,"profile_path":"/ioAvdqZHSTOSwZcVeNamE0BBAfl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"56f7c4acc3a3686a6b006735","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1173026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Schaefer","original_name":"Anne Schaefer","popularity":0.1035,"profile_path":"/9qRdeDOGNal4hgTZhWJ7OhLwMvG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"56f7c4bd9251410ce4000a71","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1597009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beatrice Behrman","original_name":"Beatrice Behrman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Willie's Sister","credit_id":"56f7c4c9c3a3686a6e006c1b","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0226641","wikidata_id":"Q17499988","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1912-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
