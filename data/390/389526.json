To make enough money to ensure his daughter Gen's (Irene Hervey) entree into society, Nick sells his services to a gang of foreign spies, who then use Nick's establishment as a rendezvous point. The plan is to covertly send out a Japanese vessel for the purpose of raiding and destroying American merchant ships. The spies' secret code is hidden in the lyrics of a song called \"Lydia\", which the unwitting Gen performs on request day after day.","popularity":0.8588,"poster_path":"/s2hBTDQxgxrFhyZuVFUrcd9teUG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"THE INVISIBLE FOE Uncovered...as youth takes a rap at the Japs!","title":"Unseen Enemy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Carrillo","original_name":"Leo Carrillo","popularity":0.1883,"profile_path":"/2vnSRTNNUcaay4PcnOTCqDCwjqf.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Nick Rand","credit_id":"56f539cd9251417a440021e0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Devine","original_name":"Andy Devine","popularity":0.6374,"profile_path":"/rBCv7cszfbo2dkQbGxxff9xTppL.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Detective Sam Dillon","credit_id":"56f539dbc3a36827580021d4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":111581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irene Hervey","original_name":"Irene Hervey","popularity":0.1638,"profile_path":"/aWaApYfZh2ROdh4V3dWDphJHYx1.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Gen Rand","credit_id":"56f539af9251417a490020c4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1107463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Terry","original_name":"Don Terry","popularity":0.0962,"profile_path":"/c8WOWWoESlLrHbTvU8DLPE86TDc.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"William Flynn Hitchcock / Bill Flinn","credit_id":"56f539bfc3a368274100244f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lionel Royce","original_name":"Lionel Royce","popularity":0.1587,"profile_path":"/gtyyXldWJw1nDmPsAH0GROQ7hDS.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"German Captain Wilhelm Roering","credit_id":"56f539e89251417a490020ce","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45380,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Turhan Bey","original_name":"Turhan Bey","popularity":0.128,"profile_path":"/YugYyfwqXp9C3Qj0oNaNJVmbf6.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Ito","credit_id":"56f539f4c3a368273b0026c5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":112356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederick Giermann","original_name":"Frederick Giermann","popularity":0.0656,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Franz Mueller, as Frederick Gierman","credit_id":"56f53a029251412eb40008f3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Ruhl","original_name":"William Ruhl","popularity":0.0738,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Detective Callahan","credit_id":"56f53a0f9251417a490020d6","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clancy Cooper","original_name":"Clancy Cooper","popularity":0.201,"profile_path":"/97pn7p7DiS4MMkhiBEZFgVskjkf.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Police Inspector Alan Davies","credit_id":"56f53a1c9251417a40002100","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Fetherston","original_name":"Eddie Fetherston","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/tWoMtn9jYC0ZixRJQgLIfzh9xHQ.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Badger - Taxicab Driver","credit_id":"56f53a2f9251417a440021ec","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1026240,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"George Wallace Sayre","original_name":"George Wallace Sayre","popularity":0.1127,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f53969c3a36827460022d4","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20098,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stanley Rubin","original_name":"Stanley Rubin","popularity":0.1544,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f5395bc3a368273b0026a2","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97015,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Rawlins","original_name":"John Rawlins","popularity":0.1844,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f53948c3a36827490021d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70263,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Roy Chanslor","original_name":"Roy Chanslor","popularity":0.172,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f53951c3a36827580021bd","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12348,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Russell A.
