An older man walks through the corridors of a half-empty airport, and he feels alone and sad. He takes a photograph out of his wallet, tears it in two and drops it on the moving walkway. Both are torn in two. A girl in Paris is alone with a cat. A man arrives in Warsaw, and a woman is there to meet him. She drives him to his parents’ home. An accident, a murder—nothing alters the imperturbable course of life.","popularity":0.2321,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":108918,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sépia Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":874,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinéa","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":78183,"logo_path":null,"name":"STI Studio Filmowe","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1995-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'Aube à l'envers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":73937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judith Godrèche","original_name":"Judith Godrèche","popularity":0.437,"profile_path":"/wtoYVeYdi0Uv00eFbtEvUZCdEge.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"56f6020192514155f500192c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerzy Grałek","original_name":"Jerzy Grałek","popularity":0.0502,"profile_path":"/hdLAV2VgZye0fK25gSglHSpJTjx.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"56f6020b92514155fe0019c8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":7110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Nehrebecka","original_name":"Anna Nehrebecka","popularity":0.1397,"profile_path":"/cmvuniqw1XwC0RQV9YrTBKTQjCX.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"56f6021992514155fe0019cc","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Marceau","original_name":"Sophie Marceau","popularity":2.3364,"profile_path":"/ggYd5jtI9mNB0VRY05EeY8fN2nX.jpg","credit_id":"56f601dfc3a3686a67001a1a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3561,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Paweł Edelman","original_name":"Paweł Edelman","popularity":0.0747,"profile_path":"/8EIe47eJGNBpixNLHztVEcFTKWR.jpg","credit_id":"66d5910edbcef1a290cb74db","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0112411","wikidata_id":"Q4390351","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
