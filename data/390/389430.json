Laura is a professor at a shabby, stultifying college. Her daughter, Laurita, stops going to school, wishes to move to Madagascar and quickly races through several phases. One day, she looks like a heavy-metal fan, another like a bohemian who weeps at poetry and art. Slowly, she crosses the line from ordinary adolescent confusion to intense neurosis and beyond, finally becoming so obsessed with religion and good works that she brings 10 homeless children into the cramped house she shares with her mother and grandmother.","popularity":0.1217,"poster_path":"/4pSyTtGBXcfadko6GgMv6n9bGZq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5175,"logo_path":"/sEc4VmMYh1G09ySm8ThZ5S3gcUS.png","name":"ICAIC","origin_country":"CU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"}],"release_date":"1995-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Madagascar","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2470687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zaida Castellanos","original_name":"Zaida Castellanos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Laura","credit_id":"5de12ad73faba0001908c8fc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":989815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura de la Uz","original_name":"Laura de la Uz","popularity":0.1329,"profile_path":"/rpMuTeMC0LXfeQroFNvfDDfz3N6.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Laurita","credit_id":"5de12ae00cd446001934b946","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1056028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabel Santos","original_name":"Elena Bolaños","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Abuela","credit_id":"5de12acec51acd0015f57170","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":168608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jorge Molina","original_name":"Jorge Molina","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":"/4lOBx2zjbHBnA7U2rXMOYsEt33L.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Molina","credit_id":"5de12aebc51acd0015f5718f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1505390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramón Brito","original_name":"Ramón Brito","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Alberto","credit_id":"5de3cc4a11386c00114eda92","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1538097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susana Alonso","original_name":"Susana Alonso","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Mercedes","credit_id":"5de3cc62a7e36300196b3192","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2472411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yolanda Ruiz","original_name":"Yolanda Ruiz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Profesora I","credit_id":"5de3cc713faba000130caa57","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2472412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmen Rivera","original_name":"Carmen Rivera","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Profesora II","credit_id":"5de3cc7fa7e36300196b31f5","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4004031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nancy Rodriguez","original_name":"Nancy Rodriguez","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Profesora III","credit_id":"64346f59d132d60077edb200","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2472413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto Delgado","original_name":"Roberto Delgado","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Catedrático","credit_id":"5de3cca711386c00164ed6d4","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2472416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jose Ramon Vigo","original_name":"Jose Ramon Vigo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Inspector","credit_id":"5de3cdb811386c00164ed963","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2472417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Basilio Garcia","original_name":"Basilio Garcia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Basilio","credit_id":"5de3cdc411386c00164ed981","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2472418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Baluja","original_name":"Laura Baluja","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Comecol I","credit_id":"5de3cdd2a7e36300146b5040","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2472419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Armando Zambrano","original_name":"Armando Zambrano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Comecol II","credit_id":"5de3cddc3faba000150da1c2","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2472420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reynaldo Rojas","original_name":"Reynaldo Rojas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Comecol III","credit_id":"5de3cde70cd4460014388a90","order":14},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2472421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jose A.
