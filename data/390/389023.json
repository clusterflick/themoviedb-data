Rebellions and revolutions had followed one after the other for decades. Though things were beginning to settle down some, it was still a time when one had the feeling that anything could happen. This film tells the story of one boy's sexual coming-of-age during that time, punctuated by a peasant rebellion sparked by religious concerns (Catholicism had been officially suppressed). The lad has a crush on the wife of the Army man sent to put down the rebellion. He also has an affair with a local woman and briefly runs away with a pretty young prostitute.","popularity":0.2647,"poster_path":"/5hTX1aV5FCLgjFA7WsxO0hvYvDo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"1972-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Days of Love","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jorge Martínez de Hoyos","original_name":"Jorge Martínez de Hoyos","popularity":0.2947,"profile_path":"/nPALS6J1GaeSWNx24j06jqCuFBI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65bc18d9f031740163674fc6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1174407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita Blanch","original_name":"Anita Blanch","popularity":0.1081,"profile_path":"/MFzHhmeZ7umi1JuKtLrjdxda1T.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65bc18e511c066017bd0e562","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arturo Beristáin","original_name":"Arturo Beristáin","popularity":0.1108,"profile_path":"/3CUi3cTQ2VyvpvNMDdNzZYwuRRI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65bc18ed7646fd014abcfe49","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":173733,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Isaac","original_name":"Alberto Isaac","popularity":0.0681,"profile_path":"/3YVlzRH2MHbJpfuXXTxKGsu9Yir.jpg","credit_id":"56f0c4c4c3a3680af1001403","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":173733,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Isaac","original_name":"Alberto Isaac","popularity":0.0681,"profile_path":"/3YVlzRH2MHbJpfuXXTxKGsu9Yir.jpg","credit_id":"65bc19052b8a43017b1c42eb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1697365,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Lucero Isaac","original_name":"Lucero Isaac","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bc192bf03174017c681420","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1539195,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emilio García Riera","original_name":"Emilio García Riera","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/wz6aUkjDbcGdFwUBsMJZ5yDclJB.jpg","credit_id":"65bc195fe18b97017b9a7103","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1844518,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"José Antonio Alcaraz","original_name":"José Antonio Alcaraz","popularity":0.084,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bc1984d556970183aa6257","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388727,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lucía Álvarez","original_name":"Lucía Álvarez","popularity":0.1599,"profile_path":"/vlYvszhvfwHtEHSZ0CCrtxhhEMB.jpg","credit_id":"65bc1998d7cd060148535a4f","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234726,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Raúl Lavista","original_name":"Raúl Lavista","popularity":0.0853,"profile_path":"/f9HjW8Y0cI3lVZ2779wOvxUuWaU.jpg","credit_id":"65bc19a611c066017bd0e5be","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0067033","wikidata_id":"Q3259787","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/5hTX1aV5FCLgjFA7WsxO0hvYvDo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Los días del amor (1972) Dir.
