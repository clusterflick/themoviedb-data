The song-and-dance performer here is none other than the great Bill Robinson.","popularity":0.2205,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":74672,"logo_path":null,"name":"RCM Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Let's Scuffle","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Robinson","original_name":"Bill Robinson","popularity":0.1542,"profile_path":"/inHoDjE4FXwkSq2OQJu3T2RiSoR.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"HImself","credit_id":"56f5a75fc3a3686a6e000786","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1596226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanne Bayer","original_name":"Jeanne Bayer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Bar-room Patron","credit_id":"56f5a78ec3a36816e800041e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1422133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deanie Gordon","original_name":"Deanie Gordon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Patron in Bar-room","credit_id":"56f5a7a39251415601000701","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1596229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Winnie Johnson","original_name":"Winnie Johnson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Patron","credit_id":"56f5a7b892514155f50006b4","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0231967","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":246,"name":"dancing"},{"id":12990,"name":"singing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1942-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bill Bojangles Robinson - Lets Scuffle","key":"fe7mcLai5OM","published_at":"2014-01-18T10:21:30.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"56f5a96dc3a3686a6b00074b"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bill Bojangles Robinson- Let's Scuffle..AVI","key":"RRo-aC1pggg","published_at":"2010-02-18T08:34:38.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"56f5a92f9251415604000700"}]}}}
