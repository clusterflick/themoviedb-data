Filmed in black and white, the dark filming emulates the oppression experienced by the prisoner. In the story, the writer is a prisoner who has not yet been \"broken.\" That is, he has not yet succumbed to the skillfully applied tortures and signed a written confession of his so-called crimes. He is supposed to have planned a bombing incident. He endures an escalating number of indignities, until a fellow prisoner tells him what happens at the next level of torture, in which he would be sent to a \"psychiatric\" hospital.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/4pbznl3tUyZ9EJBcGEcgt9K8OCy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cell","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310648,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Horst Bienek","original_name":"Horst Bienek","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f0bc27c3a3687177001a88","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0163426","wikidata_id":"Q32873657","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.658,"height":1718,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4pbznl3tUyZ9EJBcGEcgt9K8OCy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1131}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
