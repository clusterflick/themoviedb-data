Pennebaker's famous movie documenting the festival). For many fans this was the period when Janis Joplin was at her best, before the pressure of fame and the ravages of drugs took over. This is the first DVD to release these KQED TV tracks. The songs are interspersed with short interviews with Janis and other band members, all in excellent sound and picture quality for the era. In addition to 'Ball And Chain', which was to appear on the group's second album in the following year, the set features two of the group's hit singles, 'Down On Me' and 'Coo Coo'. This package also includes a bonus audio CD of the tracks.","popularity":0.0952,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Janis Joplin with Big Brother: Ball and Chain","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janis Joplin","original_name":"Janis Joplin","popularity":0.2595,"profile_path":"/hMYnBrk5Gar4THBjoWwQ5SHXItK.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"self","credit_id":"56f6ba02c3a3686a5c0039cf","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1596609,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert N.
