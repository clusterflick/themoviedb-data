In the story, Heinz is a laborer in the cooperative apple orchards of an East German village and has married his sweetheart Lena. She works to take care of the sickly wife of the co-op's manager and also must cope with the sexual attentions of the perfidious man. One day, after discovering this state of affairs, Heinz blows up and assaults his wife's harasser, which only serves to land him in jail. While in prison, the state secret police (the Stasi) get him to help them entrap the co-op manager, whom they believe is going to try to defect.","popularity":0.1828,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":249231,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alert Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1992-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Apple Trees","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1320989,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johanna Schall","original_name":"Johanna Schall","popularity":0.1501,"profile_path":"/AdazFpHB1UWSpvUUvEq7ba0Xkc5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lena","credit_id":"5c7dc1160e0a26322b0fb635","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1822457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Büchel","original_name":"Thomas Büchel","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Heinz","credit_id":"5c7dc1209251411e73482c09","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22721,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steffie Spira","original_name":"Steffie Spira","popularity":0.1073,"profile_path":"/iBxsWKoGBxax01ug3D3JfU5TWdy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Großmutter","credit_id":"5c7dc12f0e0a26322b0fb655","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2064720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Schäfer","original_name":"Eva Schäfer","popularity":0.105,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"alte Frau","credit_id":"5c7dc145c3a3680ed218d808","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":56203,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helma Sanders-Brahms","original_name":"Helma Sanders-Brahms","popularity":0.1363,"profile_path":"/yQkYninke1jTVI3hUz4oAALZ7Fe.jpg","credit_id":"56f6a59692514125d6002a04","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0103708","wikidata_id":"Q4781243","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
