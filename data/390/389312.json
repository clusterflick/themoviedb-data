For too long it’s been seen as a stuffy genre for the high cultured elite. WHAT WOULD BEETHOVEN DO? follows a number of renegades, from composers flirting with modern mediums, to young musicians dedicated to changing the narrative, to a man who’s bringing turntablists and orchestras together. Notable artists such as, Bobby McFerrin, Benjamin Zander and Eric Whitacre add their voices to the debate about why classical music is still relevant today.","popularity":0.1721,"poster_path":"/bFZ4yUpZX848FGQhCiqtRBXzM4R.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140546,"logo_path":null,"name":"Magnetic North
