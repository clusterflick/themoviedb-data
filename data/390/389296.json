In THE KIDS MENU, Joe meets with experts, parents, teachers and kids, coming to the realization that childhood obesity isn't the real issue, but rather a symptom of a bigger problem. The lack of knowledge of what healthy foods are. Lack of access to healthy and affordable options. And the influence of negative role models, whether a parent, teacher or even a celebrity. All of this together seems to be a lot to overcome, but when empowered, kids often make the surprising choice of the healthier path.","popularity":0.1931,"poster_path":"/iyHtV8PHwwtY5zDsak0d6CKHVhV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kids Menu","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":567557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Cross","original_name":"Joe Cross","popularity":0.0684,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56f3149a9251411a87000281","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1594957,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jamin Mendelsohn","original_name":"Jamin Mendelsohn","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f314899251411a8d000278","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":567559,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kurt Engfehr","original_name":"Kurt Engfehr","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f31452c3a3682fd200026e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":567559,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kurt Engfehr","original_name":"Kurt Engfehr","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f31474c3a3682fcf000279","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5170360","wikidata_id":"Q24607060","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eD4NTtd0X75ODiwLNazbaRIJdGx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.658,"height":1519,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iyHtV8PHwwtY5zDsak0d6CKHVhV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
