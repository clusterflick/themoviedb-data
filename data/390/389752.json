He reaches a train station in a city which is paralyzed by a transportation strike and is forced to take lodgings in a bizarre, unattractive town populated by seemingly malformed individuals. After a while, he begins to try to woo a much older woman, and symbolic images of entrapment, imprisonment and erotic enticement mark his adventures in this regard.","popularity":0.349,"poster_path":"/xPFHJ8OYq6A3rXQDl78htMTuG7v.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18857,"logo_path":null,"name":"Neue Studio
