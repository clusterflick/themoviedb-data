A mundane job as an accountant and an empty house comprise his life. Day in and day out, he goes through the same routine he has for the past five years. He feels hollow and alone. He is... nobody. Until one day a chance encounter changes everything. Now as he evades capture by the powers that be, he must fight to uncover a terrifying secret buried deep within the walls of the Pentagon and the confines of his own mind. Only after a helping hand reaches out from the shadows does David learn that his success or failure will ultimately affect the lives of hundreds.","popularity":0.1314,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":74736,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bat Pig Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":117080,"logo_path":null,"name":"Skyline
