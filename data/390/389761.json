This particular man tells him that \"people don't die, they get killed.\" For some reason, this strikes the lonely television repairman as profound. He has been building a ham radio at home out of spare parts so that he will have someone to talk to. Shortly after talking to the street person, his circle of friends is diminished by one when his friend Alex is reported to have killed himself. This in itself is a bit of a mystery, and Tim attempts to make sense of it by talking to a lawyer, Alex's girlfriend, and others.","popularity":0.1711,"poster_path":"/oX3YRBz8ItANKCPmvzddqeyfmPt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Modern Crimes","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":206524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Ward","original_name":"Roy Ward","popularity":0.1849,"profile_path":"/7SRb5zyfS1drC7UvkKxxuSZ4lzU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tim","credit_id":"619169c04581990064c38814","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21031,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alejandro Agresti","original_name":"Alejandro Agresti","popularity":0.1557,"profile_path":"/b41SE0CRRW0D1izYltdBDahSdjW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"619169e887ae7b0044c35cd3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1440424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adrian Brine","original_name":"Adrian Brine","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Man in Train","credit_id":"61916ab7c4ad5900446eb627","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2344935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jake Kruyer","original_name":"Jake Kruyer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"61916acbb6cff10027a8c50f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":936410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pim Lambeau","original_name":"Pim Lambeau","popularity":0.0734,"profile_path":"/woUk7U4JtJqETesUBRHUOJcChBL.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"61916addbc8abc0062e0fab9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3309533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Limon","original_name":"Helen Limon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Sara","credit_id":"61916b0115376c008c0dbb7e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3309534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toine Paauwe","original_name":"Toine Paauwe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Best Colleague","credit_id":"61916b24f85958008fc49644","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2103836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Sheppard","original_name":"Frank Sheppard","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Witness","credit_id":"61916b70957e6d0060ab8704","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3309536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robbert van Dijk","original_name":"Robbert van Dijk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Priest","credit_id":"61916b8eb6cff10065dee1a8","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1367040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bonnie Williams","original_name":"Bonnie Williams","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"61916ba43e2ec8008d059fd4","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2178994,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Néstor Sanz","original_name":"Néstor Sanz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61916cb0bfeb8b00625145eb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21038,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul M. van Brugge","original_name":"Paul M. van Brugge","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/nPtwxpAODX2RuWKaI1jLUQtNwul.jpg","credit_id":"61916d54724de1002bebd423","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21031,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alejandro Agresti","original_name":"Alejandro Agresti","popularity":0.1557,"profile_path":"/b41SE0CRRW0D1izYltdBDahSdjW.jpg","credit_id":"61916bf942f19f00680f76e8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21031,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alejandro Agresti","original_name":"Alejandro Agresti","popularity":0.1557,"profile_path":"/b41SE0CRRW0D1izYltdBDahSdjW.jpg","credit_id":"56f6aa4a9251412cc00008b4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0104900","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oX3YRBz8ItANKCPmvzddqeyfmPt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
