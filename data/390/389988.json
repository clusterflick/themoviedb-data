But unless viewers consider the feminine eyeball or microscopic views of skin exotic and worth lingering over, the eroticism lies more in the imagination than on the screen. In fact, the female body lying on the bed, taken away from the spirit that animates it, is really just a corpse -- raising the question, exactly what is the \"malady of death?\"","popularity":0.1578,"poster_path":"/v2bknZ8jNTIP1X5lp3ou1X54sw9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3391,"logo_path":"/t0QBs2fI3mE3HxgoH1n39bYuzNu.png","name":"ORF","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":2279,"logo_path":null,"name":"MR Filmproduktion","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1985-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Malady of Death","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37351,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Colbin","original_name":"Marie Colbin","popularity":0.1262,"profile_path":"/a0KHv5y3fvD7zvUWb99C2E2Lla1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"the anonymous woman","credit_id":"582a11a79251417b1803bea8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2305,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Handke","original_name":"Peter Handke","popularity":0.1159,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"the narrator","credit_id":"582a11b19251417b2103b0ce","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2305,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Handke","original_name":"Peter Handke","popularity":0.1159,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f82dec9251414c1d0003ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2305,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Handke","original_name":"Peter Handke","popularity":0.1159,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"582a11c69251417b2303a0f5","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":20452,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marie Homolkova","original_name":"Marie Homolkova","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"582a11ebc3a368623f0172e5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29905,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marguerite Duras","original_name":"Marguerite Duras","popularity":0.3234,"profile_path":"/fcwhMcwUzh4AtHew16vS4OVDYdO.jpg","credit_id":"582a11cc9251417b2603d677","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3768,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xaver Schwarzenberger","original_name":"Xaver Schwarzenberger","popularity":0.1481,"profile_path":"/sFusGdTURBrwWvUvdaFpyv9F7Io.jpg","credit_id":"5f4877fea2e6020034f7242e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1708776,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sambuca Nigra","original_name":"Sambuca Nigra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f48780aa2e6020035f53ada","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2799361,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Kurt Rosner","original_name":"Kurt Rosner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7607dafea0d700360d8f3f","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2799360,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Andrea Jaufer","original_name":"Andrea Jaufer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7607d121621b003535326b","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2799359,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Folkert Prestin","original_name":"Folkert Prestin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7607c71967570039956f5b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1242756","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v2bknZ8jNTIP1X5lp3ou1X54sw9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cannes (\"Un certain regard\")","release_date":"1985-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
