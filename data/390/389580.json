The Shade is a drama about a mysterious woman and a pawnbroker who meet in New York. The film begins with Simon, who is alone in his apartment with the corpse of his wife, Anna, who has just committed suicide. In his grief, he remembers the first time he met her, a year ago when she walked into his pawnbroker's shop in Spanish Harlem. Mysterious Anna, who seems to come from nowhere, impresses solitary Simon with her sad beauty, and he proposes to her on their first night out. The Shade is a love story with great psychological insight.","popularity":0.8394,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":205771,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmaker","origin_country":""},{"id":19494,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stolen Car Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":239622,"logo_path":null,"name":"Whole Nine Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Shade","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Edson","original_name":"Richard Edson","popularity":0.4844,"profile_path":"/vuuU7beZrawR6VZB3a2QhDVtkjg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Simon","credit_id":"66ef1c5dd4a8ac49678d3cf0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1975543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorie Marino","original_name":"Lorie Marino","popularity":0.0411,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Anna","credit_id":"66ef1c80a82b005703260f3a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1507954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Haas","original_name":"Barbara Haas","popularity":0.0904,"profile_path":"/hH8egrfRZsSIxB2MpNC6suBMZKL.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"La Mere","credit_id":"66ef1caaa82b005703260f5d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2013759,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacob Lavin","original_name":"Jacob Lavin","popularity":0.1197,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Le Neveu","credit_id":"66ef1ccf6c3b7a8d648d3c57","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":171346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeffrey Ware","original_name":"Jeffrey Ware","popularity":0.1949,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Moser","credit_id":"66ef1cf2c237258e4c25fef6","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raphaël Nadjari","original_name":"Raphaël Nadjari","popularity":0.0983,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f588d6c3a3686a64000278","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223230,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fyodor Dostoevsky","original_name":"Фёдор Достоевский","popularity":0.5795,"profile_path":"/hMm3y5n60KNvLB5F14oCfo8imSK.jpg","credit_id":"59fe000492514146bd0210ae","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raphaël Nadjari","original_name":"Raphaël Nadjari","popularity":0.0983,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59fdfffbc3a36867f6022430","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":32807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Surman","original_name":"John Surman","popularity":0.0652,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672ad38514d4a399720365a9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0216204","wikidata_id":"Q3522668","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
