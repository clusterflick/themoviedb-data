Every single day, they will violate the rights of nonhuman animals.  “SHAC ACTION” shows SHAC Action films and demo footages done at “ Time For Action 1, 2” and the newly released “Time for Action 3”. Also included is the SHAC USA film Strikeback.\r “THE TRUTH” shows the nonhuman rights violations that take place inside this vivisection lab.
