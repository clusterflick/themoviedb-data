The trouble is, he's got two extra personalities who pop out and ruin things: an id, who's usually naked and has no inhibitions, and a super ego, who's a prude and a scold. Our hero goes through his little black book calling woman after woman: Natalie agrees to a date, but the warring three-headed personalities sink that outing before he gets through her apartment door. Soon, he's down to the last name in his book: Zolga. Is there any hope? Can he just be one self?","popularity":0.0621,"poster_path":"/5JYGVzKAyUUtfNJ4prgNXHlPCBj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1992-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Problem","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1164747,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Craig Welch","original_name":"Craig Welch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d2550e0a517c007e22b80f","department":"Art","job":"Concept Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1331997,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Douglas Macdonald","original_name":"Douglas Macdonald","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d25533071650005d4f2aa8","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1030566,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barrie McLean","original_name":"Barrie McLean","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d2554295c0af0075e032a0","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":46434,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marcy Page","original_name":"Marcy Page","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d255250a517c0023d35b9d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389416,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Denis L.
