One tribeswoman expresses a desire to have a child, but is rebuked by being reminded that she has vowed never to have worldly ties that would distract her from the quest. When she has a child anyway, she and her lover are made to pay for this crime in a horrific way. Despite that, the child becomes a kind of holy mascot for the group, touted by the leader as a kind of savior. They are distressed when the child goes missing one day, only to appear mysteriously on the opposite side of the rapids of a river, beckoning to them.","popularity":0.1329,"poster_path":"/4kwWrbvrEYse5DeiM6hd5bXoVUT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16158,"logo_path":"/reOYfM5jvosymeNcSoNiUoGz6n4.png","name":"Tajikfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet
