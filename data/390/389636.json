The painting depicts two beautiful, naked young women engaged in a tender act. The result is the notorious painting in which the nude girls are depicted with one of them daintily holding the nipple of the other. Naturally, the finished work causes quite a stir in Comte's prudish household. Though rumors persist of a feature-length version of this film, they are unfounded: it was originally shot and produced as a 35-minute short, and that was the version that ran and was reviewed at Cannes.","popularity":0.7704,"poster_path":"/izRqZ4MV2581AZLniSRvJKZ49WP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1995-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Nudes Bathing","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Hurt","original_name":"John Hurt","popularity":1.8848,"profile_path":"/bjNSzt1d7uK3q5PbtFXUJrRt4qg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Marquis de Prey","credit_id":"59476e41c3a36816e4037c99","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charley Boorman","original_name":"Charley Boorman","popularity":0.1777,"profile_path":"/7aUStN1A5RcQMYS1PZyL2Vlcbfj.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Le peintre","credit_id":"59476e4cc3a368265f018342","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":63358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angeline Ball","original_name":"Angeline Ball","popularity":0.3671,"profile_path":"/cnz8cEAj2KUSjt2DVbZktboux3X.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Simone","credit_id":"59476e61c3a368171b0352cd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1835628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jocelyne West","original_name":"Jocelyne West","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Gabrielle","credit_id":"59476e979251413fdd03853f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":135172,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juliette Caton","original_name":"Juliette Caton","popularity":0.0887,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Blanche","credit_id":"59476ea39251413fc203716a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1835629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Britta Bates","original_name":"Britta Bates","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Nana","credit_id":"59476eaec3a3682619015ff6","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19665,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Boorman","original_name":"John Boorman","popularity":0.383,"profile_path":"/jMSpwdhkIsIGskwVE38Bdtazfy1.jpg","credit_id":"56f60a4a92514155fb001a9b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19665,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Boorman","original_name":"John Boorman","popularity":0.383,"profile_path":"/jMSpwdhkIsIGskwVE38Bdtazfy1.jpg","credit_id":"59476e83c3a368171b0352e8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19665,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Boorman","original_name":"John Boorman","popularity":0.383,"profile_path":"/jMSpwdhkIsIGskwVE38Bdtazfy1.jpg","credit_id":"5ae7ce6e9251410d2000eb7f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1835628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jocelyne West","original_name":"Jocelyne West","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae7ce8a9251410cec00f833","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63355,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Seamus Deasy","original_name":"Seamus Deasy","popularity":0.1206,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e360f3a091e620d164dbbef","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0114755","wikidata_id":"Q7859136","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":878,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/izRqZ4MV2581AZLniSRvJKZ49WP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":586}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
