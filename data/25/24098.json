Babes and the Slasher of Zombietown","overview":"Different groups of OC stereotypes are trapped in a bar due to a recent zombie outbreak. Little do they know that the Orange County Slasher who has been killing people all week is trapped inside with them. OC Babes and the Slasher of Zombietown is a horror/comedy that starts off when Sean and Ed (if you caught that one this is right up your alley) go out to a bar for the first time for Sean's 21st birthday. There, they meet Madison (the b****), Savannah (the slut), Megan (the hot nerd), Lindsey (the hot edgy nerd), Ashley and Michelle (the porn stars) Mike and Bret (the bro jock guys) and a couple of old barfly skanks and some surfer chick. The night seems like any other for Sean and Ed; filled with rejection. That is until a half eaten woman runs into the bar and warns them about zombies outside. Once they lock the bar up they start dropping like flies.","popularity":0.1749,"poster_path":"/kCueIQjTtp33gwHL2NIyQf3Ow9V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4708,"logo_path":"/k1zjOZ0GIZ1dxGerINlXC3lGAqh.png","name":"Brain Damage Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Zombies of Orange County are Trapped by Zombies From Orange County","title":"O.C.
