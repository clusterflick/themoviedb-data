Curiosity piqued, you take it home and pop it in. What starts off as two men screwing around with a video camera quickly transforms into an ultra-realistic torture sequence where the unidentified psychopaths tape their exploits as they torment and violate a woman tied to a chair. The devastation of your morals continues throughout the entirety of the footage, while subtly revealing the killer's shattered pasts via the interaction with their victims and each other. The most shockingly realistic portrait of a serial killer's existence is, Fred Vogel's AUGUST UNDERGROUND.","popularity":1.7209,"poster_path":"/4zdKBTOl4I6fOcXNWeecT0RXpLB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14780,"logo_path":null,"name":"Toetag Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The sickest film ever made.","title":"August Underground","video":false,"vote_average":4.115,"vote_count":104,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"オーガスト・アンダーグラウンド","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Подполье","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Agosto Sotterraneo","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Août souterrain","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97131,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred Vogel","original_name":"Fred Vogel","popularity":0.3312,"profile_path":"/3Jh3izAzK5VFTGwI0IZRVIgAYPd.jpg","cast_id":1008,"character":"Peter Mountain","credit_id":"6048708c5f622b004468b2d3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":555129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kyle Dealman","original_name":"Kyle Dealman","popularity":0.0855,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1000,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe44acc3a368484e030757","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1034392,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Allen Peters","original_name":"Allen Peters","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1009,"character":"Man Behind the Camera","credit_id":"604870960102c90059d6359a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":555130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Casey Eganey","original_name":"Casey Eganey","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1001,"character":"Girl in supermarket","credit_id":"52fe44acc3a368484e03075b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":555131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Friedman","original_name":"Dan Friedman","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1002,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe44acc3a368484e03075f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3004902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"AnnMarie Reveruzzi","original_name":"AnnMarie Reveruzzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1014,"character":"Laura (Girl in Cellar)","credit_id":"604870d75f622b004468b335","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3004897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexa Iris","original_name":"Alexa Iris","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1010,"character":"Hitchhiker","credit_id":"604870a28741c4004606490e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3004898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victoria Jones","original_name":"Victoria Jones","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1011,"character":"Old Woman","credit_id":"604870b415c6360070001aca","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3004900,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron LaBonte","original_name":"Aaron LaBonte","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1012,"character":"Younger Twin / Tattoo artist","credit_id":"604870c04284ea005ae3650e","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3004901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben LaBonte","original_name":"Ben LaBonte","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1013,"character":"Older Twin","credit_id":"604870c8d18572005857bf1f","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3004903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erika Risovich","original_name":"Erika Risovich","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1015,"character":"Erika (Blond Prostitute)","credit_id":"604870e04284ea0079fbba68","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4829066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Randi Stubbs","original_name":"Randi Stubbs","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1032,"character":"Black prostitute","credit_id":"6693a885067c584f3e027319","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1181727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Vogel","original_name":"Stephen Vogel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1033,"character":"Boy in supermarket","credit_id":"6693a894af6359420d0272e8","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":103310,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joe Knetter","original_name":"Joe Knetter","popularity":0.0971,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1036,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6693a8c434d70e0e5c95aacb","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4829055,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John A.
