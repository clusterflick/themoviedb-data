He has his other loves - photography and model planes - to challenge him anyway. However, one day a car breaks down in front of his house, and a young mother with her 10-year-old daughter come in looking for assistance. The daughter is endearing and would make a terrific subject for a photo contest. As both the young mother and the computer operator studiously ignore the flicker of romantic sparks, it is only a matter of time before the flame either grows or is extinguished.","popularity":0.4865,"poster_path":"/c62TUbB3bbpgDQjXLd25t4toM9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Salt on the Skin","video":false,"vote_average":1.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Bohringer","original_name":"Richard Bohringer","popularity":0.3499,"profile_path":"/v6372ku0d2Y28zUJ7mGrwaNQ04g.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Julien","credit_id":"52fe4da0c3a36847f826b4df","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20080,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Frot","original_name":"Catherine Frot","popularity":0.5073,"profile_path":"/mLYcrvglYGoPEjwBB5jyUe2ku8e.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Charlotte","credit_id":"52fe4da0c3a36847f826b4e3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1161613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Clignet","original_name":"Anne Clignet","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Juliette","credit_id":"52fe4da0c3a36847f826b4e7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1161614,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yvette Merlin","original_name":"Yvette Merlin","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mère de Julien","credit_id":"52fe4da0c3a36847f826b4eb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1161615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabelle Glorie","original_name":"Isabelle Glorie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4da0c3a36847f826b4ef","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Galabru","original_name":"Michel Galabru","popularity":0.3315,"profile_path":"/f6uvYIfc6cgQkn713rViFXIUCn0.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Bideau","credit_id":"52fe4da0c3a36847f826b4f3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1161616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Bawedin","original_name":"Michel Bawedin","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Le Concierge","credit_id":"52fe4da0c3a36847f826b4f7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1161617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liliane Becker","original_name":"Liliane Becker","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Mamy","credit_id":"52fe4da0c3a36847f826b4fb","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1161618,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Cleven","original_name":"Harry Cleven","popularity":0.1041,"profile_path":"/dYVRKzN9mSUMaE1UJx8FD9gUh5x.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Jean-Claude","credit_id":"52fe4da0c3a36847f826b4ff","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1161608,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jean-Marie Degèsves","original_name":"Jean-Marie Degèsves","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4da0c3a36847f826b4d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1161608,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jean-Marie Degèsves","original_name":"Jean-Marie Degèsves","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4da0c3a36847f826b4db","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3540,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Raoul Coutard","original_name":"Raoul Coutard","popularity":0.2518,"profile_path":"/fEwMCINuiSOu4f3CzHG3UL0BNIc.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4da0c3a36847f826b505","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0258538","wikidata_id":"Q3040418","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.736,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/WcIa67XH0D0LKbbWSdWkjHuzdt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":736},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/c62TUbB3bbpgDQjXLd25t4toM9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
