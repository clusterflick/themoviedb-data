This is a richly enjoyable exploration of the life of a born performer with some great archive footage and rare photographs. A highly successful career on the London stage was put on hold when Bette discovered gay liberation. But out of a gay drag commune in Notting Hill, Bette fashioned a glorious theatre troupe Bloolips, bringing together a unique blend of costume, camp and musical theatre leavened with sexual politics. The film offers an insight into a passionate and gifted actor who has made a great contribution to gay life, art and politics.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/80ek7cMq2a0791A0pjsiGGbgqND.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bette Bourne: It Goes with the Shoes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1162704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bette Bourne","original_name":"Bette Bourne","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"himself","credit_id":"52fe4da4c3a36847f826c445","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":217595,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Ravenhill","original_name":"Mark Ravenhill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"himself","credit_id":"52fe4da4c3a36847f826c449","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":575870,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeremy Jeffs","original_name":"Jeremy Jeffs","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4da4c3a36847f826c43b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930954,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sam Watts","original_name":"Sam Watts","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4da4c3a36847f826c441","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":217595,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Ravenhill","original_name":"Mark Ravenhill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4da4c3a36847f826c44f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":217595,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Ravenhill","original_name":"Mark Ravenhill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4da4c3a36847f826c455","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2770820","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/80ek7cMq2a0791A0pjsiGGbgqND.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1536}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bette Bourne: It Goes With The Shoes - trailer","key":"IWwNqFMYH9g","published_at":"2013-02-28T10:42:30.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec707c3a368544800a466"}]}}}
