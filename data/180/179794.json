He meets a young boy, Laury and his mother, Sharon in the park and is quite taken with them. He gets a job-prospect letter, as a private tutor, and applies at once. His employer is Mr. Morley, a surly, sour, mean-tempered old man who informs John he is to act as a tutor for his grandson, who turns out to be Laury. Sharon, Morleys daughter had eloped against her father's wishes and was abandoned by her husband after Laury's birth.","popularity":0.3988,"poster_path":"/iS3rei1bvMyJ9YK04rxjz776rSV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16301,"logo_path":null,"name":"Invincible Pictures Corp.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1934-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Love with Life","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lila Lee","original_name":"Lila Lee","popularity":0.2627,"profile_path":"/2AiD7dau2Fhu8bE7x7vthdu9Ism.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sharon","credit_id":"52fe4dabc3a36847f826dc25","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dickie Moore","original_name":"Dickie Moore","popularity":0.1777,"profile_path":"/AfhuD2u9Rotk0S51qIVWqZOpprv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Laurence 'Laury' Applegate","credit_id":"52fe4dabc3a36847f826dc29","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Onslow Stevens","original_name":"Onslow Stevens","popularity":0.3669,"profile_path":"/gbDKyMLZx2Wrjv9uwAAJZjFw0Pv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Prof. John Applegate","credit_id":"52fe4dabc3a36847f826dc2d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claude Gillingwater","original_name":"Claude Gillingwater","popularity":0.1147,"profile_path":"/9AMgwHyCDNveG6AkQvp8hQN0xgN.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Morley","credit_id":"52fe4dabc3a36847f826dc31","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosita Marstini","original_name":"Rosita Marstini","popularity":0.115,"profile_path":"/jtD2rTijDxzt29QyDtySp3lRH7B.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Brouquet","credit_id":"53d4cd9fc3a3686b9400341c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120474,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James T.
