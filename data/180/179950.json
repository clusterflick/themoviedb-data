Theirs is an alternative world of wild parties, arrest and sudden death. This film shows a group most people would cross the street to avoid. It's a life which borders on the edge of society and the law, but one which is governed by strict rules and traditions. There are two faces to The Outcasts. One exists in the pounding of heavy metal music and the exhaust fumes of powerful customised motorbikes. The other lies in the day-to-day grind, where even Outcasts have livings to earn, children to feed and bills to pay.","popularity":1.9802,"poster_path":"/mS2IVXWVtDgmjuYc7ZEarNbgxj2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1985-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Outcasts","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89868,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Howarth","original_name":"John Howarth","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6506be37fa27f4014eb1920b","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1663716,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jane Val Baker","original_name":"Jane Val Baker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57a9b808c3a368739f005f4c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1162576,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andy Murrow","original_name":"Andy Murrow","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57a9c65392514138b100630c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1506637","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cerpZEQMl2IrPkMvfTvcpmoDze1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mS2IVXWVtDgmjuYc7ZEarNbgxj2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6951,"name":"biker"},{"id":9503,"name":"outlaw"},{"id":12192,"name":"counter-culture"},{"id":14735,"name":"motorcycle"},{"id":14736,"name":"motorcycle gang"},{"id":155215,"name":"leather"},{"id":155418,"name":"subculture"},{"id":209863,"name":"chopper"},{"id":257184,"name":"uk"},{"id":336412,"name":"denim gang vest"},{"id":341030,"name":"1%er"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1985-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
