Yet, he is ultimately absolved when French hostages in Lebanon are released. Political scandal in France: there is suspicion that the government had intervened in the case and to have exchanged the liberation of the hostages with that of Gordj.

Mitterand and Chirac keep lobbing the responsibility of the case to each other.","popularity":0.4296,"poster_path":"/kthLdkHQazZI03Dqlmxs8qhygTG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2012-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gordji Affair","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thierry Lhermitte","original_name":"Thierry Lhermitte","popularity":0.3227,"profile_path":"/50kQVqmD1XnGRlgTPsVRhECaRae.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jacques Chirac","credit_id":"52fe4dafc3a36847f826e70d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Duchaussoy","original_name":"Michel Duchaussoy","popularity":0.4662,"profile_path":"/5HuD9Y3hYUKgfomk93DMRS4G4pT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"François Mitterrand","credit_id":"52fe4dafc3a36847f826e711","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malik Zidi","original_name":"Malik Zidi","popularity":0.3638,"profile_path":"/pn4QUm8KfBJFu8xDteJnWH9yK0J.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Luc Delair","credit_id":"52fe4dafc3a36847f826e715","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Elmosnino","original_name":"Eric Elmosnino","popularity":0.2135,"profile_path":"/tBiMY94OLEUWbBaH7GJtAZ3TY37.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Gilles Boulouque","credit_id":"52fe4dafc3a36847f826e719","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Marcon","original_name":"André Marcon","popularity":0.1901,"profile_path":"/tQFEk49npJO1XHh4OfSAjCfQTIz.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Charles Pasqua","credit_id":"52fe4dafc3a36847f826e71d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":32503,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pierre Trividic","original_name":"Pierre Trividic","popularity":0.0615,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Jean Baptiste Raymond","credit_id":"52fe4dafc3a36847f826e721","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olivier Rabourdin","original_name":"Olivier Rabourdin","popularity":0.9796,"profile_path":"/r15C7VnXnyMJk8JyNQOJGaauiKA.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Jacques Dor","credit_id":"52fe4dafc3a36847f826e725","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Spiesser","original_name":"Jacques Spiesser","popularity":0.2419,"profile_path":"/92UQ3TpFDflsbUg9cekjYjYDQyl.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Edouard Balladur","credit_id":"52fe4dafc3a36847f826e729","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3614,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Houellebecq","original_name":"Michel Houellebecq","popularity":0.1358,"profile_path":"/a3B4ozB89GKrLJIabJgWsAvueVU.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"59e6f30fc3a368131b008768","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17623,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guillaume Nicloux","original_name":"Guillaume Nicloux","popularity":0.2523,"profile_path":"/A6TghvAkrZGJoitxVQbVp5oD7CU.jpg","credit_id":"54e06711c3a3684551005808","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1863300","wikidata_id":"Q3201504","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2172,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kthLdkHQazZI03Dqlmxs8qhygTG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1536}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
