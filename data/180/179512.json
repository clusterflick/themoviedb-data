He is Moses, a man of enormous faith who, despite Pharoah's scorn, knows he bears the power of a greater kingdom: God's. Thus begins a titanic struggle between two determined men, with Moses calling down increasingly destructive plagues upon the Egyptians. The story's thrilling climax finds Moses and his people facing an angry army and a deep sea.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moses","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
