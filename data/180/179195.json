Born in Australia, he sees himself as an Asian citizen rather than a Westerner. His artistic contribution to the films of Wong Kar-wai, Zhang Jimou and Fruit Chan films, among others, is indisputable. Filmed in DV and Super8, this documentary is a kind of wild and stylized road movie -- from Bangkok to Hong Kong, via New York. The camera follows this eccentric and outrageous artist as he gives us his thoughts on his past and present work. From the recent sets of Invisible Waves by Thailand's Pen ek Ratanaruang, and M. Night Shyamalan's Lady in the Water, to the locations in Hong Kong where he shot some of his most famous pictures, such as In The Mood for Love and Dumplings, Chris Doyle talks about his cinematic fascination for Asian culture.","popularity":0.5224,"poster_path":"/qiM4W0T0uSdtrtNmvutnx33k7tm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86197,"logo_path":"/gUTZ1JDzJOytALYfXtPJKI1MqGp.png","name":"Point du Jour","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2007-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Mood for Doyle","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1357,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Christopher Doyle","original_name":"Christopher Doyle","popularity":0.3773,"profile_path":"/dm2g37ak1EzIu1YViAwvZAvytlx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"582a1315c3a3683601037299","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wong Kar-wai","original_name":"王家衛","popularity":1.1967,"profile_path":"/wjNI9KM9qJSYZHxkjD4Pm81kfc4.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"582a13239251417b2103b1aa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21678,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier Assayas","original_name":"Olivier Assayas","popularity":0.3294,"profile_path":"/yNhxilJd1QPGf1snqLtesAD7Z6M.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"582a13309251417b2c03abbd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56865,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fruit Chan","original_name":"陳果","popularity":0.4401,"profile_path":"/j1Xktbs6M6kNIwaLUps9swSEdVs.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"582a13a2c3a368623f0173f3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45769,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wouter Barendrecht","original_name":"Wouter Barendrecht","popularity":0.1415,"profile_path":"/dPhqiiY3aKXGTPQ9y3VsZuzmHPL.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d00e6ab92514173ecbd46b0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":39126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bai Ling","original_name":"Bai Ling","popularity":1.5268,"profile_path":"/4NB0MRVFjwutFQCPy8kbq6MEFrb.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62c566dbb6c26400513ed525","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":57831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Mok","original_name":"莫文蔚","popularity":0.6623,"profile_path":"/b0scABsp11kvXx15RvolTUqucNm.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62c566e53e6f2b03321fa00c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5216,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gus Van Sant","original_name":"Gus Van Sant","popularity":0.474,"profile_path":"/kICHgrSh4eiICjz8piy9fTXIgph.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62c566ec3e6f2b0331ef5f04","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"M.
