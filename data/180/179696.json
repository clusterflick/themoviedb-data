The soul of The Auteurs and Black Box Recorder reconstructs the purgatory of his career in a hilarious testimony that craps on every aspect of the pop music business. Those on the prowl for public relations and commercial potential have come to the wrong place. Haines is a notorious party-pooper, a wet blanket at awards ceremonies, and a sourpuss-that-sulks-in-the-corner. To relate his tragic-comic saga, director Niall McCann organizes a perfidious puzzle filled with talking heads: Jarvis Cocker, Stewart Home, David Peace… (or, as Haines puts it: “people who pretend they have met me”), unforgettable quips by the disgusted composer (“To hell with the common people”, “Britpop never existed”), and a script that resembles Winterbottom gone punk: actors that aspire to walk in Haines’ shoes, frozen images, surprising turns, and historical tiffs.","popularity":0.0398,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2012-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Art Will Save the World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":932566,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Luke Haines","original_name":"Luke Haines","popularity":0.0551,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5802333ec3a368796800117f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1694858,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Niall McCann","original_name":"Niall McCann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5802334ac3a368796800118a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1694858,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Niall McCann","original_name":"Niall McCann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"580233519251417c560012c2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1694859,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gillian Smyth","original_name":"Gillian Smyth","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5802335dc3a36879e300105c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1694860,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Matthew Kirrane","original_name":"Matthew Kirrane","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58023366c3a3684d49001f66","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2445380","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Art Will Save the World: A Film about Luke Haines (2012) - Trailer","key":"A3H61oDvflc","published_at":"2012-06-08T14:24:48.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5802342f9251417c59001261"}]}}}
