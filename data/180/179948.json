The World War II documentary uses film footage, radio broadcasts, and period music gathered from archives around the world. Interwoven throughout the film are the compelling stories of the Jews of Europe - unforgettable stories of tragedy, courage, resistance, and survival. Liberation begins in 1942, when Adolf Hitler was still at the height of his power and the Allies began envisioning a cross-channel invasion of Europe.","popularity":1.6134,"poster_path":"/AiXOwkH2znhW0obpiq9JZoMhNQh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101283,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moriah Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Liberation","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Libertação 1945","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":127165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Boht","original_name":"Jean Boht","popularity":0.1258,"profile_path":"/g9njuopM7qIgALSxh2XT8IKzvWU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4daec3a36847f826e641","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Whoopi Goldberg","original_name":"Whoopi Goldberg","popularity":2.9831,"profile_path":"/wZKI7qcEIVgiHxeFtk3NuKt8URQ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4daec3a36847f826e645","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Kingsley","original_name":"Ben Kingsley","popularity":3.4493,"profile_path":"/vQtBqpF2HDdzbfXHDzR4u37i1Ac.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4daec3a36847f826e649","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6199,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miriam Margolyes","original_name":"Miriam Margolyes","popularity":1.3188,"profile_path":"/q73xMZveDogt3e5uFknWMExLIyH.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4daec3a36847f826e64d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Stewart","original_name":"Patrick Stewart","popularity":2.1942,"profile_path":"/3yExCGqCMfSOVVHdEYTJhXaTtFZ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4daec3a36847f826e651","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Hope","original_name":"Bob Hope","popularity":0.6383,"profile_path":"/4TNYeks5q1dNKszFxOmL4pCjEvn.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5fba7afd9a64c100419539a2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mickey Rooney","original_name":"Mickey Rooney","popularity":1.0004,"profile_path":"/eYuayEC3xhXQf3Z1Cy6AVMEcgZb.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5fba7b0ea097dc003ef5c368","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1146734,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arnold Schwartzman","original_name":"Arnold Schwartzman","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4daec3a36847f826e63d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24717,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carl Davis","original_name":"Carl Davis","popularity":0.1301,"profile_path":"/6DKmgez2sJ6FfQ0vkLEPUx2RGUQ.jpg","credit_id":"612cb1a32c6b7b002cd0d22c","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1002149,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Trank","original_name":"Richard Trank","popularity":0.0896,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fba7b529a64c1004295909e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":95181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Gilbert","original_name":"Martin Gilbert","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fba7b3e8ec4ab003c7a07f6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1084995,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marvin Hier","original_name":"Marvin Hier","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fba7b239a64c100419539c1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0110341","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AiXOwkH2znhW0obpiq9JZoMhNQh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
