In 1947, he set up a studio fitted with film equipment that was almost entirely of his own fabrication. He wrote scripts, built sets, and innovated new methods of sound recording and transmission. As an enthusiastic inventor, he produced and directed the first Syrian film with sound. His dream was to film and screen a 3D film. An ode to cinema, this documentary is a portrait of Shahbandar.","popularity":0.1008,"poster_path":"/6YzxugyxGVwfUClkf3kO0wjSjLk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SY","name":"Syrian Arab Republic"}],"release_date":"1994-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Light and Shadows, the Last of the Pioneers: Nazih Shahbandar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SY","title":"Nour wa zilal","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1083475,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mohammad Malas","original_name":"Mohammad Malas","popularity":0.0695,"profile_path":"/zdlJtebk2MU1ustdDx4zlQPiebx.jpg","credit_id":"5ae0dfcc0e0a267772005c23","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1344022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Omar Amiralay","original_name":"Omar Amiralay","popularity":0.055,"profile_path":"/8Fn3s1W6LKSwTNfUeLKekn5mbqP.jpg","credit_id":"5ae0dfb2c3a36821e1005f54","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1324623,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ossama Mohammed","original_name":"Ossama Mohammed","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/nW9N5bBkIXNAB6FvWOHW5wMBWXH.jpg","credit_id":"5ae0dfbfc3a36821e50061ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":761,"iso_639_1":"ar","file_path":"/6YzxugyxGVwfUClkf3kO0wjSjLk.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":515}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
