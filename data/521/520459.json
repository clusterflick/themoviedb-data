One of the horses is claimed by a rival horse-owner, Jeff Stuart, when it wins a claiming race at Santa Anita. Then Stuart learns that the horse will not run without its former stablemate. But neither Stuart nor the Warrens want to give up their respective horses. It is finally agreed that both horses will be entered in the same race, and the winning owner will gain possession of both horses.
