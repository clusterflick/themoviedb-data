Arkoff","overview":"Samuel Z. Arkoff, along with James Nicholson, founded the immensely successful American International Pictures. AIP discovered an untapped audience in the American teenager and proceeded to turn independent filmmaking on it's head as they churned out drive-in double features overflowing with misunderstood teen heroes, horrific monsters, reform school girls, and leather-jacketed tough guys. Many titles were notable for their spectacular poster art, still highly sought by collectors today. Arkoff, with his unerring eye for talent, helped launch the careers of Roger Corman, Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, Francis Ford Coppola, Jack Nicholson, Robert Deniro, Michael Landon and Dennis Hopper. Midnight Marquee, Longthrow and Alpha are proud to honor the legendary Samuel Z. Arkoff, a perfect subject for the FANEX Files documentary series.","popularity":0.2621,"poster_path":"/7nvAs9SoQIkFIax66NXOFJx2w9I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The incredible story of the founder of American International Pictures","title":"The Fanex Files, Volume 2: Samuel Z.
