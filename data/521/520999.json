He starts to struggle though, hitting a creative block, and he seeks ways to push through it. Looking for inspiration around him, he presses forward with his work, but the harsh, punctuating sound of a leaking sprinkler behind him leads to a terrifying realisation. - What he types seems to actually happen, and, unable to stop his hands, he starts to dread whether he is a creator, willing other worlds into being, or a character with no real choice at all.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/1myFt3VFG6HAoT7f98XsHv17hi8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am God and Severely Underqualified","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2031561,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melvyn Rawlinson","original_name":"Melvyn Rawlinson","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":"/2VWY7IH0lVeYtc5yWhXm1yVgtkq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Writer","credit_id":"5ae4bf92c3a3686e2600e6a8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2031558,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Theo Gelernter","original_name":"Theo Gelernter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae4bec60e0a266bd300bd82","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2031562,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ian Bousher","original_name":"Ian Bousher","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae4bfa90e0a266c3600c0a2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2031563,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Theo Gelernter","original_name":"Theo Gelernter","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ae4bfb60e0a266b9e00bd7e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5966478","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.719,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1myFt3VFG6HAoT7f98XsHv17hi8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":575}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
