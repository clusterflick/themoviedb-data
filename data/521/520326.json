As her dreams unfold in the liquid medium of the bath, she becomes the ‘eye’ of the story and her own body the object of its gaze. With a feminine hand, THE STORY OF I plucks Bataille’s central metaphor from its original context and re-invents its erotic vision from the inside out. The eye is the vagina, seen throught he blood, urine and tears, it looks at itself in a mirror.","popularity":0.049,"poster_path":"/8wEmDhIj72RUfHEWnDZv26upAma.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Story of I","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1581525,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jo Ann Kaplan","original_name":"Jo Ann Kaplan","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/vZfbKXWnKBjfYquBeRKbNbwducq.jpg","credit_id":"5adf348ac3a3686ae700c230","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.719,"height":1107,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8wEmDhIj72RUfHEWnDZv26upAma.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":796},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jbSN9Zb7v00GHXmtYQpkOa6Kho9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
