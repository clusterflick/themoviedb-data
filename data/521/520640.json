Maggie, an inveterate social climber, wants to join the prestigious Northchester Hunt Club, and sends them a check for the $38,000 membership fee. When Jiggs finds out, he manages--after a struggle with Maggie--to take care of the check. Consoling himself at his favorite bar, he's convinced by his drinking buddies that the way to make up with Maggie is to buy her a racehorse that is coming up for auction. He does, only to discover that a doctor has told Maggie that her sneezing fits are due to a rare allergy she has--to horses. Complications ensue.","popularity":0.1497,"poster_path":"/neTV8GyFOrziDbsRdRdk8tAHxl3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1949-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jiggs and Maggie in Jackpot Jitters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1196675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Yule","original_name":"Joe Yule","popularity":0.0707,"profile_path":"/qs9CI0Oxm3gGgt3LhUckntKuqs5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jiggs","credit_id":"5ae0f8420e0a267776007a19","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":164779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renie Riano","original_name":"Renie Riano","popularity":0.1278,"profile_path":"/cJ7JbpWddFgvuNC1cDghMFH4TOG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Maggie Jiggs","credit_id":"5ae0f84d0e0a26776d008171","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Beaudine","original_name":"William Beaudine","popularity":0.2333,"profile_path":"/3ZU7jfJuEBbJenUSXAX7DhqzTqA.jpg","credit_id":"5ae0f8299251417301007475","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2346840,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Lela Chambers","original_name":"Lela Chambers","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d1372de0e0a261e56ce09b1","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Hairstylist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2070999,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Harry Lewis","original_name":"Harry Lewis","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d08e30f92514163bab9122f","department":"Camera","job":"Grip"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2346804,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Lloyd Garnell","original_name":"Lloyd Garnell","popularity":0.0343,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d18bb90126ec30015110027","department":"Lighting","job":"Gaffer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0041516","wikidata_id":"Q16252042","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/neTV8GyFOrziDbsRdRdk8tAHxl3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1949-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
