Keefe steals Barrington's papers and forges a bill of sale to himself for Barrington's stable of race horses back east. The stable includes the prize filly, Wildfire. Meanwhile, Barrington's daughters, Henrietta and Myrtle, are becoming worried about their father's long absence in the West. John Garrison, the sheriff of the town in which Barrington was killed, goes East to investigate. He suspects Keefe (now called John Duffy) and begins to build a case, causing Henrietta to become suspicious. Keefe, realizing that the game is almost up, tries to get Wildfire's jockey to throw the big race, but Henrietta saves the day and Wildfire wins.","popularity":0.4229,"poster_path":"/d0dygjJq176kFTbcYg3yP5RGWZC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38293,"logo_path":null,"name":"World Film","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wildfire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2029945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Russell","original_name":"Lillian Russell","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/lqAfiQtApnph4w2trWa7oMTOQo5.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Henrietta Barrington","credit_id":"5ae106030e0a26776f00913f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lionel Barrymore","original_name":"Lionel Barrymore","popularity":0.8391,"profile_path":"/ru11rLUzzLwKjR0ykTLkNIN9jcJ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"John Keefe","credit_id":"5ae1062cc3a368697d000003","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2133603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William C.
