One day, a woman who has been living by clinging to the certainty of the specimens rather than the uncertainty of reality loses one day's worth of photos… This film examines how recorded images can become more vivid than our original memories. Her mother's memories and her memories. Reality and fiction. These memories intricately blend together within private photos and videos, causing a complete picture of the faint memories to emerge.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/cd09fVdqjUt2upSRGCTCWLEx1vk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":164759,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tokyo Eizo Brig.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2017-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To find the day of 21st","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"21-Nichi o Mitsuke ni","type":"Romaji"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2028580,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kieko Ikehata","original_name":"Kieko Ikehata","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5addf464c3a368525800e868","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cd09fVdqjUt2upSRGCTCWLEx1vk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Burnt Video Art and Experimental Film Festival","release_date":"2021-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Nippon Connection Film Festival","release_date":"2017-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"Image Forum Festival","release_date":"2017-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
