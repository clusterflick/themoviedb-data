For revenge, Holten tells moonshiner Joe Lorey, who loves Madge, that Frank is a revenue officer. After Madge rescues Frank from Joe's attack, they go to Frank's home, where he teaches her reading and writing, and she rescues his racehorse, Queen Bess, from a fire set by Holten. Because Frank has nearly all of his family's money riding on the big Kentucky race, Holten gets Frank's jockey drunk. Madge, discovering this, disguises herself and rides Queen Bess to victory. She leaves for home unnoticed, and comes across the Night Riders chasing Lorey. After she persuades them that Holten killed her father years earlier, and was responsible for Lorey's attack, they chase Holten who falls from a mountain and dies. Years later, Madge's and Frank's children play at feuding.","popularity":0.3252,"poster_path":"/pnCpnRZhAc1Ow0aKTJwoiKJEcph.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1919-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Queen Bess wins","title":"In Old Kentucky","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1393409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita Stewart","original_name":"Anita Stewart","popularity":0.0875,"profile_path":"/kKJmhV2idh4ybNn8869HxsMO37y.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Madge Brierly","credit_id":"5d61bd8787f3f20017fd28a9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1196934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mahlon Hamilton","original_name":"Mahlon Hamilton","popularity":0.2635,"profile_path":"/jC8MQCyxxXSrNNyW7AvDGtu1GVI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Frank Layson","credit_id":"5d61bd8d87f3f20015fd276e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1350590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Coxen","original_name":"Edward Coxen","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/msS2eq5NpafWYO4W78SQIiVYS7s.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Joe Lorey","credit_id":"5d61bd936dea3a0011947b3a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Arling","original_name":"Charles Arling","popularity":0.1275,"profile_path":"/p45sSO9rmlCtsjoRjMQcTlAIMef.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Horace Holten","credit_id":"5d61bd986dea3a746b939050","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Connelly","original_name":"Edward Connelly","popularity":0.2155,"profile_path":"/zUTXrIDx9gjhiveMt8kXycDWF7V.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Col.
