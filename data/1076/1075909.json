Through the stuttering of a tearful camera, the director strives to renew, to the rhythm of blinking eyes, the memory of his father, clear in the details of a sweater or in the gesture of flipping through a book, but never in his full figure. Kundera, in a book whose title is nearly homonymous with the film (Slowness), wrote that «giving shape to a length of time is the requirement of beauty, but it is also that of memory». Paraphrasing another passage from the book: a man who, while walking, slows down is trying to remember. A man who accelerates is trying to forget. In the effort to slow down an image, this film seems to almost «recognise a sign of happiness».\"","popularity":0.1158,"poster_path":"/uYyKkXDFhO41d8AZF73BpcqJHaJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Slowly","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3862054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antoni Orlof","original_name":"Antoni Orlof","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/hAq6pWX4lA5qMIr3mFfGZ6bDvvN.jpg","credit_id":"6422b82d6a344800ef3110b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uYyKkXDFhO41d8AZF73BpcqJHaJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
