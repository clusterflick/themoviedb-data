On social media and for clients, Galen puts on a happy go lucky facade, while inside they're doing their best to piece their life back together. Encouraged by their loving coven mother to stop their antidepressants in order to connect more with the spiritual realm, Galen begins having visions of the future. Not her future, crimes that are about to happen. Everything comes to a head when Galen sees their ex girlfriend Katelyn being attacked. Will they be able to stop it from happening? Or will they see it too late?","popularity":0.0848,"poster_path":"/AuGnTYWoEWiMFc3k4Zi3hSlIJea.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sacred Vision","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3286269,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brimo Morales","original_name":"Brimo Morales","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"63c6b8da66ae4d007cb189f3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3840964,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackson Everest","original_name":"Jackson Everest","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":"/pFE5Hzhpnvge0He6FPSqY8S7F2L.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"63c6b8e2ea394900a0e094b5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1789728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Frances","original_name":"Anne Frances","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"63c6b8fe903c52008a878c77","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3350479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lauren Lox","original_name":"Lauren Lox","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/xtjVzlureRMlG59qrsGSiEURCXd.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"63c6b90c66ae4d0085cb76c7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3286273,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hristiana Soula","original_name":"Hristiana Soula","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"63c6b914c51acd00bdd5bc99","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3877662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Mahoney","original_name":"Emily Mahoney","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"63c6b929ea394900a0e094d5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3877663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chip Tamez","original_name":"Chip Tamez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"63c6b93460b58d0083a1ce64","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3877664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richie Kotwica","original_name":"Richie Kotwica","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"63c6b94066ae4d0093528cd9","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3877665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rhiannon Gragg","original_name":"Rhiannon Gragg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"63c6b949c51acd00916c726e","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3877666,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morgan Brielle","original_name":"Morgan Brielle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"63c6b958c51acd00cb40a398","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3286269,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brimo Morales","original_name":"Brimo Morales","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c6b8c2ea3949007db5bcf2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt19714380","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zWzZk6eFEXN2jzEppZFzmp1Idy5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/AuGnTYWoEWiMFc3k4Zi3hSlIJea.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
