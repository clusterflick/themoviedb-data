At that time, it was one of the most expensive films, as for the first time experts in history, ethnography, and literary studies were involved in pre-production. The famous Modernism artist, academician Vasyl Kryvhevskyi designed the film, and professor Serhii Yefremov served as a consultant.   Consisting of numerous short stories, the film that shows the life of Shevchenko as an adolescent, a soldier, a poet, was successfully demonstrated in Ukraine and abroad and became the most acknowledged cinema project of 1926. Amvrosii Buchma played Taras Shevchenko.","popularity":0.194,"poster_path":"/iaQHRUXIPoEs6NWfQ2q0j90MYVt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25065,"logo_path":"/ugfX3cgasxoDtUjkmWqlthK4hja.png","name":"VUFKU","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet
