Was SS General Hans Kammler covertly brought to the USA to safeguard his knowledge? Allegedly he had committed suicide on 9 May 1945. Yet, recently found documents contradict the official version. Kammler controlled a widespread network of underground production sites vital to the German war effort. But Kammler was not merely in charge of the latest state of the art weapons technology. The former architect and civil engineer was also one of the key figures behind the construction of concentration camps and the systematic employment of their inmates as forced laborers. In the end, he escaped being charged as a war criminal at the Nuremberg trials.","popularity":0.116,"poster_path":"/nK9RNHFo9KmLdkLG8gelsPZLgxp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hitler’s Secret Weapons Manager – The two Lives of Hans Kammler","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1615684,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andreas Sulzer","original_name":"Andreas Sulzer","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6561c6ad7dfda6592ee5a0f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1703063,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stefan Brauburger","original_name":"Stefan Brauburger","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6561c6a2244182014e890f72","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nK9RNHFo9KmLdkLG8gelsPZLgxp.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":816},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6SK2xCHrVbTjP3Q7jPoSagd3QDa.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
