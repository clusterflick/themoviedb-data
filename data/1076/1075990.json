My film takes the position that everyone is ultimately responsible for him or herself, and women, just as men, can be the cause of a relationship's breakup. The film's structure is similar to a television commercial, but unlike a commercial, the actor sells a point of view rather than a product.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"For Colored Men Who've Had Enuf!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3880163,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilene Sands","original_name":"Ilene Sands","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c866887a97ab00d3a6b358","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
