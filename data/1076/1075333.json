Foyt. Early in his own racing career, Larry would be steered away from the IRL and into the seat of a stock car.

This is that story.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Larry Foyt Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2460979,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brock Beard","original_name":"Brock Beard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c6b17466ae4d00c19f8e96","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
