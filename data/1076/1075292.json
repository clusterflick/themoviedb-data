Before her, film crews on the trail of the sailors who, in 1940, joined De Gaulle in England, had bored the islanders. The filmmaker found herself in a position of incrustee, in a state of non-communication bordering on exclusion. Unable to obtain anything from the inhabitants, but nevertheless involved in the environment of granite and mutism of the people, she filmed herself as a \"wanderer not integrated\" in an island, whose tendency to fossilization she thus reveals.","popularity":0.06,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'Île à ma dérive","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":51967,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeanne Labrune","original_name":"Jeanne Labrune","popularity":0.0682,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6465fe02c3514c00e5dbfc3c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
