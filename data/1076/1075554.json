Toraji (Ozawa Kazuyoshi), who rebelled against this dictatorship but was unsuccessfully insulated and expelled, is picked up by his uncle Ryuzo and joins the Takematsu Rengokai. Toraji recruits a group of local delinquents headed by Hiroshi Maeda (Yasukaze Motomiya) into his ranks and begins a guerrilla war against the Kanto Rikukai-affiliated Yoshinin-kai. The two expand their power, but Toraji begins to dabble in stimulants and gradually goes berserk. An assassination plot is hatched against Toraji, and Hiroshi tries to stop it.","popularity":0.6484,"poster_path":"/8hzWOJKUxRWVtwLuOICdzShzJQ8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Is the mad dog a friend or an ally?","title":"Jingi no Harawata","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":552027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kazuyoshi Ozawa","original_name":"小沢和義","popularity":0.7585,"profile_path":"/ckoyVwiNkEqaGEIYIp0vHtXOjW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"63c72920a7e36300c435fe4b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":548133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yasukaze Motomiya","original_name":"本宮泰風","popularity":0.7318,"profile_path":"/psL6KI2IktDBICsrEw4zKDKdnOe.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"63c7293241ad8d05ad97d50c","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2651549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuka Asami","original_name":"Yuka Asami","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/9UuHrrvT1aSlVTFIqoGvMaEmCoz.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"63c7294b20af770091baf831","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1795942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoshimi Tachi","original_name":"舘昌美","popularity":0.4344,"profile_path":"/cB5Qh9pApuaoE5OAbKV1FgzAbek.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"63c72975e263bb00aec82f45","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72455,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harumi Sone","original_name":"曽根晴美","popularity":0.5046,"profile_path":"/kEYcFnxCZvUNJ5yIALvDVwwgKYL.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"63c7299389f74900c70268d4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1204392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Junichi Kawamoto","original_name":"川本淳市","popularity":0.269,"profile_path":"/bI6OQyHAe23dpvinZ84ytQXL8S6.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"646240da532acb0119597098","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3747270,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Keiichiro Murata","original_name":"Keiichiro Murata","popularity":0.1578,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c729b620af770080db0859","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8hzWOJKUxRWVtwLuOICdzShzJQ8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1056}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
