For this, Sébastien Roubinet has invented a strange little boat \"TiBabouche\" capable of sailing on sea and on ice. This boat is a prototype brimming with technology and science, made-up by Hervé Le Goff, a CNRS engineer. It will allow Hervé to calibrate the satellite “Cryosat”, the first one capable of measuring the thickness of ice.","popularity":0.3437,"poster_path":"/2wSGIowoy8lu3n5BJJFoiR4nLu9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106009,"logo_path":null,"name":"Le Cinquième Rêve","origin_country":""},{"id":28968,"logo_path":"/f7Xz8CyAzM2t2srVhfPJ72QO5G5.png","name":"MFP","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2010-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sailing the North Pole","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2372335,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sébastien Roubinet","original_name":"Sébastien Roubinet","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/9WXmdSOT6FrbDDl0hNQoCibSAAQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63c7579e2f3b1700937f3a22","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3878826,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodolphe André","original_name":"Rodolphe André","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63c792422f3b1700baaa6d5c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1303845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thierry Robert","original_name":"Thierry Robert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c757c3c5c1ef00cb1c1855","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt24855062","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/hvAQFLN5hgxDa3tn3kQNdvLJXwr.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/2SYT5rJGWwty8PA83J7aZEyMdAQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j96CpMuRNmTgJRW5H40o8tzd910.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/cUxwYNuQ5arGY6FfWdKRNkYg2Sx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":1.602,"height":581,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/fJYR4OddqzJcV1mA6kidtyWyO3m.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":931}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2400,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/2wSGIowoy8lu3n5BJJFoiR4nLu9.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/r5lqGcra1R1RhjghnkiDDdEfrtZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/ufkKSGJCF9QzG4J4CaSwkZ4IFRi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":34154,"name":"north pole"},{"id":288649,"name":"arctic"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
