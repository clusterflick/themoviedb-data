The film settles upon this man, finally, discovering as one might, as a visitor, a pain in a face, the limp pajama over a stump of a leg, the cinches, straps, buckles of prostheses, his happiness and pride, one marvels. Camhi's film manner is without cuteness. Images seemingly are made from whatever vantage point is possible, not from a preconceived angle. Flash frames, light-struck ends are kept if the image beneath is worthy. For it is the image and its information not the style that matters, without sentiment, silently.\" â€“ Anthony Bannon","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bellevue Film","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2691179,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gail Camhi","original_name":"Gail Camhi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c743c9142ef100dacf0fc9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
