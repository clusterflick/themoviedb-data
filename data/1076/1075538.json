The title character and protagonist was Dick Spanner, a robotic private detective who works cases in a futuristic urban setting. The show made frequent use of puns and visual gags. Produced by Thunderbirds creator Gerry Anderson, the series was created and written by Terry Adlam, who had previously worked on effects for Anderson's Terrahawks. It was also the basis for the Anderson-created Tennents Pilsner advertising campaign using the Lou Tennent character (voiced by Vivian Stanshall).","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/7BypSLujr83LU3p6zn8ZbVJA7rQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1987-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dick Spanner P.I.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2689233,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Terry Adlam","original_name":"Terry Adlam","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c70f43e263bb00d346a6d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7BypSLujr83LU3p6zn8ZbVJA7rQ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/u4qEg5aC7cDrIrqdUaMFt2LF8jw.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sxbzRI1NPHHkTkLaa0YS4pDEaj.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1987-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
