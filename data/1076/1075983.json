The process is complicated; cruel, yet caring, beautiful and grotesque. The result– a hand, let us say, whose missing thumb is now a toe– is at one and the same time magnificent in its revobered grave and monstrous in its form. Looking at such an image, we must question all 'natural' sentiment and aethetic 'givens,' for Zdravic's film has shown us the deeper beauties of imperfection.\" -Dick Blau","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anastomosis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2083637,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrej Zdravič","original_name":"Andrej Zdravič","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c861d2c5c1ef00825b2d07","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
