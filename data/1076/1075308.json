Sohappy became a symbol of resistance for indigenous people of the United States and beyond. RIVER PEOPLE uses Sohappy's case to explore the historic controversy over fishing rights and the right to religious freedom. Behind the controversy is a story of a man caught in a conflict between two cultures and two seemingly irreconcilable ways of looking at the world.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"River People: Behind the Case of David Sohappy","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3877566,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michele Zaccheo","original_name":"Michele Zaccheo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c6a696ea394900c81b2a2a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3877565,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michal Conford","original_name":"Michal Conford","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c6a6b560b58d0083a1c684","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3877566,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michele Zaccheo","original_name":"Michele Zaccheo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c6a6a9903c520082d937e5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3877565,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michal Conford","original_name":"Michal Conford","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c6a681903c52007af722ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0411808","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
