Montages of color move rapidly with a star and the edge of a lighted moon briefly visible. Purgation is back to full frame; blurs of color occasionally slow down then freeze. From time to time, an image, such as a window or a face, is distinguishable for a moment. In \"existence is song,\" colors swirl then flash in and out of view. Behind the vivid colors are momentary glimpses of volcanic activity.","popularity":0.2381,"poster_path":"/4Bl7aXAbv1peLt8NkmUr5vfkVCs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dante Quartet","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":57,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Brakhage","original_name":"Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ad9c3a368484e16a3e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0092828","wikidata_id":"Q7728885","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rt9ZfmtN7jboK62obcd9e90cd8p.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5hPoSE8EgGFKWtk0HMpHUDu0jxj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oLifLHzKLMldEHfUeIa6pseg6fT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4Bl7aXAbv1peLt8NkmUr5vfkVCs.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2986,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ksbFIgArZSlhrVxvh5aaSg0ZRe0.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1991},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":872,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nL1QqfMkF67lbC1navu6ZrRy2Or.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":581},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1146,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7OXhZHuwIvc13vGJPVoXnszBb9S.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":764},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kMK85rqJtmFkS8jIVbOE8xhcd35.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dzU5i1uOX2xEEi1zWVk7L95d0jh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1932,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ab3ctWDQ954KQ0QttG59y1ryVmp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1288},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uHqMimvDDKRF8BqCtFdgPxowf5V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hMrIrOHYSytle064itVmIQIiKFO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2915,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jqlzuisc0bEZ5krBHxdC7n1LNED.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1943},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2915,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ljCsbrFtCyMmIU2NNBumniAFmUu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1943},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1146,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hXXxn6o4XniPTWiC3XhTwQlmlfe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":764}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"San Francisco Cinematheque","release_date":"1987-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
