Their families are struggling, their homes are physically unstable and everyone they know has dropped out of school. When a big-top circus tent suddenly appears in a nearby parking lot, they decide to take a chance. They learn trapeze, acrobatics, juggling and contortion, then audition for the end-of-year show, rehearse and prepare for the curtains to part on opening night. Along the way, WITHOUT A NET explores the connections between risk, desire, poverty and circus, and celebrates the perseverance of youth in the face of tremendous odds.","popularity":0.0582,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Without A Net","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1082706,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kelly Richardson","original_name":"Kelly Richardson","popularity":0.2128,"profile_path":"/bmJCX8WnIH6wrwFfTrSr8QtQu8T.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4adfc3a368484e16b813","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2331159","wikidata_id":"Q8028277","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
