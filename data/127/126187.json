Children hold chickens while an adult clips their wings; we see a forest; a narrator talks about stars and light and eternity. A dog joins the hens and the family, while the narrator explains the heavens. We see a bee up close. The narrator suggests metaphors for heavenly bodies. Scenes fade into a black screen or dim purple; close-ups of family life may be blurry. The words about the heavens, such as \"The stars are a flock of hummingbirds,\" contrast with images and sounds of real children.","popularity":0.4553,"poster_path":"/iUyXNzihIgPjzZsR1vODFmJ1pQO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1974-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Stars Are Beautiful","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":22,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2279196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bearthm Brakhage","original_name":"Bearthm Brakhage","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/A8Mx5tPRGp3AMpeqYMyThflSFUw.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67eb1eda49700881fcfafb9d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1013947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Wodening","original_name":"Jane Wodening","popularity":0.0791,"profile_path":"/pWLBcc7Tn3RgUyN8fXGf8YoKmHq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"59de3c20c3a3686200090f5e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Brakhage","original_name":"Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"59de3c2c92514124cd08f1e8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1013949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Myrrena Brakhage","original_name":"Myrrena Brakhage","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5a237865925141032c0c230f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Brakhage","original_name":"Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ad9c3a368484e16a38b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Brakhage","original_name":"Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg","credit_id":"59de3c39925141252c08b42e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Brakhage","original_name":"Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg","credit_id":"59de3c3fc3a368624d08a345","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Brakhage","original_name":"Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg","credit_id":"59de3c45c3a368623e08b5e5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0278740","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AwoVqWneI1Y9cnMmfkMsZsFencY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r1QQhlgb3BIWK1FlPQNcuYewDx5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1548,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qbVeByW0yY44L70GpPj6F3Y467l.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1548,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/naioIjpfc8htJqgjyHB15a8gyyG.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iUyXNzihIgPjzZsR1vODFmJ1pQO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2400,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7ZjVBJPrM2wdp0eJc4zlMuXYoj0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1548,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ohkQAvSRKQWO6sYngwWomhOLtgF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10887,"name":"home movie footage"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Museum Of Contemporary Art Chicago","release_date":"1974-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
