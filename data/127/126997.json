Over the next three years, some 30,000 managed to emigrate to the United States, settling mainly in New York City. In Austrian filmmaker Egon Humer's brilliant and moving documentary EMIGRATION N.Y., twelve Viennese Jews -- seven women, five men -- recount their lives as children in Austria, as emigrants, as New Yorkers. Deceptively simple in style, the film gathers striking emotional power as its subjects (who include Amos Vogel, co-founder of the New York Film Festival) offer fresh and often surprising views on their experience of exile and assimilation.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/2LHlMV5aU4ZuNuliRNNJbnlqHhg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46296,"logo_path":null,"name":"Prisma Film","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Emigration N.Y.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","title":"Emigration","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1083462,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Egon Humer","original_name":"Egon Humer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4aecc3a368484e16e1df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1083462,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Egon Humer","original_name":"Egon Humer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4aecc3a368484e16e1e5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1076685,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Amos Vogel","original_name":"Amos Vogel","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6009ad4898f1f1003eea1ad9","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":48789,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Karina Ressler","original_name":"Karina Ressler","popularity":0.1073,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6009ad57fb3f61005145172b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240483,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bruno Pisek","original_name":"Bruno Pisek","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6009ad603f8ede0042605270","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1530201,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Seeber","original_name":"Michael Seeber","popularity":0.1402,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6009ad6b41ad8d0040907784","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69908,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Heinz Stussak","original_name":"Heinz Stussak","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6009ad7341ad8d004191304e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238551,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Peter Roehsler","original_name":"Peter Roehsler","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/4fb3An7zH7MGvjQMQgwVpcT6x5J.jpg","credit_id":"601923ab1b70ae003c67ba1e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0116402","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":897,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2LHlMV5aU4ZuNuliRNNJbnlqHhg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":597}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
