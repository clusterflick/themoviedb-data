Sheltered heiress Maud Ruthyn's troubles begin when her father hires a new governess. Madame De La Rougierre (played with considerable relish by Jane Lapotaire) is a cruel, brandy-swigging schemer with an unhealthy interest in Maud's inheritance and an approach to childcare that would make Mary Poppins faint. When Maud's father dies she has no choice but to live with her wicked uncle Silas, who will inherit the family fortune if Maud should happen to die. This is not a recipe for domestic bliss and soon it seems that everyone but Maud is either bad, mad, or both.","popularity":1.3575,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":148,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dark Angel","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Uncle Silas","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter O'Toole","original_name":"Peter O'Toole","popularity":1.351,"profile_path":"/bk2AIN5yjqkthDUxUH0Q4U2ekRH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Uncle Silas Ruthyn","credit_id":"52fe4ae1c3a368484e16bcf7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":18021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Lapotaire","original_name":"Jane Lapotaire","popularity":0.3149,"profile_path":"/rPfQ7JUguavBCmuxvDcpbe1cxrX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Madame de la Rougierre","credit_id":"52fe4ae1c3a368484e16bcfb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":53515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beatie Edney","original_name":"Beatie Edney","popularity":0.7026,"profile_path":"/9J6ZfBnUPcP0msnyiNc14SKOhrt.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Maud Ruthyn","credit_id":"60f88ca8944a570075d83c10","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":101478,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Shelley","original_name":"Barbara Shelley","popularity":0.39,"profile_path":"/18AhTM7dfnMkO7O6gvQoxKRKo5c.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Cousin Monica","credit_id":"60f88cb8f1759c005f36d18c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Shepherd","original_name":"Simon Shepherd","popularity":0.3577,"profile_path":"/ok3v0YQE7kpMl2PcYE5IZ5XO3JO.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Captain Oakley","credit_id":"52fe4ae1c3a368484e16bd05","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy Rolfe","original_name":"Guy Rolfe","popularity":0.2907,"profile_path":"/u9hAhsWEo6gX8pVmp9LJE5zk57Z.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dr. Bryerly","credit_id":"60f88cc739a1a60082004b9b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27659,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Woodward","original_name":"Tim Woodward","popularity":0.4262,"profile_path":"/zxPCPmDkVxUI1qoeeK7lqrgdXVJ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Dudley Ruthyn","credit_id":"60f88ce1f056d500756af7bf","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1405866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norma Shebbeare","original_name":"Norma Shebbeare","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Mary Quince","credit_id":"60f88cf0df857c005eababb1","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcus Gilbert","original_name":"Marcus Gilbert","popularity":0.3505,"profile_path":"/h3djDOkNHLwep1fwbGbEhT5c6dz.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Lord Carysbroke","credit_id":"60f88d18df857c0075c43ca0","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":201648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patti Love","original_name":"Patti Love","popularity":0.2189,"profile_path":"/nsXZ5Hix3ZF42Q6ysj4m2y46HlE.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Peg Hawkes","credit_id":"60f88d24d7fbda0045150920","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Conrad Phillips","original_name":"Conrad Phillips","popularity":0.251,"profile_path":"/3YnzOo8nXweKyzbQ5LkEcMjE51z.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Dickon Hawkes","credit_id":"60f88d39c439c00029eb936a","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1313602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hilary Sesta","original_name":"Hilary Sesta","popularity":0.1235,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Lucy Wyatt","credit_id":"60f88d493103250072a896fa","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1047752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan MacNaughtan","original_name":"Alan MacNaughtan","popularity":0.2437,"profile_path":"/n8DNmlMwSqWXtOHvRvEUe6mxj9I.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Austin Ruthyn","credit_id":"60f88db8e24b930048ee09e8","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1407894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Baker","original_name":"John Baker","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Old Giles","credit_id":"60f88ddc960331002ea8d2cf","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte Coleman","original_name":"Charlotte Coleman","popularity":0.3382,"profile_path":"/R5RxaKkveZrwRW2DatqIWr9pmH.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Millie Ruthyn","credit_id":"60f88decd7fbda0045150b0c","order":14},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1220334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Crocker","original_name":"John Crocker","popularity":0.2338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Rev.
