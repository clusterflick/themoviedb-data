Especially difficult about the 'Pillar' is an extreme overhang, which even Hias Holleis’ sons Toni and Franz haven’t been able to climb. Since Hias wants to prevent his village becoming the laughing stock of Tyrol -which no doubt will be the case if the strangers are able to climb what the locals can’t- he dares both his sons to try the climb again.","popularity":0.1795,"poster_path":"/zYgm9CiUgY5pvSpwZPoyIOkqyiV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28938,"logo_path":null,"name":"Schongerfilm","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1967-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Da
