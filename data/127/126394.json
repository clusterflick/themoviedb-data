The portrait of Aatons founder, Jean-Pierre Beauviala creator, inter alia, of the time-code and the light cameras used by the New Wave (in particular the bush camera specially designed for Jean Rouch) is centered around the basic plot introduced by two women thieves who talk as voice-overs, and whose identities will only be revealed at the end.","popularity":0.3073,"poster_path":"/zz4xymOgyAdG69SdSpOY4Mbemkv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11687,"logo_path":"/gW6YiDdhkySff27C0m4JXu30879.png","name":"Le
