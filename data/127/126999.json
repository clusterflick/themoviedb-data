Ultimately this complex portrait is a meeting of the minds -- where the past meets the present, where generations collide and where the boundaries of family life are stretched, torn and surprisingly, at times, also healed. Berliner has transformed a story of a troubled man who has sealed himself off from life's pain into a work of universal resonance.","popularity":0.3778,"poster_path":"/meEFVvwfDbcFeYDSDuLofUfnuar.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10943,"logo_path":"/9jd9RFYraPpPCz7rpqp5KhrwfAH.png","name":"ITVS","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nobody's Business","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":16,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Berliner","original_name":"Alan Berliner","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/jeAOgGFclevzsHg3te1OxSKP8Io.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4aecc3a368484e16e20f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1083465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar Berliner","original_name":"Oscar Berliner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4aecc3a368484e16e213","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Berliner","original_name":"Alan Berliner","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/jeAOgGFclevzsHg3te1OxSKP8Io.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4aecc3a368484e16e20b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Berliner","original_name":"Alan Berliner","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/jeAOgGFclevzsHg3te1OxSKP8Io.jpg","credit_id":"5fcb895141aac4003f73b32f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Berliner","original_name":"Alan Berliner","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/jeAOgGFclevzsHg3te1OxSKP8Io.jpg","credit_id":"5fcb8948383df2003e5a7aaf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Berliner","original_name":"Alan Berliner","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/jeAOgGFclevzsHg3te1OxSKP8Io.jpg","credit_id":"5fcb895c8261ee0041405940","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Berliner","original_name":"Alan Berliner","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/jeAOgGFclevzsHg3te1OxSKP8Io.jpg","credit_id":"5fcb8964dcf87500414232ca","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0117196","wikidata_id":"Q98548734","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9odivlAukoNGMBcQwrrYFh0tFMd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/meEFVvwfDbcFeYDSDuLofUfnuar.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
