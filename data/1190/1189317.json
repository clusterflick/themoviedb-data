Later on his way home, Carter buys a packaged meal of chicken fingers from the local corner market, where he meets a strange man working the till. That night, Carter is rocked by ass-annihilating gastrointestinal carnage. And the emergence of an egg; inside, a strange creature, which he names Xavier. Xavier quickly grows, and feeds even quicker. On the eve of his big date, Carter struggles to keep the beast in check - and the girl from being eaten alive.","popularity":0.1176,"poster_path":"/2bZ9Uqp7lUMu26B5zQEgeDmsJAS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128252,"logo_path":null,"name":"Starless Sky Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2023-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chicken Surprise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4313278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ciarán Volke","original_name":"Ciarán Volke","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Carter","credit_id":"65245111ab5e3400abe5335b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4313280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessica Morgan-Lang","original_name":"Jessica Morgan-Lang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Brooke","credit_id":"6524511e0cb33516f63b3963","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4313281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Hay","original_name":"Emily Hay","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Aria","credit_id":"6524512e74507d01395f5e72","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4313283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Collins","original_name":"Joe Collins","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Xavier (voice)","credit_id":"6524514074507d00e213d95d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4313286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Lee Meyer","original_name":"Francis Lee Meyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Xavier","credit_id":"6524514b0cb33516fd469607","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4313290,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert Zastre","original_name":"Robert Zastre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652451b5ab5e3400e1d4d445","department":"Writing","job":"Story Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2820897,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Connor Nyhan","original_name":"Connor Nyhan","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6524516f0cb33516f63b397d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4313289,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"E.K.
