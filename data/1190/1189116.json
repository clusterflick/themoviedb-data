His abstract steel constructions, often painted in bold colours, forged a new and internationally influential sculptural language. In the years since his fertile and diverse practice has consistently challenged and extended what sculpture is, and what it might be.  At the age of 80, Anthony Caro remains intensely active, working each day in his studio and overseeing every detail of an extensive retrospective at Tate. Preparations for the show are featured in this profile, along with many of his major works, filmed in Britain, Germany and the United States.","popularity":0.0331,"poster_path":"/j6U0GlvlBQuofWQ6Lb6vGri2383.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"theEYE: Anthony Caro","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j6U0GlvlBQuofWQ6Lb6vGri2383.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
