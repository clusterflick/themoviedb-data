The film’s diverse film subjects include a wheelchair-bound, paralyzed swimmer who faces fear by diving off a high pier; a Black man who was told by whites when he was 13 that “Black people don’t swim” (it took him 30 years to try); a blind man who tethers himself to a sighted swimmer; a woman with aggressive breast cancer who “swims to chemo;” a lawyer who reduces courtroom stress in the open water; and a young woman who communes with her late mother in San Francisco Bay, where they both swam together. Along with swimmers’ stories of adversity and resilience, the film’s marine mammals, birds, artwork, and a variety of open-water locations create a visual meditation on what it means to escape our abstract digital world in favor of what’s real.","popularity":0.3208,"poster_path":"/oYnF8ZGKjpGaxN1AQTEKzauSv5B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cold Refuge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1134304,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Judy Irving","original_name":"Judy Irving","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6740c2147b825e685b4e30a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1134304,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Judy Irving","original_name":"Judy Irving","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6740c2878337acae076de48c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1134304,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Judy Irving","original_name":"Judy Irving","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6740c2957b825e685b4e311b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1134304,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Judy Irving","original_name":"Judy Irving","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6740c29f7b825e685b4e3125","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27668766","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":1370,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oYnF8ZGKjpGaxN1AQTEKzauSv5B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":582,"name":"san francisco, california"},{"id":15058,"name":"swimming"},{"id":213899,"name":"bay area"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
