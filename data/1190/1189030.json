Held in solitary confinement under 24/7 surveillance, the guards did not know his name or his crime. They knew him only as “Prisoner X.” After his death, the Israeli government placed a blanket gag order on the reporting of the story. Until three years later when the prisoner was revealed to be an Australian citizen and an alleged Mossad agent.  This documentary, which premiered at the 2023 Jerusalem Film Festival, seeks to reveal the Israeli Government's faults, failures, and systematic silencing in the case; and delve deeper into the mystery surrounding the death in custody.","popularity":0.0583,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2023-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prisoner X","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1625021,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Avner Shahaf","original_name":"Avner Shahaf","popularity":0.0786,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65237893b3f6f50139333566","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2532114,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"David Franjic","original_name":"David Franjic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65237889ab5e3400e1d4247c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":967612,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hilla Medalia","original_name":"Hilla Medalia","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":"/68lHnt3NabSSIV42xDQhFfGhvs.jpg","credit_id":"6523786eb3f6f500ffede16a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3744814,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Amos Roberts","original_name":"Amos Roberts","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6523787bc50ad200ad85af55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":932223,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Erez Laufer","original_name":"Erez Laufer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6523789d0721660139ca42c8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28335225","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jerusalem Film Festival","release_date":"2023-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
