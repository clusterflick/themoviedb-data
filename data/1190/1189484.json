They followed the wandering minstrels across two continents in a savage ten thousand mile, seventeen month journey to the heart of the groove machine. Fourty thousand feet of celluloid later, the result is 'Welcome To The Cheap Seats'. A rock 'n' roll experience nestling somewhere between 'Slade In Flame' and 'Coronation Street'.  The Stuffies swap insights for insults as they discover Tartan, Polka Dot and Stadium Rock in a tale that captures the band on stage and off-guard. The ten-legged's adventures canter to a soundtrack bustling with old favourites, brand new tunes, and a few classic humdingers they wish they'd penned.  The film offers but a brief glimpse into the hurly burly, hussle bussle, day to day life of ordinary rock folk.
