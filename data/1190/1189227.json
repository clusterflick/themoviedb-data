All of his playful, engaging work is informed with ideas from literature, philosophy, ethnography and alchemy.  Tilson’s early work focussed on mass-market consumerism and politics. But he was soon disenchanted with mechanical methods of production and his art in the 1970s and 1980s employed hand-worked wood and metal in intriguing ways.  Shot in and around the artist’s studio in Cortona, Italy, this film was produced alongside Joe Tilson’s first British retrospective at London’s Royal Academy of Arts.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/641MNTpoa3zIOX5HUztFBML7xfl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"theEYE: Joe Tilson","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/641MNTpoa3zIOX5HUztFBML7xfl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
