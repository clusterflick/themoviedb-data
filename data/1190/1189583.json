Memories overcome her - she guides us through the highs and lows, her internal monologue serving as an apology and a testimony for why things ended the way they did. She confesses to having lost interest once things became too dull and stopped inspiring her writing. The desire for true, raw feeling culminates as she states she wants to get beaten up. Someplace else, Ezra is leaving a voicemail to Cass. As his emotions let loose, he reveals a darker side to Cass’s hunger for inspiration. Unsure of whether anything in their relationship was real, he wishes that him and Cass never met, and urges her to write about her life and back off his. With neither character's monologue reaching their addressee, nothing is resolved, instead painting a complex portrait of the incompatibility of Cass’s tendency to write about what’s happening around her, and Ezra’s unwillingness to simply be a character in her scripts.","popularity":0.3415,"poster_path":"/jM39F2DtJI8rCYqb7I8AwgbjY38.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United
