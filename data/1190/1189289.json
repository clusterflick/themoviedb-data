Ale Sirena restlessly wanders among humans questioning the present and the past: like Giuli who lost the last remnant of her tail, she is caught but immediately freed by the guardians of the Castle, where the destinies of many of them converge. In the meantime, Vero continues to leave from the various places it has reached. Lou Vent also reappears and, while he is absorbed on a cobblestone that he holds in his hand, he has time to make love with whoever he meets.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Interminabile illusione - Sorrisi asmatici n. 3: Dal nord al sud","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1132633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tonino De Bernardi","original_name":"Tonino De Bernardi","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/6t3K7VZymqWMpJKifzN6xEFlPqK.jpg","credit_id":"652438afb0040a00ad3d9c1c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
