The city finds itself devoid of talented poets. Consequently, the god Dionysus, accompanied by his slave Xanthias, embarks on a journey to the Underworld to retrieve the renowned tragedian Euripides and to save the city of Athens. Meanwhile, Heracles, Dionysus' brother, receives a visit from King Admetus, who is mourning the recent loss of his wife Alcestis.  Frogs is the world’s first (feature-length) film entirely spoken in Ancient Greek. Apart from some self-written passages, the tragicomedy is directly based on the following original works of Ancient Greek literature:  The Frogs (405 B.C.) by Aristophanes  Alcestis (438 B.C.) by Euripides  Symposium (380 B.C.) by Plato  Battle of the Frogs and Mice (3rd century
