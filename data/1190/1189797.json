However, they soon realize that \"perfect\" isn't exactly the best word to describe their devilish new man after strange and unexplainable incidents begin occurring. The pilot was inspired by both John Updike's original novel and the 1987 movie that followed.","popularity":1.7876,"poster_path":"/uhP6Z6nng5Ls2kEUCjINU9hdyeE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":210709,"logo_path":null,"name":"Boam/Cuse Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":1957,"logo_path":"/qIxtba5CbnJfHCA88czLfTNKW9M.png","name":"Warner Bros.
