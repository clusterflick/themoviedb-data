With this concept, a debate is opened, moderated by the figures of the publicist Toni Segarra and the 3-star Michelin chef, Quique Dacosta, a world reference of cutting-edge gastronomy. One of the vocations of the art is to create beauty. Paradoxically, beauty as a concept has almost never been used in conjunction with taste. Dacosta approaches each one of these artists to jointly mull over the question of whether avant garde cuisine is an artistic discipline.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2019-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cocinar Belleza","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4312716,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergio Piera","original_name":"Sergio Piera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6523f167ea84c700aeef479c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
