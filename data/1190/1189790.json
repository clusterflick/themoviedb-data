You may have guessed that it was the great Mt. Thor on Baffin Island, Canada (4,101ft), or perhaps even the Azeem ridge on the Trango Towers, Pakistan (7,400ft), both impressively large in size, but even these are dwarfed in comparison to the unlikely record holder.  Nestled amongst the lush hillsides of upstate New York sits a bluff of quartzite rock known as the Gunks. Regarded as the birthplace of American climbing, its short yet mighty wall stretches more than 9000ft... horizontally.  Established by Dan Rosanstein and Ken Nichols in 1987, the Great Wall of China route is a masterpiece of esoterica which traverses the entire wall, its greatest crux may be jug rash, bugs, and dog walkers.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/sCD0pzjz7VM3bDFirQpres5haBR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":210706,"logo_path":null,"name":"Well Good Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":210708,"logo_path":null,"name":"PopTop Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"One Dream.
