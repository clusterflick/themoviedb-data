The national instrument of Norway, the Hardanger fiddle is similar to the violin, though it has eight strings, four of which resonate as drone strings. The instrument is often highly decorated with an extensive mother of pearl inlay on the fingerboard and black ink decorations on the body of the instrument. “The Devil’s Instrument” was the name given to the fiddle by religious leaders in the 19th century to discourage its use. The documentary interviews woodworkers who make the fiddle, the musicians who play it and the dancers who spin to it against the backdrop of the gorgeous Norwegian landscape.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":"/17809WlFnMPXqLd26vOUJ1et6Q1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26277,"logo_path":"/uXqiWcZbtSG2G9cQ031fRl2V0gH.png","name":"American Public Television","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Devil’s Instrument","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4315154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benedicte Maurseth","original_name":"Benedicte Maurseth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"self","credit_id":"6525b6ba3a4a12013a2cd412","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4315155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olav L.
