Little Sparta is a magical combination of culture and horticulture, poetry and planting, philosophy and myth.  Ian Hamilton Finlay began his work at Little Sparta in the mid-1960s. With friends and collaborators, around a group of old farm buildings he has fashioned landscapes, streams, bridges, glades, lanes, bowers and more. Everywhere there are inscriptions and sculptures reflecting the artistâ€™s preoccupations: the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, pre-Socratic philosophy, garden history, World War Two, the sea and fishing fleets, time and mortality.","popularity":0.0663,"poster_path":"/95qFGmgfDN1eMgpAZe09RhSv9Qn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"theEYE: Ian Hamilton Finlay","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/95qFGmgfDN1eMgpAZe09RhSv9Qn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
