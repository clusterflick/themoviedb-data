The police officer's helmet camera runs for months on the evacuation missions in the ambulance called \"White Angel\". These are close-ups of a brutal war of aggression, to which the civilian population in particular falls victim. In the documentary by Leipzig author and journalist Arndt Ginzel, rescuers and survivors have their say. Looking back, they talk about the fall of their city; Marinka no longer exists today.","popularity":0.0781,"poster_path":"/35oJuz2dJRJSy50ZT4oqxyfFtyY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":210610,"logo_path":null,"name":"GKD-Journalisten","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2023-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Angel – The End of Marinka","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2306238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arndt Ginzel","original_name":"Arndt Ginzel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65247f5ab0040a011da6c3d6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4313592,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hans Henning Ginzel","original_name":"Hans Henning Ginzel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65247fe707216645b919ef3d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2306238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arndt Ginzel","original_name":"Arndt Ginzel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65248003fd630000e2018e87","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4313594,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Gerald Gerber","original_name":"Gerald Gerber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6524802d0cb33516f74463f5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4313595,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Stefan Eggers","original_name":"Stefan Eggers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6524805bfd630000c56992f9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4313597,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Guntram Schuschke","original_name":"Guntram Schuschke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6524808a0cb33516f5c6209f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4313598,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Annina Wolf","original_name":"Annina Wolf","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6524809a74507d00ac4b40c9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4313601,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Martin Kraushaar","original_name":"Martin Kraushaar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65248267fd630000ffcc48a7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29249710","wikidata_id":"Q122811143","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/35oJuz2dJRJSy50ZT4oqxyfFtyY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":725}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"16","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"@ DOK Leipzig 2023","release_date":"2023-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"White Angel - Das Ende von Marinka | Trailer Deutsch German | Ab 19.10. im Kino | DOK Leipzig","key":"F7odgXEbqS0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2023-09-11T08:00:10.000Z","id":"6524812274507d01395f69ec"}]}}}
