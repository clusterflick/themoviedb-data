The resulting films, collected here as the \"Psychedelic Cinema\" program, stand today as an amazing window on another time. Swirling colors and lights, clip art animations, cinéma vérité images of '60s youth culture and fashions, flickering candle flames and flowers in bloom meld together in fluid, dream-like montage. The films originally illuminated the stage for Jimi Hendrix, The Velvet Underground, The Grateful Dead, Frank Zappa, Sly and the Family Stone, Neil Young, The Who, Pink Floyd and the Hallucinations (soon to become the J. Giles Band).","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/fXjkyHXcWuzcEOPtEc0iZUY4b6l.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Psychedelic Cinema","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2917143,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ken Brown","original_name":"Ken Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6524523a07216645b8bf1190","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fXjkyHXcWuzcEOPtEc0iZUY4b6l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
