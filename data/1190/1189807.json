They redefied the conventions of the time and shaped the cultural path China has followed to this day. But, when the world around them erupted into war, a cruel twist of fate tears Ziyi and Wanping apart and plunges her and their five children into dire straits that left them struggling to survive. Walking in beauty, with a heart inspired by art and the love for her country and her missing husband to sustain her, Ziyi kept her family and her dreams alive in a nation ravaged by war and political strife. Until a miracle happened.","popularity":0.1151,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Swallowtail & Dragonfly","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3442720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vanessa Yao","original_name":"Vanessa Yao","popularity":0.1228,"profile_path":"/etQ19smeTPHEXObwRifTnf2qYUS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6526252dd399e601003eadc2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4315541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivian Dawson","original_name":"Vivian Dawson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6526253481383100fe3cc1ce","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1916225,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julia Jay Pierrepont III","original_name":"Julia Jay Pierrepont III","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6526251c07216645b4007aef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28512342","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
