The unsuspecting walker might think it's a holiday park, but the buildings are home to 138 patients, all wandering around in various stages of memory-destroying Korsakoff's Syndrome. Korsakov's disease is caused by severe vitamin B1 deficiency, almost always the result of alcoholism. One patient can do little more than stare into space, while the other appears to be fine at first glance. Wracked by guilt, shame, addiction and a destroyed memory, patients Kenny and Christina try to create an understandable and livable world.","popularity":0.1666,"poster_path":"/buJfmrJwq0ciqTw8OxESU1pyRki.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hazazah Film","origin_country":""},{"id":100462,"logo_path":"/24dhPKt8sDtfWfNs1rsVtskOwZZ.png","name":"BNNVARA","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Even Vergeten","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2587491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Smeekes","original_name":"Kim Smeekes","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e5c61ffe077a0185138433","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1913,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bU6BHK9IjHjpK0fRUADoKlt4Ndo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3400},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":776,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bDOxXc2mCe9EvS3iPw6jrH9FbCy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1380},{"aspect_ratio":1.782,"height":1425,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/95rsW58wr4jZCudgw8lprne6yZf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2540}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1425,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/buJfmrJwq0ciqTw8OxESU1pyRki.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":950}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7464,"name":"alcoholism"},{"id":10938,"name":"old man"},{"id":329573,"name":"korsakov"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
