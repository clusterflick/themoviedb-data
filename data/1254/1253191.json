Invoking the history of magic lantern phantasmagoria as an exercise in belief and perception, Relict considers the zeitgeist of pseudoscience, fake news, religion, and documentary ethics—all collapsed into contemporary cryptozoology. Reviving the lantern’s historical role as a tool for scientific lectures and adapting modern cryptozoological lore to handmade lantern slides, Relict wanders through histories of documentary animation used to visualize and legitimize monstrous creatures.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Relict: A Phantasmagoria","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1835328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melissa Ferrari","original_name":"Melissa Ferrari","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e33690fe077a01620e27ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ann Arbor Film Festival","release_date":"2024-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
