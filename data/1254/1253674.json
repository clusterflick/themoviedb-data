MORGAN tells the extraordinary story of America's last wooden whale ship and the incredible saga of the first global industry dominated by the United States. From her humble beginnings in New Bedford, Massachusetts in the year 1841, the Morgan sailed 37 world voyages - where this \"Lucky Ship\" survived freeze-ups in the Arctic, attacks by south sea islanders, fire aboard ship and a host of other stories, each of which had the potential to end the vessel's life.  Yet 170 years later, the Charles W. Morgan lives on, and after an extensive restoration project, is poised to sail again.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/srx6zCh8EQawr3TkbGTpujmXAkA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":222418,"logo_path":null,"name":"Telemark Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Charles W Morgan America's Last Wooden Whaling Ship","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4570454,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bailey Pryor","original_name":"Bailey Pryor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e47aa79ee0ef0185710fed","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4570454,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bailey Pryor","original_name":"Bailey Pryor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e47af41ad93b0163066095","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4570454,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bailey Pryor","original_name":"Bailey Pryor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e47b1c9979d2017cb25a0f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1832,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/srx6zCh8EQawr3TkbGTpujmXAkA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1299}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
