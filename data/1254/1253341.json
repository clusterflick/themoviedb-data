It begins and ends with film taken outside the walls, while the rest is videotape transferred to film of the prisoners talking about race, sex and religion, class, economics and drugs. Occasionally statistics are inserted, but generally the women show such a degree of articulacy and radical thought that what they have to say is explanation enough. A remarkably undated combination of political anger and collective tenderness.","popularity":0.1157,"poster_path":"/4yJCeCm5URR0AILLS08aEmlq6eS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We're Alive","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":936428,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michie Gleason","original_name":"Michie Gleason","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e38d742ac4990186ee8508","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3029491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christine Lesiak","original_name":"Christine Lesiak","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":"/njfpCWeRPUKetxYy01yWYdaLVb8.jpg","credit_id":"65e38d639979d2017cb0b445","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3403511,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kathy Levitt","original_name":"Kathy Levitt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e38d55278d8a0147bd79a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30427025","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4yJCeCm5URR0AILLS08aEmlq6eS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Filmoteca Española","release_date":"2024-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
