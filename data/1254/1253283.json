He is the father of the national wilderness system, wildlife management and ecological restoration. His classic book A Sand County Almanac inspires us to see the natural world as a community to which we belong. Green Fire explores Leopold's personal journey of observation and understanding and reveals how his ideas resonate today with people across the entire American landscape, from inner cities to the remotest wildlands. The film challenges viewers to contemplate their own relationship with the land community.","popularity":0.3717,"poster_path":"/cyIu3zlpGo5una3pkz8cF9nKzt4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107033,"logo_path":"/xSIJIErcNUobFmf3YPlE7J7GdXq.png","name":"U.S. Forest Service","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Aldo Leopold and a Land Ethic for Our Time","title":"Green Fire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Coyote","original_name":"Peter Coyote","popularity":1.5648,"profile_path":"/ld3xLYTcZWjAc0bE33DONT7n9o8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Aldo Leopold (voice)","credit_id":"65e36d109979d20149af4301","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4568795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aldo Leopold","original_name":"Aldo Leopold","popularity":0.1313,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"65e36d2a1ad93b01860686b0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4569707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Curt Meine","original_name":"Curt Meine","popularity":0.0748,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"65e3ce64498ef90164ed2b38","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4569724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Leopold Bradley","original_name":"Nina Leopold Bradley","popularity":0.0437,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65e3d0e3db72c0017cf67d30","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4569732,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Estella Bergere Leopold","original_name":"Estella Bergere Leopold","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65e3d21e1ad93b018607061e","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3472822,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ann Dunsky","original_name":"Ann Dunsky","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e36db92e2b2c0163b5610f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3472820,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Dunsky","original_name":"Steve Dunsky","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e36dcea672540185a97205","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4568801,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Steinke","original_name":"David Steinke","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e36de0db72c00163f55ce6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4569702,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Buddy Huffaker","original_name":"Buddy Huffaker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e3cdf120e6a501635124a8","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4569720,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Charles W.
