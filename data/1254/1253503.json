He's laying flowers for a funeral that hasn't happened yet...or has it? This is going to be one party no one forgets in a hurry. After Trick or Treating in the Deep South in the 80s as a sugared-up tiny ghoul, writer/producer Nina Romain has never stopped being obsessed with Halloween - which is why five of her horror shorts are about 31st October. Shot in the mean streets of urban decay in south London, this modern day take on Clockwork Orange sees the tables turned on Halloween revellers in a way you won't see coming. Lilies has been selected by Hollywood Horror Film Festival, Take It Easy Film Festival, MedFF, Aab International Film Festival, was a semi-finalist at the AltFF Alternative Film Festival, a finalist at Upstate NY Horror Film Festival and the Shock Stock Fest.","popularity":0.0651,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lilies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4569774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Greasley","original_name":"Claire Greasley","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Voodoo Queen partygoer","credit_id":"65e3df509451e70131597eeb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":139947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phoenix James","original_name":"Phoenix James","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Voodoo King partygoer","credit_id":"65e3df71498ef90164ed4292","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2527041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doug Rollins","original_name":"Doug Rollins","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e3df8c278d8a00c8bd56a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2208308,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nina Romain","original_name":"Nina Romain","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e3df969451e701875a0498","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14419896","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
