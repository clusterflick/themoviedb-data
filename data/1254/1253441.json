The main character is an unclean named Kuygorozh, a hybrid of an owl and a snake, one of the strangest characters in folk legends. A workaholic, he constantly demands work from his employers and does everything for them. Of course, every lazy person dreams of such an assistant. There are two of them in the film – an old Man and an Old Woman. Having obtained an egg with a Kuygor, they began to live a new life, but the joy of greedy idlers was short-lived.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/xhXzWcotw8d83Rg4Bl6hS60nJdH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77491,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio \"Pilot\"","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2007-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kuygorozh","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2184254,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergey Merinov","original_name":"Sergey Merinov","popularity":0.1017,"profile_path":"/gvTVvdsw04WiJ3knJenQKfhiGnC.jpg","credit_id":"65e3be2e1ad93b018606bcbb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xhXzWcotw8d83Rg4Bl6hS60nJdH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
