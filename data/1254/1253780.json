It was shown in several Hollywood theaters, such as the Encore on Melrose Avenue. In remembrance of the 4 students shot down at Kent State University by the Ohio National Guard 50 years ago during Viet Nam war protests, I am posting this film that I and my friends made at the time feeling something had to be said. After hearing the news, I paced around the projection booth where I worked, until the story came to me and I wrote it down in one sitting. It was my first 16mm sound movie. It was shown in several Hollywood Theaters as a short subject, and got featured in an interview on Headshop ch 52 with Elliot Mintz, who went on to become an advisor to the Beatles.","popularity":0.0478,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The C.O.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2241276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dean Shah-Kee","original_name":"Dean Shah-Kee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"The C.O.","credit_id":"65e4b9c22ac4990186f06884","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309070,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Munger","original_name":"Chris Munger","popularity":0.056,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e4b9e19979d2017cb2a9a0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2161254,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wayne Schotten","original_name":"Wayne Schotten","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e4b9d6b7a1540163792195","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2161254,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wayne Schotten","original_name":"Wayne Schotten","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e4b9ce2ac4990186f0689c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12269296","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
