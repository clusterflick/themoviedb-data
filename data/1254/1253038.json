Equal parts essay and visual art, Speaking in Tongues embodies the cinematic Black ecstatic that simultaneously re-envisions resistance defiance in the face of anti-Black state violence and subverts the conventions of cinematic realism through a manually and optically altered collage of original documentary and archival film sourced from Hollywood movies, television commercials, educational films, cartoons, European art cinema and miscellaneous ephemera.","popularity":0.6784,"poster_path":"/cMTXHWANnlPy9txeOWtGkCQaB52.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Speaking in Tongues: Take One","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1657916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Harris","original_name":"Christopher Harris","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/2KvTTk7mWbuAzseVYdRJCBUBR79.jpg","credit_id":"65e2e4c49979d2017cafe9b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1657916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Harris","original_name":"Christopher Harris","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/2KvTTk7mWbuAzseVYdRJCBUBR79.jpg","credit_id":"65e2e4cd2ac4990186edba7d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1657916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Harris","original_name":"Christopher Harris","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/2KvTTk7mWbuAzseVYdRJCBUBR79.jpg","credit_id":"65e2e4de2e2b2c0185b580d7","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":1316,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cMTXHWANnlPy9txeOWtGkCQaB52.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":890}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":190675,"name":"black history"},{"id":204154,"name":"archival"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
