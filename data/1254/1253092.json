It’s a perfect example of Tambellini’s wit and contempt for systems of power and capital. In true Aldo fashion, he assembled a group of local teenagers who wanted to learn how to perform as a barber shop quartet. He wrote a song for them to perform, split the commission, and created a public spectacle presenting both museums with The Screw—a literal “screw you” to the nihilistic institutions Tambellini called out for violating the ethics of artistic citizenship through their promotion of commercialized, mainstream, docile, and apolitical art work. Tambellini’s performance incorporates the poetic, the spectacle, the musical, the satirical, and the sculptural.","popularity":0.0322,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1963-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Screw","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1096213,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aldo Tambellini","original_name":"Aldo Tambellini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e30a381ad93b0186062173","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1963-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
