Before Division has a chance to order the mission, she decides to go rogue and tracks him down herself. As well connected as Vain is, he is prepared to welcome her. She tries to fight him but quickly realizes his raw strength is simply stronger than hers. If she can't capture and overpower him, she has to figure out a way to defeat him. Before she realizes what's happening, he begins to mentally manipulate her and she slowly falls into control. When Division figures out her location and orders the triggering of a capsule she carries in an effort to take out both her and Vain, life becomes infinitely more complicated for Wonder Girl as she begins fundamentally questioning her allegiance.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Chamber Part III","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":3397787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arielle","original_name":"Arielle","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/8egQC716SLYM0O2KGyXfkWKYPrd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65e4e8689979d2017cb2de63","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":3002305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Wright","original_name":"Allen Wright","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e4e87df706de0186c89fb5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
