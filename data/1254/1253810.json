Willing was fired from the nightly news spotlight but was oddly kept on as a street reporter. His firing was due to exaggerations, inaccuracies and utter nonsense. Network's CEO Mr. Leibowitz feels that his zany, ludicrous mix-ups in reporting has entertainment value and the high ratings prove it. Willing feels his glorious return will happen if he returns to the street and bond with the people – and even animals – in New York's Central Park.","popularity":0.3485,"poster_path":"/44PumlGoUYLHcUV70kS9nMShEPE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Return of Brian Willing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4570836,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anthony Aibel","original_name":"Anthony Aibel","popularity":0.1252,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Brian Willing","credit_id":"65e4c5dc9ee0ef01626fa85e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2931027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Parish","original_name":"Catherine Parish","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Katie Slater","credit_id":"65e4c5f09451e701875b1e68","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2839710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sawyer Ploski","original_name":"Sawyer Ploski","popularity":0.1261,"profile_path":"/ozQKoGgUhkDMgt4HEsUThMiKrMP.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Sean","credit_id":"65e4c5ff9451e701875b1e7c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4570838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Manukyun","original_name":"Nicole Manukyun","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Juul Girl","credit_id":"65e4c616c99826014860ab41","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4570839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharon Marie Pence","original_name":"Sharon Marie Pence","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"65e4c624b7a1540163792c0b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4570836,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anthony Aibel","original_name":"Anthony Aibel","popularity":0.1252,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e4c56320e6a5016351e1f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4570836,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anthony Aibel","original_name":"Anthony Aibel","popularity":0.1252,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e4c56b278d8a0185c14037","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2931027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Parish","original_name":"Catherine Parish","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e4c5809ee0ef0185715dbc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195150,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cameron Sawyer","original_name":"Cameron Sawyer","popularity":0.0858,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e4c592b7a15401867b50b3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35145,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adrienne Stern","original_name":"Adrienne Stern","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":"/vUTcBXvaKCLocGgbXKdwUlG9oa6.jpg","credit_id":"65e4c5a39451e701875b1e20","department":"Production","job":"Casting"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195150,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cameron Sawyer","original_name":"Cameron Sawyer","popularity":0.0858,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e4c5b1fe077a01620f5aa9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4570837,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sienna Santangelo","original_name":"Sienna Santangelo","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e4c5c49451e701875b1e42","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":968,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nyH2BRBMLgaln6m1JdRMHOQjV2h.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1720}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/44PumlGoUYLHcUV70kS9nMShEPE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11800,"name":"mockumentary"},{"id":157384,"name":"news reporter"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TRAILER: ‘The Return of Brian Willing’.
