Based on video shot by Olson of avant-garde musician and composer Ornette Coleman performing in Harmolodic Studio in 2003, the installation is less documentation of that performance than visual improvisation on musical ideas. Using six monitors, a wall projection, and large-scale prints, the installation presents graphic compositions created 20 years later when the video was remixed to the original performance soundtrack.","popularity":0.0595,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grafica Harmolodica","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3158313,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Olson","original_name":"David Olson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e338969979d20149af3aee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ann Arbor Film Festival","release_date":"2024-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
