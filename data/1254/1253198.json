On the island of Newfoundland, Canada, a man alone in his rural home awaits the spring thaw with the arrival of hardy plants, insects and birds. The film tracks his daily labour though the seasons as he builds, tends and harvests a circular garden enriched by the bounty of seaweed and fish that he gathers from the island's shore. His dedication to the earth that feeds him and his intimacy with his natural surroundings reveals a portrait of an unadorned purposeful life.","popularity":0.1314,"poster_path":"/ceMklXkZDjXkGAMWpD6KxkYiBc1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":222301,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nicola Hawkins Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2023-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A year in the life of Andy Perlis.","title":"Circle of Truth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4568480,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Perlis","original_name":"Andy Perlis","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Homo Sapien","credit_id":"65e33ec9e942be0187eaabab","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4566080,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicola Hawkins","original_name":"Nicola Hawkins","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e33ee1498ef90164ecdacd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4566080,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicola Hawkins","original_name":"Nicola Hawkins","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e33ee7e942be0187eaabca","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3397803,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Steve Cook","original_name":"Steve Cook","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e33f929ee0ef01856f6cf2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2166574,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Adam Foran","original_name":"Adam Foran","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e33f05c998260148605404","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4566080,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicola Hawkins","original_name":"Nicola Hawkins","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e33edb1ad93b0186065555","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2166574,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Adam Foran","original_name":"Adam Foran","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e33f0ce942be0131e9a6a2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3397803,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Steve Cook","original_name":"Steve Cook","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6646a1cfb0bccc5a09b360ef","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28082837","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ceMklXkZDjXkGAMWpD6KxkYiBc1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
