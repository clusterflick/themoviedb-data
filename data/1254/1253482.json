Strippers gyrate in comical exaggeration while a cheap night vision effect turns their eyes to vacant beads, more animal than human. Abrupt cut to green-tinted war footage—spectacular bombs and helicopter explosions splinter into streams of light for the remaining minutes of the video. An inane pop ditty becomes a haunting and melancholy rumination on sex and war.  SALEM strips the song to its bones and allows the lyrics to express new meaning.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/v0SVCaIC08N4exI0ZkA94Gohjyd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"SALEM","title":"SALEM - Till The World Ends","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.684,"height":835,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v0SVCaIC08N4exI0ZkA94Gohjyd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":571}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
