A bas-relief in the temple where she is entombed in Luxor shows them bringing back extraordinary treasures. But did this expedition really happen? And if it did, where exactly is the land of Punt?  Drawing upon recent finds, the archaeologist Cheryl Ward sets out to recreate the voyage, in a full-size replica of one of these ancient ships, sailing it in the wake of Hatshepsut's fleet, in search of the mythical land of Punt. A human adventure as well as a scientific challenge, the expedition proves that, contrary to popular belief, the ancient Egyptians had the necessary tools, science and techniques to sail the seas.","popularity":0.1475,"poster_path":"/7WzFiaCOAHFuDeI5ay2DBalSn6c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103020,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sombrero & Co  Mezzo   France Television","origin_country":""},{"id":6747,"logo_path":"/uLTkpA3dpMrGwBIDin8OByW39gQ.png","name":"Essential Media and Entertainment","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2010-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pharaoh Who Conquered the Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2819557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cheryl Ward","original_name":"Cheryl Ward","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator - (Voice)","credit_id":"65e318d0db72c0017cf5b9ed","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186423,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stéphane Bégoin","original_name":"Stéphane Bégoin","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e319012ac4990186edfc86","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":79099,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Hilton","original_name":"Chris Hilton","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e319349979d2017cb02961","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1408023,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Valérie Abita","original_name":"Valérie Abita","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e3195cdb72c00149f4ffdd","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3553712,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Flores Kosinetz","original_name":"Flores Kosinetz","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/mtqAIj4hiyQi2kZQSJWX0sAdoDJ.jpg","credit_id":"66e3e5c60000000000b987c8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7WzFiaCOAHFuDeI5ay2DBalSn6c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
