Thus, both cinema and radiography fall within the scopic regime inaugurated by modernity.  The use of X-rays on two sculptures from the Bilbao Fine Arts Museum generates images that reveal certain elements of them that would otherwise be invisible to our eyes. These images, despite being generally created for technical or scientific purposes, seem to produce a certain form of 'photogénie': they lend the radiographed objects a new appearance that lies somewhere between the material and the ethereal, endowing them with a vaporous and spectral quality. It is not by chance that physics and phantasmagoria share the term 'spectrum' in their vocabulary.","popularity":0.8493,"poster_path":"/i5t3DM6ReBKGdjWECTEGMFGUcaO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116099,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kleinen filmak","origin_country":""},{"id":222288,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bilbao Fine Arts Museum","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2024-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phantasia","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2000749,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Moneo Quintana","original_name":"Jorge Moneo Quintana","popularity":0.0764,"profile_path":"/jT8llY6g55Bil5R1n0eGLwaekMe.jpg","credit_id":"65e2f760e942be014be9bae1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2000749,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Moneo Quintana","original_name":"Jorge Moneo Quintana","popularity":0.0764,"profile_path":"/jT8llY6g55Bil5R1n0eGLwaekMe.jpg","credit_id":"65e2f772278d8a0185be40a4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2000749,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Moneo Quintana","original_name":"Jorge Moneo Quintana","popularity":0.0764,"profile_path":"/jT8llY6g55Bil5R1n0eGLwaekMe.jpg","credit_id":"65e2fc2da672540185a8d110","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2000749,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Moneo Quintana","original_name":"Jorge Moneo Quintana","popularity":0.0764,"profile_path":"/jT8llY6g55Bil5R1n0eGLwaekMe.jpg","credit_id":"65e2fc512e2b2c0185b5a12a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4568122,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bilbao Fine Arts Museum","original_name":"Bilbao Fine Arts Museum","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e2fc17278d8a0162bda69c","department":"Editing","job":"Archival Footage Research"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31531512","wikidata_id":"Q86424092","facebook_id":"@kleinenfilmak","instagram_id":"@kleinenfilmak","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/i5t3DM6ReBKGdjWECTEGMFGUcaO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11130,"name":"art house"},{"id":14720,"name":"love affair"},{"id":15032,"name":"gothic horror"},{"id":33505,"name":"gothic"},{"id":33513,"name":"desire"},{"id":41260,"name":"sensuality"},{"id":41404,"name":"sexual desire"},{"id":154866,"name":"archive footage"},{"id":156580,"name":"ghost story"},{"id":162846,"name":"ghost"},{"id":171453,"name":"art history"},{"id":196164,"name":"ghosts of the past"},{"id":204154,"name":"archival"},{"id":223380,"name":"structuralist"},{"id":223419,"name":"structuralism"},{"id":227202,"name":"structural film"},{"id":238875,"name":"audio visual experience"},{"id":246160,"name":"experimental narrative"},{"id":272583,"name":"visual anthropology"},{"id":274133,"name":"visual language"},{"id":275024,"name":"existential horror"},{"id":285070,"name":"no dialogue"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"},{"id":293118,"name":"experimental music"},{"id":293336,"name":"experimental film"},{"id":296071,"name":"experimental documentary"},{"id":296721,"name":"experimental animation"},{"id":297567,"name":"cine experimental"},{"id":305843,"name":"art film"},{"id":311315,"name":"dramatic"},{"id":319819,"name":"found footage film"},{"id":326395,"name":"visual storytelling"},{"id":327245,"name":"experimental sound"},{"id":328110,"name":"audiovisual experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Toulouse Cinémathèque","release_date":"2024-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Message to Man International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"'PHANTASIA'  Trailer","key":"850689909","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-08-01T20:09:35.000Z","id":"65e2f70b498ef90164ecbac3"}]}}}
