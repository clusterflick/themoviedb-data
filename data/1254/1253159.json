Many of these friends were important names in 20th century culture and thought. His house was always open to them, in a permanent celebration of the joy of living and the union between people.  Among these friends, three had special importance: Caymmi, Verger, and Carybé. It is the history of this friendship, which went beyond real life and penetrated art and the battle for the valorization of popular culture, that our project dives into. A friendship that became the salt of Brazilian life.","popularity":0.1084,"poster_path":"/42arkvdvWQiTvbjMBJLmaPXaIdl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114037,"logo_path":"/8Pgfxitzkghb4g1VqA3UWiaHA89.png","name":"Coqueirão Pictures","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":222293,"logo_path":null,"name":"Janela do Mundo","origin_country":""},{"id":13969,"logo_path":"/bEpiJ2zXGIH70JT16asjWNFtOEv.png","name":"Globo Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"O Sal da Vida","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102563,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Diogo Dahl","original_name":"Diogo Dahl","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/30ZzE9MttRTUF3epIrTr0bJ7mSW.jpg","credit_id":"65e32741278d8a0185be8558","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":10042,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sérgio Machado","original_name":"Sérgio Machado","popularity":0.246,"profile_path":"/hXf14FCTI2MwuoT48bHIo90pwOF.jpg","credit_id":"65e32711fe077a01470dc3c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/42arkvdvWQiTvbjMBJLmaPXaIdl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
