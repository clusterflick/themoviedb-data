Solaria witnesses a news report about a sexual predator named Vain and takes action. Despite having a few drinks, she realizes she’s near the sighting and pursues the villain. Meanwhile, her sister WW, armed with intel from Division, is also on the hunt. However, Division’s orders lead WW in the opposite direction of the sighting. Trusting her instincts, WW heads to the city block where the sighting was reported. Tragically, she arrives too late—the building explodes, and Solaria is caught inside. Vulnerable after the explosion, Solaria is kidnapped and taken to a mysterious location known as “The Chamber,” accessible only through the dark web. Powerless to intervene, WW watches a live broadcast of Vain and Hemlock subjecting her sister to horrifying torture. Determined, WW vows to leave no stone unturned in her search for Solaria","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Chamber Part 1","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":3483986,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Halsey Rae","original_name":"Halsey Rae","popularity":0.622,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65e452689979d20130af2f69","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2304249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bella Rolland","original_name":"Bella Rolland","popularity":32.027,"profile_path":"/x3UjyPI05EZhNFCcMNcg5YK3ceX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65e45274fe077a018510cf08","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":3002305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Wright","original_name":"Allen Wright","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65e452a0b7a154014777e199","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
