Her legal guardian, a lecherous old man who has the hots for her, hires a private detective to spy on her. He tails her to a train headed for New Orleans, but she catches on to him. She befriends a young woman aboard the train and they both give the private eye the slip. What Diane doesn't know, however, is that that her newfound friend is actually a notorious criminal known as The Moth, and she has her own reasons for helping Diane escape--she, too, is being tailed by a detective, who's after a cache of jewels she's stolen.","popularity":0.2005,"poster_path":"/hn4OtpGHfHTMKZRvCT0vgPqiA8N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36236,"logo_path":null,"name":"Showmen's Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":36237,"logo_path":null,"name":"Screencraft Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1934-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Moth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":144019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sally O'Neil","original_name":"Sally O'Neil","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/fnuaiF3QDM2Jf28s7Ir6fkR2C0a.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Diana Wyman","credit_id":"52fe4d05c3a36847f824a2f3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1067737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Page","original_name":"Paul Page","popularity":0.0791,"profile_path":"/rfxPc4PpYozGJp8UQ8B4RldmGdn.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"George Duncan","credit_id":"52fe4d05c3a36847f824a2f7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilfred Lucas","original_name":"Wilfred Lucas","popularity":0.3261,"profile_path":"/rr70uPoMMtkHFYSPn0JTwI9ikQ9.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"John Gale","credit_id":"52fe4d05c3a36847f824a2fb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Kelsey","original_name":"Fred Kelsey","popularity":0.1849,"profile_path":"/cNLIBwSJZJzE2k4XfYdwPXdsds0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Detective Blake","credit_id":"52fe4d05c3a36847f824a2ff","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Duncan Renaldo","original_name":"Duncan Renaldo","popularity":0.2247,"profile_path":"/vusu8EXimaP9o79MH8QDHlnze9O.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Don Pedro","credit_id":"52fe4d05c3a36847f824a303","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1153570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rae Daggett","original_name":"Rae Daggett","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Marie LeMaire aka The Moth","credit_id":"52fe4d05c3a36847f824a307","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":939901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Guilbert","original_name":"Nina Guilbert","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Auntie Jane Stevens","credit_id":"61b64289a3d02700897659ab","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1198893,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgia O'Dell","original_name":"Georgia O'Dell","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Old Maid Train Passenger","credit_id":"61b64298a3d0270063a45659","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143385,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred C.
