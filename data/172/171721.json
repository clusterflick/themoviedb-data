Since 2006, nearly 1,000 camioneta drivers and fare-collectors have been murdered for either refusing or being unable to pay the extortion money demanded by local Guatemalan gangs. LA CAMIONETA follows one such bus on its transformative journey: a journey between North and South, between life and death, and through an unfolding collection of moments, people, and places that serve to quietly remind us of the interconnected worlds in which we live.","popularity":0.8196,"poster_path":"/g7ED1cvLALsIjeWWaCFlKmDXOzE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":236095,"logo_path":null,"name":"Follow Your Nose Films","origin_country":""},{"id":182211,"logo_path":"/6zVMl6pJen39xyK0qd5PWtlV4Xm.png","name":"Ek Balam Producciones","origin_country":"GT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"GT","name":"Guatemala"}],"release_date":"2013-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Camioneta: The Journey of One American School Bus","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1154262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Kendall","original_name":"Mark Kendall","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d12c3a36847f824d173","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1172523,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Esther Robinson","original_name":"Esther Robinson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d12c3a36847f824d179","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1154262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Kendall","original_name":"Mark Kendall","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d12c3a36847f824d17f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1154262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Kendall","original_name":"Mark Kendall","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d12c3a36847f824d185","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1077642,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tom Paul","original_name":"Tom Paul","popularity":0.0763,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d12c3a36847f824d191","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1154262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Kendall","original_name":"Mark Kendall","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d12c3a36847f824d19d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":103477,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Shannon Kennedy","original_name":"Shannon Kennedy","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d12c3a36847f824d1a3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":836378,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"T.
