With Bon Scott, this is AC/DC at one of their best times!  Filmed by the BBC on October 27th 1977 for \"Sight & Sound In Concert\" and broadcast on 29 October 1977.  Originally shot on video, the audio used on this DVD was taken from the original video master which was in mono, so the 2.0 mix is not a 'real' stereo mix. Although issued commercially and only in Japan, this DVD can be considered a semi-official DVD, not authorized by the band or Sony, and the US release planned for February 2003 was canceled for this reason. Counterfeit copies have been released.","popularity":0.8512,"poster_path":"/54XGtezkEJWOh3Xr4FyVDRQQYiq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127048,"logo_path":null,"name":"VAP Video","origin_country":""},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2003-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"AC/DC: Live '77 At The Hippodrome Golders Green London","video":true,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"ACDC Live '77","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bon Scott","original_name":"Bon Scott","popularity":0.1148,"profile_path":"/yfsXsxcUA1ISpeyZGfJln4BX4NF.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Vocals","credit_id":"583b6248c3a3687bac0022db","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angus Young","original_name":"Angus Young","popularity":0.1218,"profile_path":"/wQbsQEQkM9QUZPytmCIfo70D2G5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lead Guitar","credit_id":"583b6258c3a3687bac0022e5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malcolm Young","original_name":"Malcolm Young","popularity":0.0647,"profile_path":"/mWp3SVP3S0fos4UaF7sM8kNWmQJ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Rhythm Guitar","credit_id":"583b629c92514124900003db","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cliff Williams","original_name":"Cliff Williams","popularity":0.0733,"profile_path":"/7nXedWc1NpW7Uky0FTnrtWcFMqU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bass Guitar","credit_id":"583b6301c3a3687bac00232d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Rudd","original_name":"Phil Rudd","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/h5KTDmdg2iWKEqscJgVOOLaLFH3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Drums","credit_id":"583b6312c3a36860000003e1","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2447886,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Corcoran","original_name":"Tom Corcoran","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e08e2445ff34e0013b95359","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2493488,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Keith Harrow","original_name":"Keith Harrow","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e08e2729bcd0f001514ad40","department":"Sound","job":"Audio Post Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2087376,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Appleton","original_name":"Michael Appleton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e08e21dd236e60016a251e2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2HjgpuHbU5TBrJ0AbvaZ51z0KvB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":804,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/54XGtezkEJWOh3Xr4FyVDRQQYiq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":536}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":156205,"name":"concert film"},{"id":198299,"name":"live music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
