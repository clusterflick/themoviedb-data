Actors read texts written by Eustache, including the following reflection: “The role of the author in cinema should be one of non-intervention.” This sentence reminds us that he belongs to the greatest of film traditions (he cites Griffith, Renoir, Dreyer, and Lang as his models), the one that sees cinema as a matter of placing the camera in front of reality and capturing it ardently, precisely, and without tricks.","popularity":0.1707,"poster_path":"/oCsmfc76hs8ZqveXpwgyKhXbtz7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2426,"logo_path":"/ebQiHrVpqSs93D3A6eEDy9OFO52.png","name":"Les Films
