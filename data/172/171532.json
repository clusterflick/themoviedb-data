Two freewheeling, party-happy young men, Luis and his buddy Antonio, catch the train in to San Miguel, on a visit to Luis's grandmother, Doña Luisa, and his sister Esther. Unfortunately for the visitors, Luisa's goddaughter Rosita, is sitting near them in the same train car. She soon catches wind of the boys' wild tendencies, and makes a point of telling Luisa. Furious, the crotchety old woman decides to teach the bad boys a lesson by beating them senseless with her cane and forcing Luis to seek out a proper mate for Esther. Unfortunately, Esther has already fallen in love with Antonio - who could care less.","popularity":0.1644,"poster_path":"/9D8Sjrqvh2vD7nnw5JRhqgeEmT1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"1953-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El lunar de la familia","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1007584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis Aguilar","original_name":"Luis Aguilar","popularity":0.2694,"profile_path":"/rCjw9T5ZFRGo6lrPFPMrMCFGztN.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"544cff9cc3a36872b80023a2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":974650,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Badú","original_name":"Antonio Badú","popularity":0.1212,"profile_path":"/c4G5ZImYqss7LHYC8Z9Cl6bteUF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d0ec3a36847f824c293","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":533398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara García","original_name":"Sara García","popularity":0.3593,"profile_path":"/ea1aZzvYzFckP0yX1fkVOats56W.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5447797dc3a3686d92001d80","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":974651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esther Fernández","original_name":"Esther Fernández","popularity":0.1824,"profile_path":"/zMR2LRaPDgngXaA454QiO4B7PL8.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d0ec3a36847f824c29b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":94776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Cristal","original_name":"Linda Cristal","popularity":0.5718,"profile_path":"/3nlyw5APVkJAeSBtPwu4DUH3xRt.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d0ec3a36847f824c29f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1145001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Montes","original_name":"Sara Montes","popularity":0.1377,"profile_path":"/b190s0VR03kWpeeotqhWcmncXow.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d0ec3a36847f824c2a3","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1027099,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fernando Méndez","original_name":"Fernando Méndez","popularity":0.088,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d0ec3a36847f824c28b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0179953","wikidata_id":"Q5352463","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9D8Sjrqvh2vD7nnw5JRhqgeEmT1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1953-05-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
