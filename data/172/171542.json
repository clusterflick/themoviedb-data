Set hundreds of years in the future, a derelict spacecraft, controlled and powered by a human brain, floats aimlessly in the outer reaches of space. Trapped in the cold, mechanical prison of the vessel, the brain, which has no recollection or concept of self, miraculously begins to experience disjointed images of its former life - images it cannot understand. Yearning for freedom and yet unable to move, the brain devises a plan to build itself a mechanical body from parts of the ship. Maybe then it will understand the images it is seeing - maybe then it will feel alive.","popularity":0.6598,"poster_path":"/m9Xuwfg5DOF4FeGqQA1QvJwmF0h.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"HENRi","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Henri 2.0","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keir Dullea","original_name":"Keir Dullea","popularity":0.386,"profile_path":"/5QyrGWxujX8XA3Ny3M8D18TWupi.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Henri (voice)","credit_id":"52fe4d0ec3a36847f824c3e1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margot Kidder","original_name":"Margot Kidder","popularity":1.2484,"profile_path":"/bqFP3Tnd40ff9GzaBzqfNxWZkFq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dr. Calvin","credit_id":"52fe4d0ec3a36847f824c3e5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1856999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoe Reheem","original_name":"Zoe Reheem","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Henri's wife","credit_id":"5975e6ac92514157fb02e64c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1857000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tobin Shyrock","original_name":"Tobin Shyrock","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Henri's son","credit_id":"5975e6e5c3a3680cb700f6b3","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1154083,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eli Sasich","original_name":"Eli Sasich","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d0ec3a36847f824c3eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1154083,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eli Sasich","original_name":"Eli Sasich","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d0ec3a36847f824c3f1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1365997,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeffrey J.
