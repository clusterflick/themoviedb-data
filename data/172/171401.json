The confessions include his loneliness, his obsessions with women, his bewilderment by fame, his sense of the disintegration of Sixties' subculture, his nervous breakdown in 1973, and his peace now.","popularity":0.626,"poster_path":"/wUzSbxpgyWAsTvk3yStnjbXbaxJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
