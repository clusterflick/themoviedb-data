Now fans can take a look back at the life and career of one of cinema's most prolific composers through interviews with both the composer himself and many of his longtime collaborators. From his Italian efforts to his work in America, this documentary covers every aspect of Morricone's career as few have, offering insight into his childhood, his longtime association with Leone, and his ultimate disenchantment with the American studio system.","popularity":0.8702,"poster_path":"/g4B26f3swqb0x20EqoBsB3AmkeJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11237,"logo_path":"/nzPEges9ftjCDQWru0qrIfTX8OR.png","name":"ZDF/Arte","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Man and His Music","title":"Ennio Morricone","video":false,"vote_average":6.667,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1259,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ennio Morricone","original_name":"Ennio Morricone","popularity":0.412,"profile_path":"/avjgzi45bdXgC1AtyNsRc5nxtFM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e65941dd35dea0015013dff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19665,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Boorman","original_name":"John Boorman","popularity":0.383,"profile_path":"/jMSpwdhkIsIGskwVE38Bdtazfy1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e65947a151c5c0015008122","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":380,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert De Niro","original_name":"Robert De Niro","popularity":9.1089,"profile_path":"/cT8htcckIuyI1Lqwt1CvD02ynTh.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5e65949b55c92600155fd5c4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1150,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian De Palma","original_name":"Brian De Palma","popularity":1.0083,"profile_path":"/4xleWFdhtVC7faer6Ru2eyEgfTv.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e6594a6151c5c0015008166","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8967,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Puttnam","original_name":"David Puttnam","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/hA4XBy55LiLLhlgF5vYASumezvz.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e65a32dd35dea00130141bc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1095450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Frayling","original_name":"Christopher Frayling","popularity":0.1242,"profile_path":"/3c4RaWW6ZONpifZ0f1FhB9NanXd.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e65a3a0151c5c0015008f83","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65314,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giuseppe Tornatore","original_name":"Giuseppe Tornatore","popularity":0.5736,"profile_path":"/pjVrtNGsCSNs5IeRVr34PMn1hVR.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e65a459151c5c0013007dfb","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2560708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergio Micelli","original_name":"Sergio Micelli","popularity":0.2032,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e65a6f6459ad60011599da0","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1536655,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Goffredo Petrassi","original_name":"Goffredo Petrassi","popularity":0.1053,"profile_path":"/8r1cqGe6Q2TDXM8t8ei8yDgNu4f.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e65a7b1151c5c001500955f","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":466,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David M.
