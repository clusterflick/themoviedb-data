He works for a newspaper, and is a heavy drinker. She is a respected hairdresser, working for Birger, a commom friend. John, usually, bottle-in-hand is an ace at being at the wrong place at the wrong time. Tired of John's drinking, Siri decides to leave him and move to her parents' house. John's drinking then worsens, and their apartment becomes a mess. Siri decides to return to her and John's place, and that's when the Absolute Hangover really begins with a vengeance.","popularity":0.387,"poster_path":"/skJf2aEHsqkc2pYR2NhWwgKK3Cg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77673,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monolith Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"1999-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Absolutt Blåmandag","video":false,"vote_average":4.1,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ingar Helge Gimle","original_name":"Ingar Helge Gimle","popularity":0.2431,"profile_path":"/1wNiK1L4N8u4VN8YnejHo4Mj2uW.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jon","credit_id":"5745eb5892514127cb0009a6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":118052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brit Elisabeth Haagensli","original_name":"Brit Elisabeth Haagensli","popularity":0.118,"profile_path":"/hXwyD0pMvsxXDW1o7stepQId3kN.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Siri","credit_id":"5745eb60c3a3682a73000954","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Per Christian Ellefsen","original_name":"Per Christian Ellefsen","popularity":0.2263,"profile_path":"/d1wapUe0uCDsIdGWXpTlfNzS1z6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Birger","credit_id":"5745eb6ec3a3681ae3000b02","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107542,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gard B.
