The intention of the film is to be in contact with a a different kind of perception. We witness the main character's struggle with her disease first hand, raw. We follow her while she fights against a medical system, which penalizes the already penalized patients. We look at the love between her and her mother. In a way, the disease itself seems to play a secondary role. What we see is universal. It is a film about love.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/qywLZEwWtxEnGy8yAD49lU5A7g3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"I am just a visitor in your world.","title":"I Am a Visitor in Your World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3632647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Babcock","original_name":"Rebecca Babcock","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62d97cfa904f6d0067dd51c5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1196501,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miguel Silveira","original_name":"Miguel Silveira","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/2O6CjbIfjexVDLLDiehlekagxZU.jpg","credit_id":"62d97d0b35818f04d42b0f42","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3632649,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Scott Busch","original_name":"Scott Busch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d97d27d7059406b07d0f00","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3632650,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ehsan Ghoreishi","original_name":"Ehsan Ghoreishi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d97d5e764b9905e26a3e9c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3632651,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joel Styzens","original_name":"Joel Styzens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d97d9acb5c8e004f0e5d12","department":"Sound","job":"Music Arranger"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2447938","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":2496,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qywLZEwWtxEnGy8yAD49lU5A7g3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
