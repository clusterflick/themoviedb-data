His son, Chi-Shiung, has just come home from Taipei in order to take care of his father's Baozi (steamed buns with stuffing) business. Although he didn't want to take over his father's store, Wang insisted he wanted to keep it. Chi-Shiung suggested to his father that he hire some extra staff and so Ying, a Vietnam woman, is hired.
