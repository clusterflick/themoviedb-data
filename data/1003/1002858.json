Brave knights such as Sir Lancelot and Sir Galahad walk its stony corridors preparing for their next quest, while its loyal citizens go about their daily lives protected by its vast walls and sat in resplendent glory at the head of the Round Table is Arthur, King of Britain.\r But is there any factual basis for this most famous of fortresses or is it pure legend, a castle built on the idea of chivalry and nothing more?
