We follow the harrowing escape from Paradise as the town ignited from wind-driven embers and burned within a few hours of the fire's start. We visit fire labs where researchers torch entire houses to learn why some homes burn and others survive. We learn from Native Americans as they employ fire to benefit nature and increase community safety as they have for thousands of years. We follow researchers who work to understand the effects of climate on forests and the crucial role that natural forests play in storing vast amounts of carbon. Along the way we listen to people who have survived the deadliest fires to underscore the importance of this quest.","popularity":0.6789,"poster_path":"/ipFVgmMozFYRVSb8GDSTxZtyUwS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Redefining Our Relationship With Fire","title":"Elemental: Reimagine Wildfire","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"美国大火","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Oyelowo","original_name":"David Oyelowo","popularity":1.1636,"profile_path":"/7UZHRwOKe2cYxj8SeNUklyPYkns.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"673fd271ae12bafff5754ba3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3632080,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Trip Jennings","original_name":"Trip Jennings","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d8e353706e56004e69eebf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3632086,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sara Quinn","original_name":"Sara Quinn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d8e3e2d705940067b1680e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3632080,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Trip Jennings","original_name":"Trip Jennings","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673fcff1015d2e0f702df35c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3632080,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Trip Jennings","original_name":"Trip Jennings","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673fcffe015d2e0f702df363","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5073829,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ralph Bloemers","original_name":"Ralph Bloemers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673fd00f8b4e4c2ef6f775ca","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5073829,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ralph Bloemers","original_name":"Ralph Bloemers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673fd02c703e85589d186034","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3632086,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sara Quinn","original_name":"Sara Quinn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673fd03e8b4e4c2ef6f775dc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5073830,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nick Jaina","original_name":"Nick Jaina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673fd04832a9aaf43d966e07","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5073831,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Aaron Keuter","original_name":"Aaron Keuter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673fd057703e85589d186052","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5073832,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ryan Walsh","original_name":"Ryan Walsh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673fd06c4a3dc178173d25de","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":985706,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Cornelius","original_name":"Adam Cornelius","popularity":0.1541,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673fd0777b825e685b4e0a82","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1535526,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Annie Jeeves","original_name":"Annie Jeeves","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673fd0857b825e685b4e0a8b","department":"Production","job":"Publicist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21840496","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.784,"height":1121,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7j8WdgXxna1a5GVB8PTXpKk3EhZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ipFVgmMozFYRVSb8GDSTxZtyUwS.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/k3XHxqWxpYmcm48adSLhiMkmRez.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Elemental: Reimagine Wildfire, Theatrical Trailer Official","key":"U9cOLpUWPD8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-03-03T20:02:13.000Z","id":"673fd0b64a3dc178173d25f3"}]}}}
