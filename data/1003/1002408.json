VISTARA presented not only the great monuments of Indian history but also examples of the vernacular habitat that existed alongside - and the beliefs and mythic imagery that had generated them both. The video is a single-screen condensation of a 9-projector multi-media presentation created by Imtiaz Dharker to articulate the central themes of the exhibition.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/oPeoYA9F9adE7xdJwmVpO52ee4b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":179153,"logo_path":null,"name":"Govt. of India","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1980-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"VISTARA: The Architecture of India","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3632227,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Imtiaz Dharker","original_name":"Imtiaz Dharker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d90864764b990140d97d87","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1381368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Correa","original_name":"Charles Correa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/Afze6560arjaoeF5X501aq7hE9C.jpg","credit_id":"62d908511065d3028d3af2a5","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1385,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oPeoYA9F9adE7xdJwmVpO52ee4b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":969},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1105,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pZQHofwhZkaEZNLWBXg5nSsOgMV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":736}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
