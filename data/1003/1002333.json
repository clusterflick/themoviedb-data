Twice, Sandberg faced future Hall of Fame closer Bruce Sutter as the tying run in the Cubs’ last at-bat. Twice, he homered to the bleachers in left field to extend the game, which was later won on a walk-off single by Dave Owen. Subsequently, the game became known by a simple yet infamous moniker: \"The Sandberg Game.\"","popularity":0.6971,"poster_path":"/cWllLqT0pwAE1Pi1YBMEzjEIqPN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sandberg Game","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2660054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryne Sandberg","original_name":"Ryne Sandberg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6334adb99ee0ef007ebfd7dc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":160042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Costas","original_name":"Bob Costas","popularity":0.5564,"profile_path":"/icnJnhC0voFGH9QaIiWQf5MhL5N.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6334add7eec4f300801bc095","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1214263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ozzie Smith","original_name":"Ozzie Smith","popularity":0.0989,"profile_path":"/u2IRcSK27191s3tLQsYhLwGvORO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"669e67d85dfb9ea8df8f00f3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4843654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Sutter","original_name":"Bruce Sutter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"669e67e6b5a43cba802e52d1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4843655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Smith","original_name":"Lee Smith","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"669e67fc68c58f898980543f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2651437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Sutcliffe","original_name":"Rick Sutcliffe","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"669e683367930317dff37605","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4843658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jody Davis","original_name":"Jody Davis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"669e6840394d1c952b8ef670","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4843659,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Dernier","original_name":"Bob Dernier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"669e685675734c27d2a6ef26","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4843661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Hartig","original_name":"Ed Hartig","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"669e686a61d93289c7186d3b","order":8}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.658,"height":1095,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cWllLqT0pwAE1Pi1YBMEzjEIqPN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-06-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
