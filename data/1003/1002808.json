Playing in a Trio Formation has always been a musical moment of truth for most pop, jazz, blues and rock musicians --- but for Larry it is an opportunity to showcase his spectacular, full-fledged exhibition of sophisticated groove joy and grace!  His love for music and his pleasure of surfing on the crystal sounds spring out of his soul and shine throughout the show.  We are proud to present Larry's fans around the world with this awesome performance of impeccable musicianship --- back by rising star Travis Carlton (like Father like Son, the \"DNA factor\") on bass and master drummer Toss Panos.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Larry Carlton Trio - New Morning: The Paris Concert","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
