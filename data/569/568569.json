The first story, \"Sozinho\", is about a man meeting up with a young woman he met earlier in the day. When he gets to her place, she has a special surprise in store for him. \"Coleção de Humanos Mortos\" is the second story, and in it a young man is plagued by his inner demons, pushing him to satisfy his desire to inflict pain on others. Finally, in \"06 Tiros, 60ml\" a man wakes up to find himself trapped inside a hospital with blood-soaked faceless monsters and must do what he can to escape, even if that means killing every monster or person he comes across.","popularity":0.2338,"poster_path":"/yHY3XqIrwphLBgLciWHzOlxPR0P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85929,"logo_path":null,"name":"Black Vomit Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2006-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"3 Cortes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1262735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gurcius Gewdner","original_name":"Gurcius Gewdner","popularity":0.1221,"profile_path":"/aRe8AWNs3zupxKS2GgJskd6oRFc.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5c14a076c3a36866c036551b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fernando Pavão","original_name":"Fernando Pavão","popularity":0.1673,"profile_path":"/pqbav3YkO8RIOShlKpr6ukbAkFw.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5c14a08092514132c60a5e8f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1887060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mara Vanessa Prieto","original_name":"Mara Vanessa Prieto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5c14a08a92514132bd0a5f82","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":90214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thaís Simi","original_name":"Thaís Simi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5c14a0930e0a2603783c3284","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolas Trevijano","original_name":"Nicolas Trevijano","popularity":0.1204,"profile_path":"/9SXWUFvfO4LPwcW4mZFCqq7T5IA.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5c14a09d92514132c90a4e78","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":592582,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"André Z.
