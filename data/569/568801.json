He applies for work at a small logging mill, run with great craftsmanship but indifferent business skill by Favier (Guy Marchand), the son-in-law of the owner, Mathieu (Serge Reggiani). Francois has an ally in another man who works at the mill, Cyuri (Wotjek Pszoniak), who had formerly been his mother's lover. With his help, he easily settles into his job. He also quickly becomes the lover of his boss's wife Marie (Julie Jezequel). This leads to complications for all concerned, but as decent people, they find themselves at something of a standoff and are unable to resolve the situation easily.","popularity":0.0503,"poster_path":"/oQt5XhjulvnIXu2YcFa7et69dRH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coupe-franche","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2196339,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Pierre Sauné","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Sauné","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c1611370e0a2603853d32e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0097114","wikidata_id":"Q21427126","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.748,"height":1023,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oQt5XhjulvnIXu2YcFa7et69dRH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":765}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
