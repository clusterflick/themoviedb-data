Dixon considered a “vanishing race.” Dixon and his son Roland shot motion picture film as well as thousands of photographs (most of the photographs are archived at Indiana University). This film captures life on Crow Agency, Crow Fair and a recreation of the Battle of Little Big Horn featuring four of Custer’s Crow scouts.","popularity":0.0411,"poster_path":"/u3bJxk4d2HUOwwOLmSlOauA93lW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1908-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dixon-Wanamaker Expedition to Crow Agency","video":false,"vote_average":3.4,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2193953,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Joseph K Dixon","original_name":"Joseph K Dixon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c112d5c0e0a2638bc0feb65","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2193955,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rodman Wanamaker","original_name":"Rodman Wanamaker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c112d91925141479e0e76b3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2193953,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Joseph K Dixon","original_name":"Joseph K Dixon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d84f2a1f08eafea17b962a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5310737,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roland Dixon","original_name":"Roland Dixon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d84f4302e5aac44301081d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9426258","wikidata_id":"Q64761058","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u3bJxk4d2HUOwwOLmSlOauA93lW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1908-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
