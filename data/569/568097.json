Viewers learn how these artists responded to the initial challenge of not being able to become creatively involved with television. The show looks at how cultural institutions and organizations responded to this challenge and what happened when the doors were opened to artistsâ€™ desires to probe this unexplored territory.  From these early efforts and experiments, the program follows the rapid growth, diversification, and sophistication of video and media art from single channel works to complex pieces involving computer programs, museum video installations, and in the Internet. The Electronic Canvas aired in April 2001 on WGBH Channel 2 in Boston and then on public television stations nationally.","popularity":0.0509,"poster_path":"/18AjSzP4gywROGOCBH1DzpLXmkE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112263,"logo_path":null,"name":"DeCordova Museum and Sculpture Park","origin_country":""},{"id":112264,"logo_path":null,"name":"Creative Television Associates","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Electronic Canvas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2194231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Master-Harnik","original_name":"Paul Master-Harnik","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5c11a43a925141441a0035f1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2194232,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"George Fifield","original_name":"George Fifield","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c11a475c3a3682b41ee959d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred Barzyk","original_name":"Fred Barzyk","popularity":0.0958,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c11a45cc3a3682b4fee95e1","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2194236,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Geffen","original_name":"Mark Geffen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c11a52e0e0a2638af117ee8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2194240,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Deborah Cross","original_name":"Deborah Cross","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c11a5f30e0a2638bc10d6b6","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2194233,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Olivia Tappan","original_name":"Olivia Tappan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c11a4860e0a2638af117da3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2194241,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Judy Bourg","original_name":"Judy Bourg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c11a60ec3a3682b4fee9781","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2194236,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Geffen","original_name":"Mark Geffen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c11a5120e0a2638c511623e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2194237,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Richard Katz","original_name":"Richard Katz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c11a5489251414792100898","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2194242,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jack Celli","original_name":"Jack Celli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c11a626c3a3682b45ee9667","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2194238,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Eells","original_name":"David Eells","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c11a56c0e0a263143012fb2","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2194239,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Christine Holmes","original_name":"Christine Holmes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c11a5b0925141479210092d","department":"Art","job":"Props"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/18AjSzP4gywROGOCBH1DzpLXmkE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2001-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
