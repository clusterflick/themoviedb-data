Victor is shocked to discover his grandson's mixed heritage when he travels to London to pick him up, but resigns himself to the situation. Once at home in France, the brash Clem manages to steal the heart of the most coveted young woman in town, but that only gets him into trouble with her tough-guy boyfriend and his buddies. Meanwhile, Grandpa is trying to come to grips with his own biases as best he can.","popularity":0.2774,"poster_path":"/2LleQUhC93ohGXSbqRwAiBxq6QM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lien
