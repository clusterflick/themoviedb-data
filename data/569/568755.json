In the final months before 9/11, a liberal professor has reunited with his two sisters to celebrate their father's 75th birthday. Each having their own version of family history, the siblings clash over everything. Destructive secrets and long-held resentments surface as the three negotiate—with biting humor and razor-sharp insight—how much of the past they’re willing to sacrifice for a chance at a new beginning.","popularity":1.6851,"poster_path":"/2XA8qGysMkkGmKc0oiIjS3QZoYg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103196,"logo_path":"/eA1H91t6I1NHTsyDnmEDsk7BZbD.png","name":"BroadwayHD","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10492,"logo_path":"/3fcHNVpW66wgG6o0cgFJlcP8cCg.png","name":"Thirteen","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":132,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"If I Forget","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17351,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Bryggman","original_name":"Larry Bryggman","popularity":0.246,"profile_path":"/8G6HW1X6IT06Kwl9ldmGQuaW9nL.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lou Fischer","credit_id":"5d492f7a028f1400140168fe","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":205797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Dizzia","original_name":"Maria Dizzia","popularity":0.8636,"profile_path":"/sMsBH9o1kuFeVgjX2QoXvxccKJQ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sharon Fischer","credit_id":"5d492f8ca0be287cfda205d1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2045397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tasha Lawrence","original_name":"Tasha Lawrence","popularity":0.1866,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Ellen Manning","credit_id":"5d492fa3a0be280811a5c235","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":155222,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Shamos","original_name":"Jeremy Shamos","popularity":0.3336,"profile_path":"/4nEMfWgNBdBhzdzNGCOHyW941EC.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Michael Fischer","credit_id":"5d492fbaa0be280811a5c245","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2380128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seth Michael Steinberg","original_name":"Seth Michael Steinberg","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Joey Oren","credit_id":"5d492fd42d1e406fa1bec037","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":61114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Walsh","original_name":"Kate Walsh","popularity":1.7394,"profile_path":"/xKy0PNB5xLSwm6yyL3zZ5zUNvQZ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Holly Fischer","credit_id":"5d492fde2d1e405db5c27183","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gary Wilmes","original_name":"Gary Wilmes","popularity":0.2398,"profile_path":"/vQ6ZhHSJX7XRWFHCFCqnwxSiL0a.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Howard Kilberg","credit_id":"5d492ff12d1e406fa1bec089","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":993618,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bonnie Comley","original_name":"Bonnie Comley","popularity":0.1457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cfd84f3344c6018b7853bb","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1242326,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mitch Owgang","original_name":"Mitch Owgang","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cfd9421b722c017bc9140b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1507112,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Jess Goldstein","original_name":"Jess Goldstein","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cfd8869e45860185836d9c","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1555470,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Derek McLane","original_name":"Derek McLane","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cfd8733d7454017b92ab8c","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":217776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Horn","original_name":"David Horn","popularity":0.2116,"profile_path":"/imYeAGs6NJYPhP3QEmKRaON0NRY.jpg","credit_id":"65cfd92c2efe4e0147626eda","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1993821,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stewart F.
