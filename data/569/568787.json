Werneck was the first to introduce mosaics in Brazilian Modernist architecture. P.W. shows the context of the artist's work in Rio and Belo Horizonte in the 50s and 60s as well as Brasilia at the time of its construction in 1960. It's an inventive collage of archival footage, music and Werneck's modernist mosaics.","popularity":0.0996,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":102963,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jet Lag Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"P.W. – Paintbrushes and Panels","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1319903,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vivian Ostrovsky","original_name":"Vivian Ostrovsky","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/6zUuRK9t2MoFK1XRtyu7pHqzD7L.jpg","credit_id":"5c16025cc3a36866d8376f97","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2015369,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ruti Gadish","original_name":"Ruti Gadish","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c16026a92514132bd0b5d70","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claude Mercier","original_name":"Claude Mercier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c16027592514132ba0b4b96","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claude Mercier","original_name":"Claude Mercier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c16027cc3a36866ce375624","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1319903,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vivian Ostrovsky","original_name":"Vivian Ostrovsky","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/6zUuRK9t2MoFK1XRtyu7pHqzD7L.jpg","credit_id":"5c1602860e0a2603753d3076","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1319903,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vivian Ostrovsky","original_name":"Vivian Ostrovsky","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/6zUuRK9t2MoFK1XRtyu7pHqzD7L.jpg","credit_id":"5c16028f0e0a2603783d33a2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
