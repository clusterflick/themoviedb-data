On Sunday, December 8, 1996, father Steve Goodman and five of his children were in a car accident that resulted in the death of sons David (age 12) and Peter (age 11) and daughter LeAnne (age 10). They were buried together on December 14. Steve, and daughters Aimee and Andrea were on life support and had various complications, but eventually recovered.  The family immediately resumed their worldwide touring with a new mission, to speak of their personal experiences rebuilding their family after the devastation of the accident.
