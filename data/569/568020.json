Santa Quest is a feature documentary that follows John's journey to bring home the gold for Canada at the Santa Winter Games in Sweden. Armed with a diary cam and a film crew, John's trek takes him from training at the Calgary Santa School, to the basilica of St. Nicolas in Italy, to the Santa Village in Finland, to backstage with the Trailer Park Boys on tour. Along the way, he discovers that Santa and Christmas are really about time and family. For John, this journey is a springboard to explore broader concepts of religion, belief systems, existentialism, and his own achievements and failures.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Santa Quest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3843944","wikidata_id":"Q18168049","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
