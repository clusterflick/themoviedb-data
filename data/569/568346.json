Novice director Camille de Casabianca obtained permission from the authorities and set up her story around Valerie (Christine Citti), a woman who follows Yves (Yves Renier), the man she loves, to China. Yves is a journalist assigned to report on Western tourists behind the Bamboo Curtain, and it is an unintentionally comical group of tourists at that.","popularity":0.1713,"poster_path":"/jaQMhXpM9bQKJpC0lIZdiNPLT4p.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1986-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pékin Central","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yves Rénier","original_name":"Yves Rénier","popularity":0.1318,"profile_path":"/m6Xw9WczPGjuGfKF2AhDj47rYlZ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6751c0283494cc9bfbc602b0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":550338,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pascale Bailly","original_name":"Pascale Bailly","popularity":0.0584,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6751c03484ca928d00c9e610","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":238383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camille de Casabianca","original_name":"Camille de Casabianca","popularity":0.0518,"profile_path":"/zxgDb1s2c3ipYhI9xfexDmSJQCX.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6751c03b871a42c9c2451225","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38868,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alain Tasma","original_name":"Alain Tasma","popularity":0.1741,"profile_path":"/6dWIagbKLZgO9QYDpBpRbK0nrm1.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6751c04284ca928d00c9e61b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":238383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camille de Casabianca","original_name":"Camille de Casabianca","popularity":0.0518,"profile_path":"/zxgDb1s2c3ipYhI9xfexDmSJQCX.jpg","credit_id":"5c135fbf0e0a2603883b6643","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":238383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camille de Casabianca","original_name":"Camille de Casabianca","popularity":0.0518,"profile_path":"/zxgDb1s2c3ipYhI9xfexDmSJQCX.jpg","credit_id":"6751bff4ab6cc3a4c8fc6032","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56836,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raymond Depardon","original_name":"Raymond Depardon","popularity":0.1365,"profile_path":"/hYNHPXItm5ELS49dspIMDPoxRzh.jpg","credit_id":"6751c00884ca928d00c9e5e6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Verley","original_name":"Bernard Verley","popularity":0.1779,"profile_path":"/9I9T97CTBbCAQIqskDlhLuaiwIC.jpg","credit_id":"6751c01b3494cc9bfbc6029f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0091739","wikidata_id":"Q3411733","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":1772,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/jaQMhXpM9bQKJpC0lIZdiNPLT4p.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1189},{"aspect_ratio":0.741,"height":1023,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/gF9lgqagSBZSW73FZINGQ7ePXC2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":758}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hainan Island International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
