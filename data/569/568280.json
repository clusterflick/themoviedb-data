These are the \"Photograph-Women\". They are called this because they hold portraits of men in gilt frames in their arms: their sons, brothers, husbands - all of whom have disappeared trying to reach Lampedusa clandestinely at the time of the Arab Spring. Shortly before they arrived on the island, some of them made calls to their nearest and dearest.  Since then, no news. But nor have any bodies been found to demonstrate that they are dead. The calls received are interpreted as proof of life by the \"Photograph Women\".","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Photograph - Woman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2194700,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"nadia toujier","original_name":"nadia toujier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c12c61b92514132c30942ef","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2194701,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Matteo Vieille","original_name":"Matteo Vieille","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c12c63b92514132bd0942a0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2194698,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ester Sparatore","original_name":"Ester Sparatore","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c12c5bf92514132ba094326","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2194698,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ester Sparatore","original_name":"Ester Sparatore","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c12c5dcc3a36866c73535d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1542015,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Emmanuel Soland","original_name":"Emmanuel Soland","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dc36b517d5db500159c1e33","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
