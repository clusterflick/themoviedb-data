The images are taken from commercials and other commercially released films as well as my own shooting. Sections of frames were cut out and then placed into Super 8 film frames which had been painted upon, a mouth here, a leg there. This film can also be read like a comic strip on the rewinds. The film was blown up to 16mm. Ironically my hope had been to keep the film in Super 8 as a discourse on gauge chauvinism, one of the implications in the title.","popularity":0.3171,"poster_path":"/nRp9uMjKau2aTXQNRfmn0MCmBG6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1983-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Big Brother","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2035641,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caroline Avery","original_name":"Caroline Avery","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c15b345c3a36866c3373438","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nRp9uMjKau2aTXQNRfmn0MCmBG6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9A7NNxSto6o5VgaB9GptZQ051Id.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Mass.
