She single-handedly runs “Gajimaru Diner”, named after the large, deeply-rooted Gajimaru (banyan) tree in the area. Eventually, circumstances lead to her being brought together with an unknown traveler named Hayato, her ex-boyfriend Shota who returns after living in Tokyo for the past seven years, and a woman named Riko who shares something with both of them. As they work at the diner together, their relationships reveal themselves differently than what they had in mind.","popularity":0.7954,"poster_path":"/CejRrdGHD1UVwmX1VwsjkIzAOQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121339,"logo_path":"/119mbwFIqX2NEDLzqYNG8qVaLdC.png","name":"BS-TBS","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2014-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gajimaru Restaurant's Love","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Gajimaru Restaurant's Love","type":"literal title"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Gajimaru Shokudo no Koi","type":"Romaji"},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"榕树食堂之恋","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"がじまる食堂の恋：2014","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1406107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Haru","original_name":"波瑠","popularity":0.8206,"profile_path":"/rBPgsjsywuMMlWXGdxmvYBP2Zav.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mizuho","credit_id":"5d3e3233b87aec001339bc5f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yū Koyanagi","original_name":"小柳友","popularity":0.599,"profile_path":"/kN2QXRp9xw05fpLLjW9ODtiaIih.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Hayato","credit_id":"5fb7ee7533ad8f00405905bc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":592810,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Haruka","original_name":"竹富聖花","popularity":0.4533,"profile_path":"/5FomvcYxlP87loM9TPr7kDhaLfy.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Riko","credit_id":"5c12356d9251413536b99618","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2052465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natsumi Ikema","original_name":"池間夏海","popularity":0.1917,"profile_path":"/aLhThPjF5SyUBlycDXwrPBfo1nm.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Suchiru","credit_id":"5d3e2efb21621b483ff0a47c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":936282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dori Sakurada","original_name":"桜田通","popularity":1.5418,"profile_path":"/4w0HKeP52QaixEHWOMzYZTDGu1J.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Shota","credit_id":"5c123566c3a368242be73b02","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2159196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katsuhiro Higo","original_name":"肥後克広","popularity":0.2399,"profile_path":"/eNJaP8HN3B8wBnmBmSfubcOjjyx.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c12354a9251413536b9960f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1390052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dandy Sakano","original_name":"ダンディ坂野","popularity":0.1423,"profile_path":"/yolr07zHAC3Sm0757JduI5pY6pj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5c12355e0e0a26327d7b21f4","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114722,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kentaro Otani","original_name":"大谷健太郎","popularity":0.1576,"profile_path":"/yIHKrGnaRnC6jF2taOQS8UmfUE2.jpg","credit_id":"5c123540c3a3682424e73bbf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3675310,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Akira Egawa","original_name":"江川智","popularity":0.133,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b23fc4169e365af69fb82f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3630828","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/thqJwmFjksDsxV90bsWtxuKbXiY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4ZKggop0jtgvzYPXrGL4xhrWiVc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1413,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/CejRrdGHD1UVwmX1VwsjkIzAOQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gCBHjmwxqhN80NMHRkr68EJsMaF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5167,"name":"restaurant owner"},{"id":177973,"name":"chance meeting"},{"id":220470,"name":"broken romances"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"がじまる食堂の恋（予告編）","key":"bD4aLNF6N3I","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-04-23T15:00:08.000Z","id":"5d3e33e821621b0012f296af"}]}}}
