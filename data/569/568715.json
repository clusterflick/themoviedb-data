A haunted theater of collective and subjective memory is constructed from archival film and mass media representations. Signifiers of German history and cultural heritage — Wagnerian opera, Hitler's rallies, the Nuremberg trials, Bavarian folk dancers — are orchestrated and conjoined on the screen with male fashion iconography and autobiographical references. From ornate, 19th-century Baroque architecture to a contemporary menswear emporium, the artist traces an historical trajectory of cultural excess. Confronting his bourgeois German past, Odenbach achieves a personal history that questions the construction of identity within this cultural context.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"As If Memories Could Deceive Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1760785,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcel Odenbach","original_name":"Marcel Odenbach","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c158d6cc3a36866c53717fd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1760785,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcel Odenbach","original_name":"Marcel Odenbach","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c158d600e0a2603883ce2ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
