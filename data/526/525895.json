Unjustly imprisoned in Inverness at the age of 51, she expresses her anger in song, discovering a talent for music; these songs became central to the identity of the region and are still sung today. The achingly beautiful landscape of Skye, and the music it inspired, provide a haunting canvas for this valuable piece of historical research.","popularity":0.0418,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":19316,"logo_path":null,"name":"Freeway Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1994-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Gaelic","iso_639_1":"gd","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mairi Mhor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Mairi Mhor: Her Life and Songs","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Mairi Mhor: Na h-orain'sa Beatha","type":"Gaelic"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39812,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John McGrath","original_name":"John McGrath","popularity":0.0841,"profile_path":"/a5ErRlpJD67HcLyorIX06T7QTsX.jpg","credit_id":"60fdf205c439c00029f48e6b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1697313,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Alexander","original_name":"Mike Alexander","popularity":0.0907,"profile_path":"/mWCuU2jps1FibqhEdSDCYGQg9TD.jpg","credit_id":"5b054901c3a36864bd009462","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0107489","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"gd","note":"Cherbourg-Octeville Festival of Irish and British Film","release_date":"1994-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
