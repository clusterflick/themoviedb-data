Shu Haolun's family has lived there for three generations, enjoying a close-knit, communal way of life with their neighbors. Now Dazhongli and its surrounding neighborhoods are in the process of being demolished to make way for gleaming skyscrapers, towering apartment complexes and luxury shopping centers. In NOSTALGIA, Shu relays vivid details of growing up among narrow alleys and courtyards murmuring with neighborhood gossip, back when Shanghai was still closed to the world. While sharing a wealth of memories, Shu uses his camera to capture the everyday details of his home before they are wiped out forever.","popularity":0.0572,"poster_path":"/1S2vQzjAmS9OO0ggREP0Gm1mN0K.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2006-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nostalgia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"Xiang Chou","type":"romanization"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1279186,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Haolun Shu","original_name":"Haolun Shu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b03addf925141093101ef70","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13702414","wikidata_id":"Q125182801","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1S2vQzjAmS9OO0ggREP0Gm1mN0K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"Icarus Films / dGenerate Films","release_date":"2006-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
