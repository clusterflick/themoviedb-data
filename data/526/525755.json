The Nazis made him representative of the community destined for extermination. Victim of a tragic contradiction, after the Liberation he was tried and absolved from the accusation of collaborating with the Nazis; he moved to Rome, where he was ostracized by the Jewish community until he died. His son Wolf devoted his life to redeem his image, trying to paint a more complex picture of the role his father played in Terezín. The film reconstructs through the conversation between Wolf and the psychoanalyst David Meghnagi a son's relationship with the memory of his father, between the acceptance, the denial, and the thematization of a common and familiar tragedy.","popularity":0.0541,"poster_path":"/d82VKRirnWcfqX7jWcGG0cTm4OK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wolf","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2048258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolf Murmelstein","original_name":"Wolf Murmelstein","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b0438a09251410986031ac3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2048256,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Meghnagi","original_name":"David Meghnagi","popularity":0.0541,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b0438af925141095c02bc0d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1862706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Riccardo Di Segni","original_name":"Riccardo Di Segni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5b0439339251410948021a39","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2048260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Murmelstein","original_name":"Anna Murmelstein","popularity":0.0784,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5b04394592514109bc027ebd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2048262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toman Brod","original_name":"Toman Brod","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5b04394f9251412c2f00f910","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2048264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Markéta Pacovská","original_name":"Markéta Pacovská","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5b0439589251410948021a48","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128077,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claudio Giovannesi","original_name":"Claudio Giovannesi","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/arRuqpNGz70xWyFwG8Vp3awXtBr.jpg","credit_id":"5b0437f19251412c2f00f857","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2048256,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Meghnagi","original_name":"David Meghnagi","popularity":0.0541,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b04380c0e0a2623d702b528","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128077,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claudio Giovannesi","original_name":"Claudio Giovannesi","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/arRuqpNGz70xWyFwG8Vp3awXtBr.jpg","credit_id":"5b04381c0e0a26435400bd45","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":556737,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Giuseppe Trepiccione","original_name":"Giuseppe Trepiccione","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0438420e0a2623da029fa3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3332132","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1032,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y3waevQFuh1gLEEqCczV06jvNNZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1835},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1029,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i3QvwPVBcUGJUY0JRXrOMSooYY6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1829}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":956,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d82VKRirnWcfqX7jWcGG0cTm4OK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":677}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"German\", \"english_name\"=>\"German\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"de\", \"native_name\"=>\"German\"}","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
