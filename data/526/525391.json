Filmmaker and thirty-year veteran of the Albanian movie industry, Kujtim Cashku, attempted to hold a press conference to discuss a land dispute with his film academy and city officials. No one could believe what happened next in the former communist nation. Led by an half-drunk bureaucrat in long overcoat and fedora, police disrupted the peaceful gathering then tried to seize the school's garden and open air cinema. Gentian Koci's doc captures the dramatic days that followed when students, professors, activists and lovers of cinema battled to save the outdoor movie screen from destruction by police and corporate interests.","popularity":0.0981,"poster_path":"/uY33GWb8mme21laI5bc3YBvHgrY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95384,"logo_path":"/kKe7bzpomBrntXEMnhVx4MxNE2T.png","name":"Artalb Film","origin_country":"AL"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Albanian","iso_639_1":"sq","name":"shqip"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Not A Carwash","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1873318,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gentian Koçi","original_name":"Gentian Koçi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/pmWez9iXk4ELWOSl3drwKsVe7KT.jpg","credit_id":"5b01db5dc3a3686c7d00b033","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1873318,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gentian Koçi","original_name":"Gentian Koçi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/pmWez9iXk4ELWOSl3drwKsVe7KT.jpg","credit_id":"5b01db4d925141092300c733","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1873318,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gentian Koçi","original_name":"Gentian Koçi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/pmWez9iXk4ELWOSl3drwKsVe7KT.jpg","credit_id":"5b01db3d92514109c900f32c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82110,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Thomas Logoreci","original_name":"Thomas Logoreci","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b01db800e0a2623e600ddf1","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2046774,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mardit Lleshi","original_name":"Mardit Lleshi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b01dbb2c3a3686c8c013698","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1873318,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gentian Koçi","original_name":"Gentian Koçi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/pmWez9iXk4ELWOSl3drwKsVe7KT.jpg","credit_id":"5b01db22c3a3686c8600c308","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2569642","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uY33GWb8mme21laI5bc3YBvHgrY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":714}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sq","note":"Hot Docs 2012, Toronto","release_date":"2012-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"NOT A CARWASH by Gentian Koçi Trailer","key":"Mup47PpuNHA","published_at":"2012-10-14T17:21:48.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5b01d964925141097300dd90"}]}}}
