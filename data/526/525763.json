Through unique experiences from the original cast and crew, horror experts and various genre journalists, a broad and in-depth picture is painted about the one-of-a-kind horror legacy from the French side of Belgium, without forgetting the difficult cinema landscape of this small country with two very different languages. \"Surrealistic Nightmares: An In-depth Look at Walloon Horror Cinema\" is illustrated by exclusive behind the scene footage, famous film scenes and loads of original promotional
