Felix escapes through the backdoor and celebrates his special day like he wants: as a techno DJ in a dance club. One of his installed special effects is scaring the visitors that much, that they panic, leaving the club in a rush. The owner of the club gives Felix one more chance to pay back for the damage. Felix shall be the tour manager for Leon Rippy, a formerly well-known country musician. This might not be an easy task in times where country music seems to be kind of an antique thing. However Felix accepts the deal and an adventurous on-the-road experience throughout Germany begins.","popularity":0.4618,"poster_path":"/tbAsgEROrIqRJfHzsiXS3bfYvGJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1997-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Still
