Several years ago, a group of enthusiastic and committed people started to work for the protection of the Islands in the Sea of Cortez in Baja California Sur, Mexico. Thanks to this effort all the Islands became a UNESCO world heritage side, but the story of Espíritu Santo island is especially remarkable. It was bought back from different owners and donated to the people of Mexico for its conservation in perpetuity.  To celebrate the success of all the efforts and to remind people of our close relation to the ocean, renowned Spanish artist Cristina Iglesias was asked to make a piece of art for the Island. Cristina decided to create a \"Garden in the Sea\", a labyrinth-like setting of various screens sunk into the sea, that nature will grow over, generating marine life.","popularity":0.1671,"poster_path":"/f4nzJGYf5JHs9UNYEmzIG9iuJAE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104819,"logo_path":null,"name":"FEE Mexico","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2012-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Garden in the Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105764,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Thomas Riedelsheimer","original_name":"Thomas Riedelsheimer","popularity":0.0755,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0261899251410986016385","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105764,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Thomas Riedelsheimer","original_name":"Thomas Riedelsheimer","popularity":0.0755,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0261960e0a2623c701393f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105764,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Thomas Riedelsheimer","original_name":"Thomas Riedelsheimer","popularity":0.0755,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0261a50e0a2623cd0140f8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2047047,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Manuel Arango","original_name":"Manuel Arango","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b02629392514109bc011a5d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2047048,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rodolfo Ogarrio","original_name":"Rodolfo Ogarrio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0262c80e0a2623d4013cd1","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2047051,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alfredo Barroso","original_name":"Alfredo Barroso","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b02630892514109860164d9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1712208,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Johnny Friday","original_name":"Johnny Friday","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b02632c0e0a2623dd013c3e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2047055,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Shinya Kitamura","original_name":"Shinya Kitamura","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b02635a92514109c9014af0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1520859,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pedro Mejía","original_name":"Pedro Mejía","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b02638a9251410973012de2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2047056,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Thomas Schwarz","original_name":"Thomas Schwarz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b02640ac3a3686c95016c93","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2047057,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Felix Riedelsheimer","original_name":"Felix Riedelsheimer","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0264d70e0a2623ec01279c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2047058,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Friedericke Güsselfeld","original_name":"Friedericke Güsselfeld","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b02652b9251410969010fe2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2047059,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stephan Micus","original_name":"Stephan Micus","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b02654b92514109b400fca0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3920838","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":1438,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k55Sy2Vq8ZaSUR6imuMeYkI3wHK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":864,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f4nzJGYf5JHs9UNYEmzIG9iuJAE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":583}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":33577,"name":"environment"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hot Docs 2012, Toronto","release_date":"2012-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
