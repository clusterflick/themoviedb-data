The story gets along with the hippism ambience of 1970’s about peace. Flower Storm tells of the inhabitants of two towns who lives in peace and harmony until their kings start to fight over a bird they both have shot down while hunt-ing. War breaks out but children of the town during the night, substitute flowers for the cannon balls. The next day, there exists not a battle but flower storm.","popularity":0.1121,"poster_path":"/hGAnxyOL5oiMIhFrDFaR1lUWNfY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11459,"logo_path":"/q05YOjsHS2MBfteVQod3MRGkjCD.png","name":"Kanoon","origin_country":"IR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flower Storm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","title":"Golbaran","type":"original title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2046015,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Hossein Samakar","original_name":"Hossein Samakar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b005cdc925141406700123c","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1336258,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ali Akbar Sadeghi","original_name":"Ali Akbar Sadeghi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b005cf10e0a2608fd0011b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2046017,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Herayr Atashkar","original_name":"Herayr Atashkar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b005d3fc3a36851c500155e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2046016,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mohamad Feyjani–Kafafi","original_name":"Mohamad Feyjani–Kafafi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b005d2792514140d30012fb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1316246,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Esfandiar Monfaredzadeh","original_name":"Esfandiar Monfaredzadeh","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/cGzTqzzCCblZnNFIjNephGPKt5l.jpg","credit_id":"5fc78ef0b84f9400410fba48","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1091774","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":760,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hGAnxyOL5oiMIhFrDFaR1lUWNfY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Flower Storm ( گلباران ) by Ali Akbar Sadeghi","key":"q0D7h0k7Ajw","published_at":"2015-04-26T11:56:09.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"5b005d95c3a36851c2000cdc"}]}}}
