They are so effective that the Nazis offer a reward for the capture of the paper's staff, although they don't know their identities. One of them is a well-known entertainer, and when his jealous partner hears of the reward, he turns him in. The paper's publishers escape capture, but their staff doesn't. The paper's founders must find not only a way to keep from getting captured by the Nazis but keep their newspaper going and get their staff released.","popularity":0.9873,"poster_path":"/2bQMcGHBUCkgpe7YOoAs6puPpaZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1221,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gainsborough Pictures","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1942-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Uncensored","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Portman","original_name":"Eric Portman","popularity":0.2809,"profile_path":"/37W0YteueUf1Y6xUlJj0zmftcHB.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Andre Delage","credit_id":"5b055083925141468200804d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phyllis Calvert","original_name":"Phyllis Calvert","popularity":0.204,"profile_path":"/x8QEcS8X2gili9uD40lb8zTYv7R.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Julie Lanvin","credit_id":"5b0550980e0a261d9f007c94","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Griffith Jones","original_name":"Griffith Jones","popularity":0.127,"profile_path":"/5GT1CzdvxU0SY21QLcrHrb1UOaG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Father De Gruyte","credit_id":"648e5ab542bf010101be8b3b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86659,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Glenville","original_name":"Peter Glenville","popularity":0.0817,"profile_path":"/6Dm3cdPuq0JnY8NMJLlm1tHj69u.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Charles Neels","credit_id":"648e5b192f8d090100aa417a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":940864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederick Culley","original_name":"Frederick Culley","popularity":0.0862,"profile_path":"/728txf7KLePs6b8bQlpOg94NlQu.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Victor Lanvin","credit_id":"6490540a2f8d09013afb2515","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Lovell","original_name":"Raymond Lovell","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":"/9FjhATIvvaTJ1eEhR8uDlzrsS5M.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Von Koerner","credit_id":"648e5b8f26346200eb762d88","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":79641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irene Handl","original_name":"Irene Handl","popularity":0.2444,"profile_path":"/34MBakVUAGJo7boUYeLmCNUZfkm.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Frau Von Koerner","credit_id":"648e5b4d2f8d0900c665cfaa","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Jaffe","original_name":"Carl Jaffe","popularity":0.0519,"profile_path":"/nVhuF3FK6Ett5qrNTFnGkeVgA7S.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Kohlmeier","credit_id":"6490541d559d2200ff120b88","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1179776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stuart Lindsell","original_name":"Stuart Lindsell","popularity":0.1144,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Press Officer","credit_id":"6490542642bf0100c7fc9fa8","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Felix Aylmer","original_name":"Felix Aylmer","popularity":0.3387,"profile_path":"/aWeSVWt3e6d897mHKSQRiXwmF57.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Colonel Von Hohenstein","credit_id":"648e5b73c3c89100eb32bcaa","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":127020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eliot Makeham","original_name":"Eliot Makeham","popularity":0.2098,"profile_path":"/5px5MdbwSOP8mLueHksTTguEmW2.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Abb√© De Moor","credit_id":"6490543cc2ff3d00c59b3543","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.H.
