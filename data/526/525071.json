From the 1840s when P.T. Barnum exhibited Tom Thumb to the last remaining shows struggling to survive at New York's Coney Island, we learn the truth behind the sideshow adage that freaks are not born, but rather created, as performers share their memories of the magical midway.","popularity":0.4493,"poster_path":"/oq2GCB5xm3FRCUKzEbLVejRBY3l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3507,"logo_path":"/m7iLIC5UfC2Pp60bkjXMWLFrmp6.png","name":"History","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Circus Freaks and Sideshows","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":127966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Ackroyd","original_name":"David Ackroyd","popularity":0.4547,"profile_path":"/mT68BOMvr1Uk1t9i5TkWWdv6H82.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5affb8dc9251413673002e39","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":69892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Kent","original_name":"Arthur Kent","popularity":0.0692,"profile_path":"/22ZNUyYJhUSf6F02oOuHR2fJdEr.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Host","credit_id":"5affb8ed925141366100334f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2045723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grady Stiles Jr.","original_name":"Grady Stiles Jr.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5affb9010e0a26302f002cbb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2045724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Wadlow","original_name":"Robert Wadlow","popularity":0.0904,"profile_path":"/cMStl9OvrA5j1H61hWVCZwQzlDO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5affb90e0e0a2630390029eb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2045725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Zigun","original_name":"Dick Zigun","popularity":0.044,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5affb91b0e0a26302c002928","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2045726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Bogdan","original_name":"Robert Bogdan","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5affb941925141366a002df8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2045727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathy Maher","original_name":"Kathy Maher","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5affb94e0e0a263044002c4a","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1239902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sueann Fincke","original_name":"Sueann Fincke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5affb9c10e0a263035002ac1","department":"Production","job":"Supervising Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1008591,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arthur Drooker","original_name":"Arthur Drooker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5affb98c925141366a002e17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188042,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrew Keresztes","original_name":"Andrew Keresztes","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5affb9f70e0a26301b002e0a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1008591,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arthur Drooker","original_name":"Arthur Drooker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5affb97fc3a3687c560023c1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362904,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"George Copanas","original_name":"George Copanas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5affb9de0e0a26301e00316d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0370742","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oq2GCB5xm3FRCUKzEbLVejRBY3l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":191223,"name":"freaks"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
