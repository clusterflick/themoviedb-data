The life story of Dragica Srzentić casts light on a number of events and people relevant to Yugoslav history before and after the Second World War. The film’s look at the century-long life of this woman-hero provides insight into the rarely mentioned segments of the ex-Yugoslav intellectual and ideological maze that traverses all the states in which this Istrian-born woman lived (Austria-Hungary, Kingdom of Italy, Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, NDH, FNRJ, SFRJ, Croatia, and Serbia).","popularity":0.0806,"poster_path":"/rhbeFadza9PMao0zlt2MIG3Iasm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93353,"logo_path":"/kiIMn6uVvwLe2GBzJ70NTDinP74.png","name":"Playground produkcija","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2011-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":158,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Woman – One Century","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2134625,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dragica Srzentić-Vitolović","original_name":"Dragica Srzentić-Vitolović","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5ba9564d0e0a2635ec05e43f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2134624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ljiljana Đakonović","original_name":"Ljiljana Đakonović","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5ba9563fc3a3680e58058847","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1051272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Želimir Žilnik","original_name":"Želimir Žilnik","popularity":0.0776,"profile_path":"/iRED1Q2iwyXkmh2odTAbOotZGQc.jpg","credit_id":"5b030822925141094801595b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1594673,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miodrag 'Miša' Milošević","original_name":"Miodrag Milošević","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0308389251410948015969","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1051272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Želimir Žilnik","original_name":"Želimir Žilnik","popularity":0.0776,"profile_path":"/iRED1Q2iwyXkmh2odTAbOotZGQc.jpg","credit_id":"5b03082892514109bc019136","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2087826","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.654,"height":766,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rhbeFadza9PMao0zlt2MIG3Iasm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
