Their parents built communism, their grandfathers overcame fascism, but for them there is nothing to built and to struggle for. Two young residents of Moscow, recently graduated, spend time on the internet and do not clearly understand what they are living for, don’t understand their country and don’t see a perspective in the future. Television has plagued them with Big Winter Olympic Games in Sochi and they hire a car, buy tickets and drive throughout the country to see competitions, Black sea and Russian countryside.","popularity":0.1261,"poster_path":"/w5QXR9RjOxEOkR76aQsUqd1grlj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104378,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Point of View Studio","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2014-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Long.
