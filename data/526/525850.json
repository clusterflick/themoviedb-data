The CCC was basically put in place to give young men a job, boost their moral and protect the forests of California. Throughout the short we see the various jobs that were being performed and one really does get a great idea of what this mission was all about and why it was so important to Roosevelt.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/jNvma49hTru10nyXuNmgPTX9wwc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1935-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Can Take It","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2188955","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.723,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jNvma49hTru10nyXuNmgPTX9wwc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":542}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1935-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
