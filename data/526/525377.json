The continual barrage of repetitive propaganda makes her already banal existence that much worse. Although the film is competent and Eva well-interpreted, the telling of this tale needs a bit more inventiveness to sustain interest in a life that is supposed to be boring.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/9p6NsD8fLp6Yz1mbL5BjwXDIGwN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eva sur paysage ordinaire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2046748,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emmanuel Ciepka","original_name":"Emmanuel Ciepka","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b01c571925141093b00c064","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1590025","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.685,"height":817,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9p6NsD8fLp6Yz1mbL5BjwXDIGwN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":560}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-05-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
