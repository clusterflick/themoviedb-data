Well, you are not alone. Millions of people throughout the centuries have sought answers to this apocalyptic book of the Bible. The vision Christ gave to the Apostle John begins with a message to the 7 Churches of Asia Minor, (Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Ladocia). Some believe the book of Revelation was only for the time of early Christians. But others believe Christ’s message to the 7 Churches is timeless.  Dr. Mark Wilson – the founder of the Seven Churches Network and the Asia Minor Research Center in Antalya, Turkey – provides 209 insightful answers to important questions concerning the 7 Churches of Revelation and how these letters might impact your life and faith.","popularity":0.0621,"poster_path":"/kqFsk1qtpFCrIbW9Lxd3XCxNZIj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65737,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thinking Man Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":226,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Exploring The 7 Churches of Revelation","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Chapter 1, Getting to Know Mark Wilson","type":"Series"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Chapter 2, Patmos: The Revelation","type":"Series"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Chapter 3, Ephesus: The Revolutionary Gospel","type":"Series"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Chapter 4, Smyrna: Faithful Unto Death","type":"Series"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Chapter 5, Pergamon: Satan’s Throne","type":"Series"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Chapter 6, Thyatira: Jezebel","type":"Series"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Chapter 7, Sardis: Time to Wake Up","type":"Series"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Chapter 8, Philadelphia: The Victorious Church","type":"Series"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Chapter 9, Laodicea: The Lukewarm Church","type":"Series"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Chapter 10, Revelation: I am Coming Soon","type":"Series"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2989426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dr. Mark Wilson","original_name":"Dr. Mark Wilson","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/v0ZZbqvRZH6OF9JIi2MDBkTHJaD.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6721746f1d0b571b8a5c0850","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3073558,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Etienne Magnin","original_name":"Etienne Magnin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/sfHTb6BFZWsD1FuXCwe2mJCttoi.jpg","credit_id":"6722a4191df70f7920fedd50","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/u5pKIDSeFakRnRtnS4lQCIMNvQg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kqFsk1qtpFCrIbW9Lxd3XCxNZIj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":341192,"name":"the 7 churches of revelation series"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
