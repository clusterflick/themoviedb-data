The film explains - from the Slovak perspective, of course - how the exchange took place, how picturesque it looked, what its “numbers” were, and what its cultural effects were supposed to be. Although it was never an explicit trauma (similar to the German expulsion), Slovak-Hungarian relations, thanks to the ineptitude of later politicians, have still not completely stabilized to this day.","popularity":0.1603,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"}],"release_date":"1946-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"May We Live in Peace","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1136488,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Viktor Kubal","original_name":"Viktor Kubal","popularity":0.0665,"profile_path":"/vuYHebKG2WXLN8MYNlKVxWC8AMU.jpg","credit_id":"6721cc661d0b571b8a5c178e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1946-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
