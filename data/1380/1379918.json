Created by two sci-fi/horror super fans (who at the time truly were coworkers doing overnight mall security), Wayne Spitzer and Andy Kumpon are Status and AK, enforcement officers for the mysterious Viktor Corporation. In their mission to monitor and protect their strange little town, they encounter interdimensional beings, lichters, basilisks, gelatinous spirit guides, flux cores, bad teenagers, badass women and mullet-bearing beefcakes. And they can shoot (and smoke) their way out of almost anything!","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/ozaR03n2l8IvZNdj8ZCDZ4aJ5O3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dead of Night","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2232206,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wayne Spitzer","original_name":"Wayne Spitzer","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6721db990cd8a2a503accee3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ozaR03n2l8IvZNdj8ZCDZ4aJ5O3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
