They steal glances until Alice asks him one question that leaves everyone gasping. What follows is so shocking that any polite person shouldn't be engaging, but sod it, they all do. In this comedy against ageism, we are invited for an unusual ride. Like wine that gets better with age, our characters help reminding us that there is nothing sexier than the 'mind'. Even youth pales compared to these two strangers.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One track mind","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8649384","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
