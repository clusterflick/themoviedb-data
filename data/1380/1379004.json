Conversations accompanied by a paint roller and paint thinner open up old wrongs while revealing the complexity of interpersonal relationships. The absence of communication, or the lack of will to communicate, as a symptom of contemporary family ties, stands in contrast to caring for a family of pigeons that has made its nest on the director's balcony. The film, in its civility and authenticity, follows the lessons of a book dedicated to amateur filmmakers and thus enters into a subversive dialogue with the paradigms of film pedagogy.","popularity":0.1812,"poster_path":"/Q4OLQP06PuA8k9nMtPyVbwoY80.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32930,"logo_path":"/pk1mLuYxSmTWX0BdgzbHdUvRI5u.png","name":"FAMU","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2024-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Camera Tortura","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3770045,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Petr Michal","original_name":"Petr Michal","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67200a12e833d92ef060b432","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2487960,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jakub Podmanický","original_name":"Jakub Podmanický","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67249709cb548b716a82474b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3770045,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Petr Michal","original_name":"Petr Michal","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67249716cb548b716a824756","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2625991,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Matěj Lindner","original_name":"Matěj Lindner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67249725f08ab5d3f20387dd","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2530082,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adam Ligas","original_name":"Adam Ligas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67249765e7b37c73c69d1f35","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3770045,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Petr Michal","original_name":"Petr Michal","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67249799c1c7433ebbc426de","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":"Q130739705","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"cs","file_path":"/Q4OLQP06PuA8k9nMtPyVbwoY80.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":280617,"name":"student film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ji.hlava International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
