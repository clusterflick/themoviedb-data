By single-handedly running her shop, she builds connections with the regulars, forming a supportive community around her. This documentary explores the issue of elderly loneliness and the way they find solace and support in their community, often comprised of people who were once strangers. Additionally, we seek to honour Auntie Pearly for embodying the kampung spirit while offering essential services to her neighbourhood.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heartland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5030773,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kit Kai Wen Calista","original_name":"Kit Kai Wen Calista","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6721b0cb1df70f7920fec0a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Singapore Youth Film Festival","release_date":"2024-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
