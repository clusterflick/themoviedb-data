Early scientists and academics dismissed the artifacts as frauds and yet more were discovered for 30 years in burial mounds throughout the state of Michigan. The artifacts passed into storage and were mostly forgotten until the last decade of the 20th century when new research brought the controversy back to life.","popularity":0.2527,"poster_path":"/bgtF6YlKyhBM4S6fwOhdqbVnnBN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127607,"logo_path":null,"name":"MagellanTV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hoax or History: The Michigan Relics","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5031080,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thom Bell","original_name":"Thom Bell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672203d747fe097c193f9619","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y8OdvNHfGIkzqTLGucojZkSx5TJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/icxMlXoOD6AVee84Irs7gQ3kpqM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":6.667,"height":72,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zkQZUQCfF6TwPdZczrVaFwShKIW.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":480},{"aspect_ratio":6.488,"height":86,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/blBpZtfAyGnAh0pAYpT22J2xTmT.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":558}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bgtF6YlKyhBM4S6fwOhdqbVnnBN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4373,"name":"fraud"},{"id":179568,"name":"archaeological dig"},{"id":341111,"name":"archeological fraud"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
