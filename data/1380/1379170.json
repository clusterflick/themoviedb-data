Hundreds of fish with only glass separating them from people. The film is a probe into the lives of a married couple of aquarists who have dedicated their lives to fish and to each other. Aquaristics as a job that never ends. In my film, I observe how an aquarium exchange works, where fish are bought and sold, and I think about how deep a relationship can be with both fish and another person.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/zgwDx24yPXJPrILpmmryHOsF5aT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2024-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Couple of Fish","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5028756,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Veronika Tůmová","original_name":"Veronika Tůmová","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672056be6d6b705dc8720dbb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zgwDx24yPXJPrILpmmryHOsF5aT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":767}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
