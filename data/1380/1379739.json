In the back of my eyes, longings and obsessions, Outside someone is yelling Robert! I love New York….\" Robert Frank looks back on a lifetime of memory-gathering through photographs, home movies (his parents' gravesite, June Leaf making art), portraits of artist friends (Raoul Hague, Allen Ginsberg), and portraits of those he admired (Jean-Luc Godard). The film resembles one of Gregory Corso's \"shuffle poems,\" as Frank muses, \"Together go words and images without sound. I have an obsession in my life for Fragments which reveal and hide truth.\" — Museum of Modern Art","popularity":0.1267,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The eye must learn to listen before it looks.","title":"Moving Pictures","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2050126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raoul Hague","original_name":"Raoul Hague","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"675ef07dde8f34e0b2588db8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allen Ginsberg","original_name":"Allen Ginsberg","popularity":0.1576,"profile_path":"/w7qQvokS1lp7IRgefiJdALaaiIi.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"675ef083551f69f77cadee4c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238714,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Frank","original_name":"Robert Frank","popularity":0.0735,"profile_path":"/4UhHEdJhdh3wBhe87ZmPGPahKnY.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"675ef08b551f69f77cadee5b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1813317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"June Leaf","original_name":"June Leaf","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"675ef09075bd2f3e192784a8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Luc Godard","original_name":"Jean-Luc Godard","popularity":1.0955,"profile_path":"/zP5EDY5MstfkdBmPXNCj8Y6v5KR.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"675ef09dde8f34e0b2588dc6","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238714,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Frank","original_name":"Robert Frank","popularity":0.0735,"profile_path":"/4UhHEdJhdh3wBhe87ZmPGPahKnY.jpg","credit_id":"67219f5547fe097c193f8ae1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"World premiere of new digital remaster by The Museum of Modern Art.
