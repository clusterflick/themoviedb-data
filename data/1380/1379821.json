Robert and June were profoundly shaped by the landscape of Mabou, with its bitterly windswept winters, its rhythms of sea and light, and its pioneering routine of wood gathering, clothes hanging, window gazing, and art making. After Robert’s death, June continued working tirelessly on new sculptures and paintings. Not long before her own death, on July 1, 2024, June was able to watch a cut of the film and share her satisfaction with Whalen and Parlante, confiding, “You must be very happy to have made this film. I am happy to have this.” — Museum of Modern Art","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Another Light on the Road: Robert Frank and June Leaf's Canadian Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4658973,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Katherine Whalen","original_name":"Katherine Whalen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6721c1b41601419f7361cba4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5030905,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Parlante","original_name":"John Parlante","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6721c1be1601419f7361cbaf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
