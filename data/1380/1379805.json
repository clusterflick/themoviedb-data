Robert Frank plays Steiglitz, Frank is played by the artist Jerome Souther, and Frank’s artist wife June Leaf plays Steiglitz’s own artist wife Georgia O’Keeffe (the two women bear an uncanny resemblance). Together, the three share in simple domestic pleasures, the “hospitality, the wood stove in the kitchen, chicken for lunch, Steiglitz waiting for the sun to appear through the clouds.” — Museum of Modern Art","popularity":0.2398,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Remember","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238714,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Frank","original_name":"Robert Frank","popularity":0.0735,"profile_path":"/4UhHEdJhdh3wBhe87ZmPGPahKnY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Alfred Steiglitz","credit_id":"674e9afdaa844dc6ee9456df","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5096363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerome Souther","original_name":"Jerome Souther","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Robert Frank","credit_id":"674e9b18aa844dc6ee9456ff","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1813317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"June Leaf","original_name":"June Leaf","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Georgia O’Keeffe","credit_id":"674e9b2baa844dc6ee94570f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238714,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Frank","original_name":"Robert Frank","popularity":0.0735,"profile_path":"/4UhHEdJhdh3wBhe87ZmPGPahKnY.jpg","credit_id":"6721bfea1d0b571b8a5c155a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":910578,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Laura Israel","original_name":"Laura Israel","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674e9b41aa844dc6ee94571e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
