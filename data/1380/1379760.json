Through a series of tender, honest and visually stunning cinematic letters to the mother she lost at the age of ten and barely remembers, she grapples with the long-ignored effect of this death, the suppressed memories of her father’s life during the Holocaust, and a career as a filmmaker spent avoiding her own grief by giving voice to people who’ve survived extreme poverty and genocide.  With a collage of home movies, outtakes from her previous films and original animated artwork embedded in grandiose footage of vast landscapes that take us to India, France, Rwanda, Antarctica and New York, Anne Aghion asks a question we all face: How do we live past the heartbreaks, sorrows and traumas we endure and come out whole?","popularity":0.0289,"poster_path":"/sDYL8dOPDOx97OI6KIRvJ83nug9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Turbulence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1307961,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne Aghion","original_name":"Anne Aghion","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67c5a9f2db0508248a7a7de1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1307961,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne Aghion","original_name":"Anne Aghion","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6721a736991edb035c5f5aad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1307961,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne Aghion","original_name":"Anne Aghion","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6721a744003c4b5b5b640fc3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1307961,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne Aghion","original_name":"Anne Aghion","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6721a756991edb035c5f5ac2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2564274,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cynthia Kane","original_name":"Cynthia Kane","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/y5WXMp0waCzlz1tXuoxPeRqWbyA.jpg","credit_id":"6721a769991edb035c5f5acb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1549642,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Saumyananda Sahi","original_name":"Saumyananda Sahi","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":"/jgo0RK5riRLjahySS9y879bY5mN.jpg","credit_id":"6721a77bd9a8a77b5da4376a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1151529,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nadia ben Rachid","original_name":"Nadia ben Rachid","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/sZRSt3UpxhlbDex2jmHtfPIdHSO.jpg","credit_id":"6721a78a991edb035c5f5ad2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5025955,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Adrien Roche","original_name":"Adrien Roche","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/fM8cmLyfbirINtuOysMgv3LfxVl.jpg","credit_id":"6721a7a31d0b571b8a5c0ee2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1605584,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mélissa Petitjean","original_name":"Mélissa Petitjean","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6721a7b4d9a8a77b5da43779","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31556462","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/glPveSDpt2xoBVx8r24Ppgdx0xT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":779,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sDYL8dOPDOx97OI6KIRvJ83nug9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":546}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Dharanshala International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
