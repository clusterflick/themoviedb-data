Alas, the ideal husband happens to be a crook. On the night of the wedding, the fake nobleman robs his wife and abandons her. While the outraged Madame Millois looks for the real Count de Tremblay, Arlette seeks consolation with Maxime, a childhood friend. At last, the real count is found. Unsurprisingly, he is furious to learn that, legally, he is Arlette's husband. After a while though, he mellows and accepts to \"remain\" Arlette's husband.","popularity":0.2907,"poster_path":"/ASLHKlqx1naAehLzJ5bgQFdDDk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22396,"logo_path":null,"name":"Société Nouvelle des Établissements Gaumont
