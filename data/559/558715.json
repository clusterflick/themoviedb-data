This is doubtless because it offers a total symbiosis of music, text and movement – described by the critic of the Daily Telegraph of London as being ‘as close to the perfect dance opera as I have ever seen’. Or to quote Gilles Macassar in Télérama: ‘In the pit and onstage, the Brussels production has only one watchword: mobility, nimbleness, dexterity. The singers run, fly, whirl like dancers defying gravity. From the flies down to the footlights, the whole theatre is under a fantastic spell.’ For Christophe Vetter, on ConcertoNet: ‘This Orfeo can be seen again and again with immense pleasure. . . . René Jacobs’s conducting continues to arouse admiration for its precision, its stylistic rigour, its inexhaustible inventiveness and its feeling for the contrasts so vital to this repertoire.’","popularity":0.4221,"poster_path":"/oe8knMJe3RklWhhq7gl8qBLGcTf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":792,"logo_path":"/cRhBQP1FFNugNxKkO1pUgeD2Rkr.png","name":"RTBF","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'Orfeo, Favola in musica","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":496070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Keenlyside","original_name":"Simon Keenlyside","popularity":0.2641,"profile_path":"/vHgkO88a6x0iqDOpLesACBvuUiw.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Orfeo","credit_id":"5bdd75c892514137dd0093f2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2167448,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juanita Lascarro","original_name":"Juanita Lascarro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Eirodoce / La Musica / Eco","credit_id":"5bdd75e5c3a3682b2f00a06a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2167449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graciela Oddone","original_name":"Graciela Oddone","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Messagiera","credit_id":"5bdd75f30e0a26057e00a9c2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1595215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martina Dike","original_name":"Martina Dike","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Proserpina / Ninfe","credit_id":"5bdd76060e0a26058100a4ac","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2167453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Wallace","original_name":"Stephen Wallace","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"La Speranza / Pastori / Spiriti","credit_id":"5bdd761c0e0a26058f00a012","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1654381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tómas Tómasson","original_name":"Tómas Tómasson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Plutone","credit_id":"5bdd763092514137cf00a139","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2167454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Gérimon","original_name":"Paul Gérimon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Caronte / Pastori / Spiriti","credit_id":"5bdd76440e0a26058f00a048","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2167455,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mauro Utzeri","original_name":"Mauro Utzeri","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Apollo","credit_id":"5bdd764f92514137c900949b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2167456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Cambier","original_name":"Anne Cambier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Ninfe","credit_id":"5bdd7659c3a3682b3200aeae","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1542431,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Barret","original_name":"Pierre Barret","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bdd775492514137d4009b2e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1114246,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"René Jacobs","original_name":"René Jacobs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/fLjuYWjADwgR8qCPCu68rAfjCyq.jpg","credit_id":"5bdd778c0e0a26058f00a176","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1563798,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alessandro Striggio","original_name":"Alessandro Striggio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bdd773dc3a3682b2700a297","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95914,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Claudio Monteverdi","original_name":"Claudio Monteverdi","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":"/jOCDfg8XQABcdgQUXe62yrnKT2y.jpg","credit_id":"5bdd772b0e0a26059500a75e","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0461302","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nS3e4Z4Hlu8hX0IjTW1pDjyATL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oe8knMJe3RklWhhq7gl8qBLGcTf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"},{"id":3754,"name":"legend"},{"id":2033,"name":"hades"},{"id":11634,"name":"live performance"},{"id":208688,"name":"italian renaissance"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"1998-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
