An eminently political opera in which power struggles are interwoven with family conflicts, Simon Boccanegra echoes the life of its composer – the man who championed the cause of Italian unification and overcame the loss of his wife and children. Calixto Bieito, that most Shakespearean of opera directors, brings humanism and truth to a work haunted by gleaming images of the sea.","popularity":0.4021,"poster_path":"/qAbunGMZpCt4L3VyAMQgcuuVvFJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15355,"logo_path":"/bGLlMG6AcL7HcpeOUuFX5XbYJQN.png","name":"Opéra National de Paris","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":110411,"logo_path":null,"name":"Francois Roussillon Et Associés","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Verdi: Simon Boccanegra","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1267405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ludovic Tézier","original_name":"Ludovic Tézier","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/u9OD8isxAGK1oLJBs2HSHFCYo07.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Simon Boccanegra","credit_id":"5bda5257c3a36807990035d3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1984411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mika Kares","original_name":"Mika Kares","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/jb32iaZfx7dwBGZQmnwJvJ3I1Rl.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Jacopo Fiesco","credit_id":"5bda5264c3a368078b003620","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1663540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Agresta","original_name":"Maria Agresta","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/v4ho9ZVG5z1pEr6aRpHR9VW76Vx.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Maria Boccanegra (Amelia Grimaldi)","credit_id":"5bda5274c3a3680772003d66","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco Demuro","original_name":"Francesco Demuro","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/s3Hx5MaGA02CHE7oN7ikPfJOZF0.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Gabriele Adorno","credit_id":"5bda5284c3a3680799003610","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1923784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicola Alaimo","original_name":"Nicola Alaimo","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/nP8uSkuThIcBZdJ6E8ZwstnyBix.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Paolo Albani","credit_id":"5bda52950e0a2603b1003843","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1284199,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Fabio Luisi","original_name":"Fabio Luisi","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/oleLkdfMGLmuQ4VBcyVtdubIKVi.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5beb0a40c3a36817460559c5","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15130,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giuseppe Verdi","original_name":"Giuseppe Verdi","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":"/3W2HAqexkcpK6mWG3vseRlhD1ep.jpg","credit_id":"5bda51f4c3a368078b00357c","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140807,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Francesco Maria Piave","original_name":"Francesco Maria Piave","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bda52050e0a2603b6003a7a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093378,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arrigo Boito","original_name":"Arrigo Boito","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bda521092514154020034a5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1385410,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Antonio García Gutiérrez","original_name":"Antonio García Gutiérrez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bda5224925141540b00375c","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158931,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Calixto Bieito","original_name":"Calixto Bieito","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":"/ejZN87NaXPz1pGQNf9eGYE2Ya0J.jpg","credit_id":"5bda5232c3a36807850036d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2165908,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Susanne Gschwender","original_name":"Susanne Gschwender","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bda523e92514153fb003688","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qAbunGMZpCt4L3VyAMQgcuuVvFJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":721}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-12-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
