David's world changes when he attends the comedy show of a female comic, Valerie, who touches on grim topics such as sexual assault and drug abuse. After the show, he puts it in his mind that he needs to \"save\" her by showing her compassion and being someone who will protect her; this act of \"saving\" being what he needs to create meaning in his life. All the while, David's friends are going through their own existential crises, but without the same amount of self-awareness and/or irrationality. Donald, the failing comedian, Chelsea, David's neglected girlfriend, Lydia, the sexually frustrated nag, and Kevin, the God-fearing idealist, struggle to keep their own lives together while trying to figure out what is wrong with David.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":"/mZilQ21msj4d9ddXMZNPZuudyMw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Absurd","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2167856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Randall Brammer","original_name":"Randall Brammer","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5bde3ae50e0a26058d01a0d1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2167857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kimberly Hamilton","original_name":"Kimberly Hamilton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5bde3afb0e0a26058d01a0ff","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2167859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aaron Patrick Lenyear","original_name":"Aaron Patrick Lenyear","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bde3b0fc3a3682b3901ab50","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7966360","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mZilQ21msj4d9ddXMZNPZuudyMw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
