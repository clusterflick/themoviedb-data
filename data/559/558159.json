All services transferred there with the completion of High Speed One - the UK’s first high-speed railway line (running between the Channel Tunnel and London).  Prior to that, from 1994 to 2007 Eurostar trains ran over the former Southern Railway lines into Waterloo International.  In 2004, Video 125 produced a Driver’s eye view of the route from Paris Gare du Nord via Lille and the Channel Tunnel and the first section of HS1 but running into London Waterloo International via Fawkham Junction. As Video 125 produced a NEW Driver’s eye view in 2007 showing the current line into St Pancras International (from Brussels Midi) we withdrew the Waterloo production from sale.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":"/aNyKBQifnzGszlRWXt0JO0TBJXM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70985,"logo_path":null,"name":"Video 125","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2004-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eurostar: Paris to London Waterloo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zVS8vp66aKGxJHSkp7jU42EK5bX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aNyKBQifnzGszlRWXt0JO0TBJXM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2004-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Eurostar Driver's eye view into Waterloo preview","key":"VP0OZdz-0IY","published_at":"2013-03-10T18:33:04.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"5bda2d0c0e0a2603bb000757"}]}}}
