According to some theological scholars, the film hides a metaphorical evocative code of a satanic ritual. But perhaps David Fleas only followed the manifesto of the Dadaist movement, between anarchist, nihilistic and sarcastic ideas, giving voice to the search for that absolute freedom that art demands.","popularity":0.1153,"poster_path":"/msmo91WhevyrUiaq6ZdDq8e3Txj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122736,"logo_path":null,"name":"TetroVideo","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United
