The people of Shilda were once welcome at the courts of princes all over the world, but back at the Shilda castle work remained and had to be carried out by the women of the town. The women grew tired of this and called their men back. After many foolish decisions, the townspeople were victims of their own devices, and eventually set fire to their own city. The fire destroyed everything, and the citizens of Shilda fled out into the world.","popularity":0.1869,"poster_path":"/xTmffTZvJBPPVj9RIMCJSUIrmqe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55763,"logo_path":null,"name":"DEFA-Studio für Trickfilme","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1961-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Strange History of the Citizens of Shilda","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz Kutschera","original_name":"Franz Kutschera","popularity":0.0878,"profile_path":"/sUqeOJTww9xp9ulWbHn98M2rzmd.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"609bbaf98dbc330040828f11","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2291845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ina Rarisch","original_name":"Ina Rarisch","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"609bbb210f0da50058fd69b0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1832706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siegfried Göhler","original_name":"Siegfried Göhler","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"609bbb342222f6004180630d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1740468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hermann Stövesand","original_name":"Hermann Stövesand","popularity":0.0575,"profile_path":"/5MN4ZriRCpTXeSM2Wr6VgQ0Ki0p.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"609bbb432222f6002aff8667","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1784923,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jörg d'Bomba","original_name":"Jörg d'Bomba","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"609bbb4fec455200299611f6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1469713,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Werner Krauße","original_name":"Werner Krauße","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"609bbb5f2a210c00583b113f","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":23026,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Hohensee","original_name":"Wolfgang Hohensee","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609bba3e28d7fe0057725e7b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2404706,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johannes Hempel","original_name":"Johannes Hempel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609bba1b4202280042a4260f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2010216,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Wolfgang Schiebel","original_name":"Wolfgang Schiebel","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609bba55f706de0027c39582","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1770270,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Werner Kohlert","original_name":"Werner Kohlert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609bba48c51acd003fb76435","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2404706,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johannes Hempel","original_name":"Johannes Hempel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d717c41c5ada5001391c4b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1315980","wikidata_id":"Q106716868","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xTmffTZvJBPPVj9RIMCJSUIrmqe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":529}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1961-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
