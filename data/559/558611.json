The project is based on two coordinates. It is based on the character of Hari in Andrej Tarkovsky's film Solaris, who is now the central figure (after Nana from Jean-Luc Godard's Vivre sa Vie in X NaNa / Subroutine, and Giuliana from Il Deserto Rosso in X Love Scenes); at the same time Crash Site / My_Never_Ending_Burial_Plot represents an attempt to close the cycle of X Characters by putting a symbolic end to the lives (more accurately, the afterlife) of the film characters concerned. Whether or not this attempt is successful remains, for the time being, an open question.","popularity":0.0505,"poster_path":"/8UGoE8Fh9PPDwwd3zs5DTqG1Kra.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crash Site/My_Never_Ending_Burial_Plot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1156059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irina Kastrinidis","original_name":"Irina Kastrinidis","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/bBedUCb1aGl4hIcFqSq3cLc9eom.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67a8e1b2df55e8f213f13850","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1454472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominic Oley","original_name":"Dominic Oley","popularity":0.1275,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67a8e1c106bd0cefa6e071fb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1613114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judith van der Werff","original_name":"Judith van der Werff","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":"/gXpgtw8lawJLw7dyZJE0SfTCenh.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67a8e1cfb9953f8b3af11da0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2202053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gudrun Gut","original_name":"Gudrun Gut","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"67a8e1de2287f3b917c8ce2b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5236647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erika Hasselberg","original_name":"Erika Hasselberg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"67a8e1ee2287f3b917c8ce3e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1201976,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Dana Bieler","original_name":"Dana Bieler","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"67a8e20108dff90318f1181f","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1504543,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Constanze Ruhm","original_name":"Constanze Ruhm","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bdcc2d10e0a262847007d84","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1504543,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Constanze Ruhm","original_name":"Constanze Ruhm","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a8e150bf0a9f6f54e09e38","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1752897,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dirk Lütter","original_name":"Dirk Lütter","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a8e16006bd0cefa6e071c4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1504543,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Constanze Ruhm","original_name":"Constanze Ruhm","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a8e172de283c900ec8d6d5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1563595,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Christine Lang","original_name":"Christine Lang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a8e18c2287f3b917c8cdcf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3388630,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ekkehard Ehlers","original_name":"Ekkehard Ehlers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a8e19e2287f3b917c8cde0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8UGoE8Fh9PPDwwd3zs5DTqG1Kra.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
