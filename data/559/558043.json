Mozart and the talented Italian librettist Lorenzo da Ponte. Based on Molière's Don Juan, the two-act dramma giocoso premiered in October 1787 at Prague's state theater to rave reviews. The 2017 Festival d'Aix-en-Provence brought Mozart's fabulously devious work to the stage once more in a production by stage director Jean-François Sivadie. Starring Philippe Sly (Don Giovanni), Nahuel di Pierro (Leporello), and Eleonora Buratto (Donna Anna), the excellent performance featured the acclaimed maestro Jérémie Rhorer at the head of the period instrument ensemble Le Cercle de l'Harmonie.","popularity":0.0712,"poster_path":"/kR3ci2Wi7tIopoa2Q92mR81LjRz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don Giovanni","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2148228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Sly","original_name":"Philippe Sly","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Don Giovanni","credit_id":"5bd9a682925141155700d83f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pavol Breslik","original_name":"Pavol Breslik","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":"/1klDGmAOvQLE7Xrz951vRZZDXuZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ottavio","credit_id":"5bd9a68c0e0a26507200dff3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1629184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nahuel Di Pierro","original_name":"Nahuel Di Pierro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/kJz1r1Enm3hUSUnYkC8EuPQ42Jx.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Leporello","credit_id":"5bd9a693c3a3683cd000ec41","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2165462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eleonora Buratto","original_name":"Eleonora Buratto","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/syJNNEUdk3kj9AtQw8Vd0soLZb1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Anna","credit_id":"5bd9a69ec3a3683cef00e5d4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1564360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabel Leonard","original_name":"Isabel Leonard","popularity":0.0243,"profile_path":"/xOqgibj4pXH0de6CNhKU44XciUs.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Elvira","credit_id":"5bd9a6a6c3a3683cd700f0ab","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1755306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julie Fuchs","original_name":"Julie Fuchs","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/32KiHf2k0MXWtMXTdBJXpvSmfri.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Zerlina","credit_id":"636eb437813831008b7bf7eb","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2232901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Krzysztof Baczyk","original_name":"Krzysztof Baczyk","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Masetto","credit_id":"636eb4419bcd0f007c8c5028","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2694848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Leigh","original_name":"David Leigh","popularity":0.065,"profile_path":"/4YJJJ68PaYpMQSQuMoeHGfpHvwp.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Commendatore","credit_id":"636eb45081383100abf5d1ea","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1124439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-François Sivadier","original_name":"Jean-François Sivadier","popularity":0.1088,"profile_path":"/9EiDZLCyu6zwhyh3KXvi1JFpSTs.jpg","credit_id":"636eb3cb9bcd0f00c203c3b4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2174993,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jérémie Rhorer","original_name":"Jérémie Rhorer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/bEhCGtV1VNSli5X8ivQATxhszht.jpg","credit_id":"636eb40021621b0091124364","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":821,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kR3ci2Wi7tIopoa2Q92mR81LjRz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":547}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
