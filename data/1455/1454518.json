KabbaLAmobile, commissioned by Los Angeles’ Museum of Contemporary Art and the Mark Taper Forum in 1984, was performed in the Department of Water & Power parking lot. Seven expert drivers and cars from Tom Anthony’s Precision Driving Team and music by performance artist The Dark Bob support Rosenthal’s text. While the cars dance and perform stunts in Kabbalistic formations, Rosenthal chants and declaims both twelfth-century Kabbalistic poetry and copy from automotive magazines in order to show how materialism has supplanted spiritual values in our culture.","popularity":0.098,"poster_path":"/Aqa3Mp8UpM07ZUO2KD7gco11glb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"KabbaLAmobile","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":126981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Rosenthal","original_name":"Rachel Rosenthal","popularity":0.0885,"profile_path":"/hvGMrYMPn8bJlBJzcOLmoMdajHm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67e430a00ee53d4e71f0d0c5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5329578,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Kent Arnold","original_name":"James Kent Arnold","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e430bbcd4c4a62d0dc4e2b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Aqa3Mp8UpM07ZUO2KD7gco11glb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cannot find an exact release date for either the performance that this film documents or the film itself, but Rosenthal's website, which sells DVDs of this film, dates it to 1984.","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
