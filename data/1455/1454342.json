It’s 120°F (48°C), the sun is blazing hot and there’s not a single tree to hide under. You are covered from head to toe in white apparel in an attempt to conceal yourself from the scorching sun. The only sounds you can hear are those of your own footsteps along the burning asphalt. When the wind picks up, sand whips any exposed part of your body like needles.  Welcome to the Badwater 135. A grueling 135 mile race that starts at Badwater Basin - the lowest point in the U.S (-282 feet below sea level) and ends at the highest point in the contiguous United States, Mount Whitney. That’s three mountain ranges the runners have to cross before reaching the finish line. All under 48 hours.","popularity":0.0492,"poster_path":"/uRzJqcUqkcHxmPsnXy7rIZFX7HT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":257528,"logo_path":"/n9fu2aUg7QJSfghpHct8biFok0Q.png","name":"Monkey Wrench
