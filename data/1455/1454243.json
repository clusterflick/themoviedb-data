Clad in 'Rave Culture' clothing, these mercenaries infiltrate a facility where other agents from their team have been held and interrogated by enemy forces. With help from agents on the inside (recognizable by their 'Rave Culture' wrist tattoos), they secretly give the captured agents earpieces that connect them to the rest of the team. The agents are interrogated by a dangerous enemy man when Hanegem and his hacker team connect to their earpieces and play music into their ears, empowering the agents to defeat their captors and make their escape.","popularity":0.0991,"poster_path":"/lYfbxzS9XiUEZ2x4bJLC7Z0Ws3k.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":257511,"logo_path":null,"name":"UBERcut","origin_country":""},{"id":257512,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kraftstoff","origin_country":""},{"id":30216,"logo_path":"/AwgLu0qw2UifWdDYExBNlZXWwx.png","name":"Sunrise
