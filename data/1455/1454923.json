The dead man doesn't speak, yet stories are woven around him. Just like in a novel, the characters create their own fiction, a story to tell to children, to society, or a way to imagine the missing passages of recent Argentine history.  Félix the pool attendant and Kike the subway employee, both writers, take us, not without humor, to a narrative beyond the daily life: What remains to be resolved? How do you clean a pool full of frogs? Who is the dead man in the trunk? Is he one of the many people who disappeared during the dictatorship?","popularity":0.1546,"poster_path":"/eq5XuYD0kO17lQELwzwP4nAkrS1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The pool boy, the metro delegate and the corpse","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le pisciniste, l'employé de métro et le cadavre","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5333182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kike Ferrari","original_name":"Kike Ferrari","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67e674abf8cba94bbcba51d2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5333216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Félix Bruzzone","original_name":"Félix Bruzzone","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67e67ac6027e737406004117","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1145487,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eduardo de la Serna","original_name":"Eduardo de la Serna","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e65736f8cba94bbcba4bd2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1145487,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eduardo de la Serna","original_name":"Eduardo de la Serna","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e68b1c3e65c8ea88ba4199","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5333250,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eduardo de la serna","original_name":"Eduardo de la serna","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e68b4b030c246b1e109922","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5333252,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Guido Cabella","original_name":"Guido Cabella","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e68ba533a74341e310edb5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1145487,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eduardo de la Serna","original_name":"Eduardo de la Serna","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e68bd9f8cba94bbcba57ec","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4139660,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gastón Pereyra","original_name":"Gastón Pereyra","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e68c47b8fc39899610d0bb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1354677,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Martín Hsu","original_name":"Juan Martín Hsu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/koFxUGKy5wchSY5RUksuk40coXP.jpg","credit_id":"67e68c93027e737406004834","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":1140,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eq5XuYD0kO17lQELwzwP4nAkrS1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cinélatino Film Festival ","release_date":"2025-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
