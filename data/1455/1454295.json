They were also tempted to create content inside the Khadra Tower and wanted to go viral like Steps Devils. But as they were about to enter the building, Intan refused and eventually went home with the agreement that she would pick up her friends. But that night was the last night Intan saw Dimas, Fandy, and Elsa. The three of them never left the Green Tower again.","popularity":0.1713,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Menara Terkutuk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2979130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dosma Hazenbosch","original_name":"Dosma Hazenbosch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/r43FVi1rYAFbXznm5pPSRVvDJMl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67e38767e28af41cfc762c42","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1935459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricky Wattimena","original_name":"Ricky Wattimena","popularity":0.1193,"profile_path":"/sGARetvwtfbzu8v3qaTpF3CZyXW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67e3876f7db9e70c47dc9386","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2100655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadira Octova","original_name":"Nadira Octova","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/pn0jUGlzhfgs0jEGOI3CUl4DLZ2.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67e387777db9e70c47dc938c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1629249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Halim","original_name":"Albert Halim","popularity":0.0464,"profile_path":"/rPCqMXpS6LgTXN5VfrmgYBtvlz1.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67e387807db9e70c47dc9390","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1974981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gibran Marten","original_name":"Gibran Marten","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/h1WJfSVxskw0M4ZNLmQhyQrvBdZ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67e38787e28af41cfc762c58","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2120859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erika Carlina","original_name":"Erika Carlina","popularity":0.2853,"profile_path":"/aretQEax2TdtnAxUrSkW8t3nxU6.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67e387927b7313b5aef09c07","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3306172,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Etienne Caesar","original_name":"Etienne Caesar","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e387b516a3c5c224f09c5c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2295793,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenny Gulardi","original_name":"Kenny Gulardi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e387c37db9e70c47dc93b4","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2584505,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stanley Meulen","original_name":"Stanley Meulen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e387d00ee53d4e71f0abee","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2295903,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ridho Brado","original_name":"Ridho Brado","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e387daec98bf0a0d760418","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2295793,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenny Gulardi","original_name":"Kenny Gulardi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e387e57b7313b5aef09c11","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5328475,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Desy Anggraini","original_name":"Desy Anggraini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e387fae28af41cfc762c80","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
