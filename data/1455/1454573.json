Using the university's molecular biology supercomputer, this was a project by then UCLA engineering/design student Dave Curlender and UCLA medical research doctoral candidate David S. Goodsell. This finished project premiered to the public at the collaborative event On the Threshold (see “On the Threshold” promotional video) and was one of a number of early computer graphic works screened at EZTV, first as a work in progress and then numerous times over the years. Most recently, this 1985 piece was used as part of the finale for the opening of the Getty Museum's Pacific Standard Time.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/lpOOorsI5Xb6KzDTtcKyCaIHMde.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Larger Than Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5329751,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dave Curlender","original_name":"Dave Curlender","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e445a00ee53d4e71f0d81a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5329753,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David S.
