Eighteen years after being abandoned, Joseph enters a church, not to repent, but to confront the man who left him behind. Inside the confessional, Father Eli is forced into a reckoning he can no longer escape. As old wounds resurface and the line between justice and vengeance blurs, a single question remains: when the dust settles, will anything be left standing?  Starring Will Rodriguez (Bird Eater, AACTA Award-winning film), The Olive Tree is a visually striking black-and-white psychological thriller that transforms faith into a weapon and confession into a battlefield. Tense, provocative, and unrelenting—this is no ordinary act of forgiveness.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Eighteen years after being abandoned, Joseph enters a church, not to repent, but to confront the man who left him behind.","title":"The Olive Tree","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
