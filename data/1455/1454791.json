From the small island of Guam to the international stage of FestPAC, the documentary showcases the inspiring story of cultural revival, resilience, and the ongoing journey to reclaim and preserve a tradition that belongs to the CHamoru people.  Once silenced by colonization, the CHamoru people rise—through song, chant, and dance. At the heart of this revival stands Master Frank Rabon, who dared to reimagine a lost tradition, giving it back to the generations who longed for it. From the shores of Guam to the world stage of FestPAC the CHamoru people reclaim their identity, their language, their pride. Through every movement, there’s a dance and with every dance they declare: We are still here and this is Something to Call Our Own.","popularity":0.1022,"poster_path":"/ryBhaBYXPEZLnBQyfM7caNqwbW0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Chamorro","iso_639_1":"ch","name":"Finu' Chamorro"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A CHamoru dance story","title":"Something to Call Our Own","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":948,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ryBhaBYXPEZLnBQyfM7caNqwbW0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1691,"name":"dance"},{"id":230995,"name":"guam"},{"id":313168,"name":"chamorro"},{"id":349207,"name":"chamoru"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Hafa Adai | Something to Call Our Own | Clips","key":"obtobTKm-jU","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2025-03-19T08:00:44.000Z","id":"67e4aa00421eb8c331ba2af8"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"What is FestPAC? | Something to Call Our Own | Clips","key":"0g-357LMoSw","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2025-03-12T02:00:02.000Z","id":"67e4aa0e421eb8c331ba2afc"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Official Trailer | Something to Call Our Own | Premieres March 14th, 2025","key":"kxAIMvYSlvM","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-03-02T20:00:32.000Z","id":"67e4a9be421eb8c331ba2adb"}]}}}
