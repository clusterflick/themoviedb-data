Shinji Nagumo seems to lead a charmed life amidst the inherent dangers of building a skyscraper. Unfortunately, everyone around Nagumo has been rather unlucky - fatally so.\r It's up to Subaru Sumeragi, the most powerful medium in Japan, to piece together the clues before there's another death. Are the accidents due to just bad luck and random chance, or is something more sinister at work?\r Subaru will have to work fast, because the lucky Mr. Nagumo has made many enemies.
