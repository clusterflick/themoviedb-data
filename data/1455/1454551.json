But today feels different—Chloe is at her breaking point. Fueled by frustration, Chloe exacts revenge on her co-workers one by one, using only the power of her brain—or perhaps something else entirely. A hilarious takedown of corporate-speak and return-to-office mandates, the film underscores one glaring truth: this whole meeting could have been an email.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"TCHBAE (This Could Have Been an Email)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
