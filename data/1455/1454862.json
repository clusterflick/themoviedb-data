Women were once safe, but now each morning's train carries another brutally butchered body. Without a motive, the police are helpless against this psychotic killer.  With nowhere else to turn, Mirei Hidaka, a psychic \"postcognitive\" is called in. Using her sense of touch, Mirei can feel the currents of the past and has the ability to witness murders hours or days after they've been committed. But just as the threads are slowly starting to come together, Mirei's own life is in jeopardy!  It's now up to Subaru Sumeragi, Japan's most powerful medium, to save the day. But this case won't be solved until the separate strands of destiny have been re-woven into a new pattern - one that binds Subaru, Mirei, and a psychotic murderer.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/AuZeZ5wt9qfUSLQvs7fOW3nouwg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tokyo Babylon 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AuZeZ5wt9qfUSLQvs7fOW3nouwg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rZL6ehliyr9Hs0mpVDP8R8ih3H5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
