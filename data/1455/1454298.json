The long middle portion of each take consists of almost imperceptible camera movements across the sky while the sound track continues to record people talking on the street, presumably in perfect sync with the image. The film refocuses our attention from what weâ€™re most accustomed to looking at to a world almost of pure color.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/3ruW4pX4C9sMde7pxpIZ1a8ryHZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sound in Synch, Parts I and II","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Sound in Sync, Parts I and II","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2836485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tatsu Aoki","original_name":"Tatsu Aoki","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e38af1e28af41cfc762d9a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3ruW4pX4C9sMde7pxpIZ1a8ryHZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
