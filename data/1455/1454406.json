The piece explores what remains of a poem when its language is removed, and how images might interact with each other in similar or different ways to words. It asks whether rhyme, rhythm, sibilance, or dissonance, might be effectively created by juxtaposing images. It also asks whether arranging images might create a sense of authorship, intentionality, or a tone of voice, in the way that arranging words might. Finally, Four Poems invites the viewer to consider how they might ‘read’ a poem – does a reading have to occur from top-to-bottom, or might new interpretations be possible when the moving parts of the poem can all be seen at once?","popularity":0.0982,"poster_path":"/47vfHBhXV8CIBaaq0tjjp8pmABe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Four Poems","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3408047,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Power","original_name":"Dan Power","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/s934Vt4SW75N7xR0fIZW9WmGEM1.jpg","credit_id":"67e3fd4d440f311ace7633cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3408047,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Power","original_name":"Dan Power","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/s934Vt4SW75N7xR0fIZW9WmGEM1.jpg","credit_id":"67e3fd5f3dbe3ab1f2f058f4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.682,"height":2475,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/47vfHBhXV8CIBaaq0tjjp8pmABe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1688}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":496,"name":"poetry"},{"id":208733,"name":"video art"},{"id":258226,"name":"visual poetry"},{"id":284176,"name":"animals & nature"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Off-Page vispo exhibition, at Many Studios in Glasgow","release_date":"2025-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
