The strike, deep within the toxic mercury mine, lasted for eleven long days, during which the whole village showed its solidarity with the men protesting underground. The mine was the heart of Almaden, around which everything revolved – until it longer existed. The mercury mine was closed for good at the beginning of the 21st century. As a consequence, the area has experienced mass unemployment and slow decline.","popularity":0.0856,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5974,"logo_path":"/vgPUbUDwVGL1ruiPv2KFtjh75UD.png","name":"Making Movies","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2024-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"11 Underground","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1208930,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chico Pereira","original_name":"Chico Pereira","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6797458164431257a38f49cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":132028,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kaarle Aho","original_name":"Kaarle Aho","popularity":0.0747,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679745c6df4b0191ce2aff69","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5206234,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kai Norberg","original_name":"Kai Norberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679745d5df4b0191ce2aff7c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":132028,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kaarle Aho","original_name":"Kaarle Aho","popularity":0.0747,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679745e664431257a38f49f2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1208930,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chico Pereira","original_name":"Chico Pereira","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679745f616f0d960df23a9dd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1883995,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nick Gibbon","original_name":"Nick Gibbon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6797460909c252e3ab23c846","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1274711,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Okku Nuutilainen","original_name":"Okku Nuutilainen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/xGBPFCeDfAyKZW8zSDoQ1forbjB.jpg","credit_id":"67974616df4b0191ce2aff88","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1817902,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Julian Schwanitz","original_name":"Julian Schwanitz","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67974625702f492f478f4218","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
