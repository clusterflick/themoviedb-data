Britain prepares for the coming invasion. But the war is a dull affair for Arthur Roundtree, a young man serving in the Home Guard. He dreams of action and adventure, but he remains stuck in a small, sleepy English village miles away from war due to a medical condition. However, when an extra-terrestrial creature crashes on the outskirts of the village, a training exercise suddenly turns into a deadly game of cat and mouse. Soon, Arthur and his companions realise they are fighting for their lives and to save the entire Galaxy!","popularity":0.115,"poster_path":"/mhDGjskIEpKbeXnpBBsbqaugObq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":213061,"logo_path":null,"name":"TrashHouse Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Doom Busters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1457604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Clunie","original_name":"Margaret Clunie","popularity":0.5228,"profile_path":"/enmPDhrWhZBMpJInxjuQQYroCK5.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67984573c7b01b72c7242863","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1457606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy Renouf","original_name":"Timothy Renouf","popularity":0.154,"profile_path":"/7po8BdFlkJmLheLVqB2QgdnqoPp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"679845855dc8b3b72d2aebe1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3009693,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessica Webber","original_name":"Jessica Webber","popularity":0.1289,"profile_path":"/yzNa38fAOpZD0je9mwoWJGcUoPJ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6798458cba4f941f448f2768","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2212880,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Bailey","original_name":"Tom Bailey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67984598ba4f941f448f2778","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2212933,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack McHenry","original_name":"Jack McHenry","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679845ca013209f8918f77d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2212933,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack McHenry","original_name":"Jack McHenry","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679845cf013209f8918f77d8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29924789","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1504,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mhDGjskIEpKbeXnpBBsbqaugObq.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Glasgow FrightFest 2025","release_date":"2025-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
