The forest is dressed in its beautiful, white winter dress, and on the frozen forest lake, the youth is frolicking to their hearts' content. Among the happy skaters is the young sculptor Erik Elmer. He has left his studio in the big city and is finding new courage out here on the shiny surface of the ice. It is not long before he makes the acquaintance of a charming young lady - Ethel Birk is her name - and soon they are racing hand in hand across the ice. Out here we also meet a couple of good, old acquaintances, Fyrtårnet and Bivognen. They have found a way of life by renting out skates and giving lessons in the noble sport of skating.
