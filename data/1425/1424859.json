The park was originally purchased by the city in 1944.  A time when the park was used for Victory Gardens throughout World War II, this time, over 500 gardens were planted, providing food and nourishment to the community.  Moving toward possibility, curiosity, and desire, the film decodes the promise of public parks without sacrificing the pleasures of lingering and looking.
