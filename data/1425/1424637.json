Onboard were 69 Ryukyuan passengers who reached an area inhabited by the Paiwan people. However, some Ryukyuans were killed in a tragic incident that later became known as the Mudan Incident. This event was used as a pretext for Japan’s invasion of Taiwan (the 1874 Taiwan Expedition) and also influenced Japan’s annexation of Ryukyu, significantly shaping the geopolitical landscape of East Asia.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2025-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ocean Elegy: The Tragedies of Mudan and Ryukyu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","title":"Sevalitan","type":"original title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2542760,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sean Hao-Hsiang Hu","original_name":"Sean Hao-Hsiang Hu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6797a8873ae355c4788f3e2e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2542760,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sean Hao-Hsiang Hu","original_name":"Sean Hao-Hsiang Hu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6797a931013209f8918f615d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35504269","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cinema at Sea - Okinawa Pan-Pacific International Film Festival (Opening Film)","release_date":"2025-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
