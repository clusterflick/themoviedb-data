He asks his boss, Subroto, to investigate and take action against them. Subroto, who feels that he is committing fraud with Karta et al, negotiates to overthrow Sumarna by using Nani, a widow of a dragger. Nani succeeds in taking Surmarna away from his wife, Hayati, and makes Sumarna also commit corruption. Sumarna is arrested and sentenced to five years.  Hayati, who is divorced, lives in the village with her child in her parents' house. Because this provides a good education for her child, she returns to Jakarta. She meets Amat, Sumarna's driver, who then invites her to the house of Dul ​​and Mirah, a vegetable seller. Hayati sells rujak.  After five years, Sumarna is released from prison, while Subroto et al are sent to prison because their corruption is exposed. When walking in front of Dul's house, Amat recognizes him.","popularity":0.052,"poster_path":"/dXqSTZibWKsWzJRsbemV9skxZ5S.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":251683,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tandjong Trading Coy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1955-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tahu Sama Tahu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2963241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ermina Zaenah","original_name":"Ermina Zaenah","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/gfrCrxbIRxn15M4vvhiUTsWk6qP.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6799be2e97540c9fc927997e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2075864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chatir Harro","original_name":"Chatir Harro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/rI9gD20w4rqHCNDhIPWDUeHwQXg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"679907bb192115901e8f7fcd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1894399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aminah","original_name":"Aminah","popularity":0.1818,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"679907c55dc8b3b72d2b0a58","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2941074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"S Poniman","original_name":"S Poniman","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":"/2XssfjOAfwXPwdQ5YZnL4Kf1b8w.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"679907de702f492f478f8b9d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1276963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zainal Abidin","original_name":"Zainal Abidin","popularity":0.1063,"profile_path":"/dPdVCkQdEOBxoSvux7CTfO8AEIu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"679907e4702f492f478f8ba3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4365556,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mustajab Budhrasa","original_name":"Mustajab Budhrasa","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/dDLwyUF2XK1Ncy4n3KHjFyZF78O.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"679907f4ba4f941f448f45d4","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dXqSTZibWKsWzJRsbemV9skxZ5S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","release_dates":[{"certification":"17+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"id","note":"","release_date":"1955-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
