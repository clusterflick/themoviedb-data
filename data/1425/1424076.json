The time boundary constitutes a reserve army of work, whose time is considered in excess and wasted and therefore easily exploited. Similar to the case of colonial extraction of natural resources, the time boundary is nothing more than an act of theft, theft of time.  WAITING is an experimental film born from a conversation between a director and an anthropologist. WAITING explores the theme of waiting through the testimonies of three migrant men in Europe. The testimonies on waiting come in different forms; writing of letters, painting and poetic research. The aim of the film is to integrate academic knowledge into migrant stories and make them accessible to a wider audience through the combination of words and images.\r Dagmawi Yimer, Shahram Khosravi, Salif Keita, Marco Paci","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"WAITING","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3729487,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dagmawi Yimer","original_name":"Dagmawi Yimer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6796497c0e1e0486d62b043b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5204517,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shahram Khosravi","original_name":"Shahram Khosravi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67964997013209f8918f233c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
