Люди Майдану","overview":"Sparked by the aftermath of the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election, Ukrainians began a series of protests against fraud and towards genuine democracy. History remembers it as the Orange Revolution, and here Sergii Masloboishchykov interrogates its foundation and motivations. By filming miners, villagers and students across Ukraine, the film maps a geography of the vast country that bridges the gap between East and West. Together they create a political argument for Ukrainian society, which, as the film states clearly, is a source of power.","popularity":0.0468,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":251589,"logo_path":null,"name":"Inspiration Films","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2005-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nevseremos!
