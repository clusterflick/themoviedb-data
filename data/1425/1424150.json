When he does so, the giver of this great gift has disappeared. Poor Batty Bill endeavors to leave the baby everywhere, but without success. Ultimately he is, as he thinks, more successful, and is able to give the baby over to the police. A little later he is about to be married, when the police come and insist upon him taking his child. The indignation of his prospective wife is very amusing, and the whole thing causes a great joke from end to end.","popularity":0.1149,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":135315,"logo_path":null,"name":"Société des Etablissements L.
