Antipathy is replaced by mutual obsession, which has irreversible consequences. Masloboishchykov’s second film school project, which screened at Semaine de la critique, is based on the short novel Lagoftalm by the lesser-known writer, Dmitry Bakin. The military setting is conveyed through a combination of aggressive tensity and comic music, making it look and seem more like a prison or a madhouse.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":251597,"logo_path":null,"name":"The High Courses of Script Writers and Film Directors (HCFDS)","origin_country":""},{"id":4581,"logo_path":"/p858ADU9O67a7ageVEjsk18jqak.png","name":"Dovzhenko Film Studios","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Different One","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Inoi","type":"transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Inoy","type":"Transliteration alt."}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5207685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denis Karasiov","original_name":"Denis Karasiov","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6798016db921c548d82adb24","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2403662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lev Somov","original_name":"Лев Сомов","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/1FruMevG3FtkA5o5i0O0LDz4t1v.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"67980174702f492f478f61e5","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1480338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serhii Masloboishchykov","original_name":"Сергій Маслобойщиков","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/zIkm1YhJS25cnMfBUkSAvSuY2Pq.jpg","credit_id":"6797ffdf0a30d6d059242ac8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1480338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serhii Masloboishchykov","original_name":"Сергій Маслобойщиков","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/zIkm1YhJS25cnMfBUkSAvSuY2Pq.jpg","credit_id":"6797ffe9a6e41283f12b4e04","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5207667,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alexander Shumovicth","original_name":"Alexander Shumovicth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6797fff39ca029099c2b25fd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5207668,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rosa Lorman","original_name":"Rosa Lorman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6797fffca6e41283f12b4e0f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5207669,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Eugenia Lissetskaya","original_name":"Eugenia Lissetskaya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679800060a30d6d059242ad5","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1602235,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Serhii Vachi","original_name":"Сергій Вачі","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6798000f9ca029099c2b2608","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092911,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alfred Schnittke","original_name":"Альфред Шнитке","popularity":0.1619,"profile_path":"/9nMpPfn2ZySNMowVYcetQ1PQreA.jpg","credit_id":"6798001909c252e3ab23ec8f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1421762,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Viacheslav Nazarov","original_name":"Вʼячеслав Назаров","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/OGb7KLz3P7J8Ttv2bCYu6TV2lY.jpg","credit_id":"6798006aa6e41283f12b4e29","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":729,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ecU8aXgk98lIYL1yXEjPiMiPuBJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1296}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cannes Film Festival 1990","release_date":"1990-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2025-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
