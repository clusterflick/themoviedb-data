No matter how far-fetched it may sound, what he says is actually a reality in the parallel universe that existed millions of years ago. As Tapdig says, the tribal chief entrusts his son Dudu with the sacred eggs inherited from his grandfather, and instructs him to protect them, warning him that a great disaster will occur if these eggs break. However, by chance, one of the eggs falls from Dudu's hands and breaks, and Dudu is transported to the present day. Having fallen into the modern era, Dudu devotes all his energy to searching for the surviving egg (found by the archaeologist). In this, he is helped by the swindler Magsud, a journalist he has just befriended. However, the results are not at all as expected.","popularity":0.1852,"poster_path":"/mbuVnU5Urg17uw0fUXFwWpid2Gp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":251473,"logo_path":"/1o9sebAAaEZXyghijVRjjvme66P.png","name":"Adiloglu
