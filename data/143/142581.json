Carted out of New York City in a shuttle full of oddball characters, Billy and the rest of the guinea pigs, affectionately referred to as \"Normals,\" camp out at hidden research facility. When not popping pills, being tagged, drained of blood, prodded, poked and color-coded, they are telling horror stories of previous tests or generally getting on each other's nerves.

Billy realizes that there is no such thing as \"normal.\"","popularity":0.8577,"poster_path":"/xzxYptfET383oDawHx04VN2WbW1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Normals","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryan Greenberg","original_name":"Bryan Greenberg","popularity":0.788,"profile_path":"/2dlE6uMX0OTB1O3T8ZB8xHhmrIS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Billy Schine","credit_id":"52fe4ae59251416c750f19ed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Hedaya","original_name":"Dan Hedaya","popularity":0.9669,"profile_path":"/evL3mV8hNIjZOb1XG3qtgmiTgS5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ragnar","credit_id":"52fe4ae59251416c750f19f1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":76999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jess Weixler","original_name":"Jess Weixler","popularity":0.6695,"profile_path":"/2X0PjIXMLPjm7opUGEq8X5lvqjV.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Gretchen","credit_id":"52fe4ae59251416c750f19f5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Pais","original_name":"Josh Pais","popularity":0.6637,"profile_path":"/uH90fGfLLzYCX02yOW3kH4LMO7n.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dr. Honeysack","credit_id":"52fe4ae59251416c750f19f9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102445,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Sayles","original_name":"John Sayles","popularity":0.2707,"profile_path":"/iFGXKTs2eDfBQjhvYoaWtdUaWbU.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dr. Marx","credit_id":"622a218712c6040046154553","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1117499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Patrick Connors","original_name":"Kevin Patrick Connors","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ae59251416c750f19e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1117500,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Christopher Ciancimino","original_name":"Christopher Ciancimino","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ae59251416c750f19e9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1778918","wikidata_id":"Q56703349","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xzxYptfET383oDawHx04VN2WbW1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":540},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/t9DxC57FDpuSekRklK4Nm0oFUZ4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
