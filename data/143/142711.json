When a rescue team was sent into investigate no one was found alive. . . . . . . Cut off from the outside world, the small community gradually become fractured and antagonistic. From out of this dark crucible of malcontent, a killer emerges. In the isolated and disparate group, members are picked off one by one, paranoia ensues and no one is safe. Filmed and edited entirely on location in Antarctica, the story demonstrates that, even in the most inhospitable environment on earth, the most malevolent threat lurks inside ourselves","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":"/nmFVKgS1gQrJD3wGMvkC8ftKgpW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":245258,"logo_path":null,"name":"Perfect View
