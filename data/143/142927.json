The clues seem to point to a rival Nazi white supremacist gang as the culprits, but Lizzie (Hawke's brother's partner in the police force) is not so sure: she suspects a larger conspiracy which involves one of the city's most powerful crime bosses, a man by the name of Garr. As the body count rises, Eric, Lizzie and young Asian gang member Lipo Chung race to uncover the truth behind the murders, before more missing gang members wash up on the beach with missing organs.","popularity":0.7586,"poster_path":"/gGA4ENkiyxKsvj2MI11gXE8180z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1996-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hawk's Vengeance","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Hawk's Revenge - Tödliche Rache","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68559,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gary Daniels","original_name":"Gary Daniels","popularity":0.4591,"profile_path":"/60RqnmK1eAICJgbmA0YtMef6iys.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hawk","credit_id":"52fe4af19251416c750f32cb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jayne Heitmeyer","original_name":"Jayne Heitmeyer","popularity":0.4799,"profile_path":"/7ZcniiFN6e2vYhJms1MaVCfNqE4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lizzie","credit_id":"52fe4af19251416c750f32cf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1118092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cass Magda","original_name":"Cass Magda","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Garr","credit_id":"52fe4af19251416c750f32d3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":180979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Chiang","original_name":"George Chiang","popularity":0.0992,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Lipo","credit_id":"52fe4af19251416c750f32d7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vlasta Vrana","original_name":"Vlasta Vrana","popularity":0.2341,"profile_path":"/z5ujCvCkNv7ikka6tJVaxqegldY.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Duquesne","credit_id":"52fe4af19251416c750f32db","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1118093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Biddle Jr.","original_name":"Charles Biddle Jr.","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Blade","credit_id":"52fe4af19251416c750f32df","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serge Houde","original_name":"Serge Houde","popularity":0.3901,"profile_path":"/40T7A9D9ts3tBP7aKjyJImY5tMZ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Durkee","credit_id":"52fe4af19251416c750f32e3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russell Yuen","original_name":"Russell Yuen","popularity":0.1936,"profile_path":"/yFYpcN2YxJLCFr9p7kaOwunN1Cb.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Yoon","credit_id":"52fe4af19251416c750f32e7","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":92256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Blythe","original_name":"Catherine Blythe","popularity":0.1848,"profile_path":"/xUS0QXUT6av2QSP2gV0wHIx2h9j.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Dr. Rebecca Palmer","credit_id":"52fe4af19251416c750f32eb","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2611344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudia Blondeau","original_name":"Claudia Blondeau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":23,"character":"Girl - Funeral Parlour","credit_id":"64b9a63cab684900ff49ebeb","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":70429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc F.
