When the host dies during filming, the production shuts down. Unbeknownst to the cast and crew, the show’s director planned the host’s death to boost ratings. Dr. Randolf Fairfax (Doug Jones) fears the bloodshed has awoken supernatural spirits that are now hellbent on their own revenge! The crew must try to survive, dodging bullets, ghosts, and scheming television producers (played by Star Trek’s Robert Picardo and Michael Dorn) as they race to find out what is really going on at the end of the road.","popularity":0.9029,"poster_path":"/xIFnFD63t3MufVqtolt2Fy1fo07.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Hunters are Being Hunted","title":"Spirit Hunters","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"1,2,3...
