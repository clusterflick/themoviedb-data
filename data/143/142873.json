Their shots captured on celluloid became the images for such films as Stylemasters, The Forgotten Island of Santosha, Big Wednesday, Pacific Vibrations, Uluwatu and many more. This documentary is a cinematic journey inspired by many of the reels that were lost in the making of these films. Since that time, these reels have resurfaced and are now brought to light. A fusion of rare super 8mm film, photo stills and contemporary interviews blend together to make Chasing the Lotus the most in-depth look at the evolution of the surf culture and surf discovery ever made.","popularity":0.6444,"poster_path":"/pWw9H8K8lOeeNuB5qO0HQXu362w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The lost reels of Weaver and Wills","title":"Chasing the Lotus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Bridges","original_name":"Jeff Bridges","popularity":2.025,"profile_path":"/xms1RAY6q7Lzp7wNeRCB0kzhucn.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"545b2720c3a3685350000d16","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stacy Peralta","original_name":"Stacy Peralta","popularity":0.239,"profile_path":"/mT2TkPs1Yjh2DaJWnYJpcoRwm1H.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"545b272c0e0a26042c000f77","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerry Lopez","original_name":"Gerry Lopez","popularity":0.1394,"profile_path":"/dOHv3wlNb2EuIQj4Hng3op97L50.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"545b2739c3a3685350000d19","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1382221,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gregory Schell","original_name":"Gregory Schell","popularity":0.044,"profile_path":"/9dkD9Uh0vrDoZkve1kSfqeQaRtG.jpg","credit_id":"545b27480e0a261fa9001677","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0857308","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2298,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pWw9H8K8lOeeNuB5qO0HQXu362w.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1532},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g5R7dhZjK9cTa802PApUUFMIWsy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
