Nutrition educator Shira Potash teaches nutrition-based cooking classes to elementary school students in low-income neighborhoods, most of whom are eligible for food stamps. In an attempt to walk a mile in their shoes, Shira and her documentary filmmaker husband embark on the food stamp challenge where they eat on roughly one dollar per meal. Along the way, they consult with food justice activists, nutrition experts, politicians, and ordinary people living on food stamps, all in order to take a deep look at the struggles low-income Americans face every day while trying to put three-square meals on the table.","popularity":0.4168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Is it possible to eat healthy on a food stamp budget?","title":"Food Stamped","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1116303,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shira Potash","original_name":"Shira Potash","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4ace9251416c750eeb37","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":582675,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yoav Potash","original_name":"Yoav Potash","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4ace9251416c750eeb3b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1116303,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shira Potash","original_name":"Shira Potash","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4acd9251416c750eeaf1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":517851,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Yoav Potash","original_name":"Yoav Potash","popularity":0.0906,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4acd9251416c750eeaf7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":517851,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Yoav Potash","original_name":"Yoav Potash","popularity":0.0906,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4acd9251416c750eeafd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1116303,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shira Potash","original_name":"Shira Potash","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ace9251416c750eeb03","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":517851,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Yoav Potash","original_name":"Yoav Potash","popularity":0.0906,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ace9251416c750eeb09","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1116303,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shira Potash","original_name":"Shira Potash","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ace9251416c750eeb0f","department":"Editing","job":"Editorial Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":517853,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ben Ferrer","original_name":"Ben Ferrer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ace9251416c750eeb15","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1116305,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Erin Hudson","original_name":"Erin Hudson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ace9251416c750eeb1b","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":213070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcus Johnson","original_name":"Marcus Johnson","popularity":0.3048,"profile_path":"/fqAZqGw6fm6R3uBRSyCi0OvVWWO.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ace9251416c750eeb21","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1116306,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Roy Wanguhu Kiiru","original_name":"Roy Wanguhu Kiiru","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ace9251416c750eeb27","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1116307,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kory Smith","original_name":"Kory Smith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ace9251416c750eeb2d","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1116308,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Levi Welton","original_name":"Levi Welton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ace9251416c750eeb33","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1667079","wikidata_id":"Q8564308","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
