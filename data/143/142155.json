A 1971 visit to a Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) training camp while on the way back from Cannes resulted in Adachi's most infamous film, the agit-prop documentary Red Army/PFLP: Declaration of World War, which he co-directed with Wakamatsu. Soon after, Adachi joined a splinter cell of the Japanese Red Army in Lebanon, where he stayed from 1974 until he was deported to Japan in 1997 to serve time for passport violations.","popularity":0.1952,"poster_path":"/r3IkQdtabohLoTsC3tK8j5XlD0d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61669,"logo_path":null,"name":"Epileptic","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2011-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It May Be That Beauty Has Strengthened Our Resolve - Masao Adachi","video":false,"vote_average":6.143,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"美が私たちの決断をいっそう強めたのだろう　足立正生","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134812,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Masao Adachi","original_name":"足立正生","popularity":0.3258,"profile_path":"/zKVZDV6EJhAVeYoAXIbnAsjAPMc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5bca475c9251415633017210","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3211524,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Naruhiko Onozawa","original_name":"小野沢稔彦","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67149f3e0cb6252f99089e24","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":567750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philippe Grandrieux","original_name":"Philippe Grandrieux","popularity":0.2917,"profile_path":"/7h8QrUadpwbeHB8VAby5vJmcqh7.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ad19251416c750ef2b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1847537,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Annick Lemonnier","original_name":"Annick Lemonnier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4ae612271ca5003735af7e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":567750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philippe Grandrieux","original_name":"Philippe Grandrieux","popularity":0.2917,"profile_path":"/7h8QrUadpwbeHB8VAby5vJmcqh7.jpg","credit_id":"5f4ae628b2681f0033da2d6e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":567750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philippe Grandrieux","original_name":"Philippe Grandrieux","popularity":0.2917,"profile_path":"/7h8QrUadpwbeHB8VAby5vJmcqh7.jpg","credit_id":"5f4ae630271ca50035363271","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":567750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philippe Grandrieux","original_name":"Philippe Grandrieux","popularity":0.2917,"profile_path":"/7h8QrUadpwbeHB8VAby5vJmcqh7.jpg","credit_id":"5f4ae64365e0a200324cadac","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2700995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Lamoureux","original_name":"Charles Lamoureux","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/qOXRHICHteTf8VvvlayLWg7Ir1y.jpg","credit_id":"5f4ae65212aabc0033a2e0dd","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1046053,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stéphane Thiébaut","original_name":"Stéphane Thiébaut","popularity":0.097,"profile_path":"/tqoN88uYJj7R0gu452aSAVjMKmt.jpg","credit_id":"5f4ae65fb2681f0032d9a409","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1877435,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ferdinand Grandrieux","original_name":"Ferdinand Grandrieux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4ae69174507d0032ac32cc","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2007401","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/swamdX3IIf1QpzUYQP0AJ42Mt6i.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/r3IkQdtabohLoTsC3tK8j5XlD0d.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.525,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pNLz3sh1Wp1oQXXnWWLkA3Fe37n.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":630}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
