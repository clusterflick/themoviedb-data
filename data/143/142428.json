It’s intimate, intense and surprising; romantic but dark. Marla and Sam meet in the restroom of a bar. They talk and ﬂ irt, but this isn’t just a story of boy meets girl.

What happens between Sam and Marla affects them both profoundly — more than love","popularity":0.315,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2012-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Strangest Love Story You've Seen","title":"Marla","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1014916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Ritchard","original_name":"Eddie Ritchard","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/r02Mr0kECtKhKQQH5lCFbuxTTkd.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Marla","credit_id":"52fe4ae09251416c750f0fc1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1117277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dale March","original_name":"Dale March","popularity":0.0896,"profile_path":"/x4mzNDEWRo0cSeLDsA0sseNjdSr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"52fe4ae09251416c750f0fc5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29480,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lani John Tupu","original_name":"Lani John Tupu","popularity":0.5726,"profile_path":"/qeYfpXFFTqbHTPiykB5UPpPmobj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Carlos","credit_id":"52fe4ae09251416c750f0fc9","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1117276,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick King","original_name":"Nick King","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ae09251416c750f0fbd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2365901","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
