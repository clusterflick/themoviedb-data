Over 18 seasons with the Bronx Bombers, despite constant nagging injuries, Mantle managed to hit 536 home runs, twice hitting more than 50 in a season. He finished ten seasons with a batting average of .300 or more and suited up for seven World Series. To this day, ?The Mick? remains the greatest switch-hitter in baseball history; however, behind his country charm and good looks there was his wayward lifestyle that harmed his marriage, his relationship with his four sons and ultimately his health.","popularity":0.8743,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":6751,"logo_path":"/giPzzhPdiNloiuwo7qLagRn5uGH.png","name":"HBO Sports","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Definitive Story of Mickey Mantle","title":"Mantle","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":160042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Costas","original_name":"Bob Costas","popularity":0.5564,"profile_path":"/icnJnhC0voFGH9QaIiWQf5MhL5N.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4af09251416c750f309f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Crystal","original_name":"Billy Crystal","popularity":1.2294,"profile_path":"/jfcCceTnP7rrHz1pSjCxiqRosw3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4af09251416c750f30a3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1222706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Skip Bayless","original_name":"Skip Bayless","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":"/jKVhdkLnqmMtKAeKbdlcyCiyTBc.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4af09251416c750f30ad","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1218884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mickey Mantle","original_name":"Mickey Mantle","popularity":0.0967,"profile_path":"/aw9VUMUS6Wjv3yIJ7Zw8s7D4zVZ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe4af09251416c750f30b7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1214305,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yogi Berra","original_name":"Yogi Berra","popularity":0.1431,"profile_path":"/VtDjjoWuFLDknLhCDptnQ4OqRY.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4af09251416c750f30bb","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112028,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"George Roy","original_name":"George Roy","popularity":0.0887,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4af09251416c750f30a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1238342,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Steven Stern","original_name":"Steven Stern","popularity":0.06,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4af09251416c750f30b3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0470857","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":1480,"name":"baseball"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
