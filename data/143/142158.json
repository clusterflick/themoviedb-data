Gabino eventually tracks his father down and spends time with him in his rundown apartment, trying to figure out if there is any possibility for the two of them to ever truly communicate. Though Greatest Hits continues Pereda's exploration of his perennial themes of absence, masculinity and the difficulty of maintaining a family, it opens up a whole new set of aesthetic questions through a bold formal gambit: halfway through, the entire narrative reboots and starts from scratch with another actor playing one of the key characters, leading to different iterations of events already witnessed.","popularity":0.2592,"poster_path":"/syW6D3G5HtnMjzycFn5SjQFqai4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11214,"logo_path":"/5sra0GxCyKDxaV8ne84Fe5mlNfK.png","name":"Interior13 Cine","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2012-08-02","revenue":2333,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Greatest Hits","video":false,"vote_average":5.571,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1018056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabino Rodríguez","original_name":"Gabino Rodríguez","popularity":0.2849,"profile_path":"/v6KGU3yxp0vjgpCGhmnA78IFp9.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Gabino","credit_id":"52fe4ad19251416c750ef2ff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1043788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teresa Sánchez","original_name":"Teresa Sánchez","popularity":0.0757,"profile_path":"/iLzgyVP822PHZCOtNFROi9YSHTJ.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Tere","credit_id":"52fe4ad19251416c750ef303","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1153491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Rodríguez López","original_name":"José Rodríguez López","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Emilio","credit_id":"52fe4ad19251416c750ef307","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1043872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luisa Pardo","original_name":"Luisa Pardo","popularity":0.0628,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Luisa","credit_id":"52fe4ad19251416c750ef30b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1021436,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolás Pereda","original_name":"Nicolás Pereda","popularity":0.0996,"profile_path":"/aW94VQtSFnFjeEoJigOiZNQ2zRs.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ad19251416c750ef2ef","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1021436,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolás Pereda","original_name":"Nicolás Pereda","popularity":0.0996,"profile_path":"/aW94VQtSFnFjeEoJigOiZNQ2zRs.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ad19251416c750ef2dd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1153488,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pedro Gómez Millán","original_name":"Pedro Gómez Millán","popularity":0.0737,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ad19251416c750ef2e9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1153490,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sandra Gómez","original_name":"Sandra Gómez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ad19251416c750ef2fb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1153489,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maximiliano Cruz","original_name":"Maximiliano Cruz","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ad19251416c750ef2f5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1021436,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolás Pereda","original_name":"Nicolás Pereda","popularity":0.0996,"profile_path":"/aW94VQtSFnFjeEoJigOiZNQ2zRs.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ad19251416c750ef2d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1043786,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alejandro Coronado","original_name":"Alejandro Coronado","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ad19251416c750ef2e3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2309220","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k3SRrePDBKLQI1ShkncKynjwHFi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/syW6D3G5HtnMjzycFn5SjQFqai4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Los mejores temas (Greatest Hits) de Nicolás Pereda -
