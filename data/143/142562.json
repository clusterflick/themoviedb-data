Apart from receiving corporal punishment and verbal abuse, he was often locked up inside the wardrobe. The dark childhood turned Lo into a weirdo frequently tormented by the pain of childhood memories as well as hallucination of his dead father. Lo betrayed his father's artistic career and chose to become a magician and performer of extremities instead, to prove his own capabilities. During one of his death-defying show, Lo was seriously wounded by shocks of his childhood nightmares. Not knowing the truth behind it, his girlfriend Lei thought he was stretching his physical strength too far. She therefore took him to a quiet retreat in the suburb to recuperate. On a windy moonless night, the five of them went through a terrifying catastrophe.","popularity":0.451,"poster_path":"/eEjqKsVIscpbLFq7DCVDSMaiI0B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2007-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Closet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"衣櫃驚魂","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Closet","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"Yee chung","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"The Closet HK","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Ng Chun-Yu","original_name":"吳鎮宇","popularity":1.6531,"profile_path":"/k3FyXnmk1buLU3iKMlUNbKrKfwM.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Lo Fei","credit_id":"5a5d68d992514119db002750","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1960938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yang Chih-fei","original_name":"Yang Chih-fei","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Lei Hiu-king","credit_id":"5a5d692c92514119d80025cf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72732,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Cheung","original_name":"張兆輝","popularity":1.0366,"profile_path":"/jTrBt3y43LsO8XYsQnWg8bdwsP2.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ngok Fung","credit_id":"5a5d6a0bc3a3686a5300258e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":93990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michelle Ye Xuan","original_name":"葉璇","popularity":0.7184,"profile_path":"/v9P0nBwPAx3sdd5SMNSoJWCLSDU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mang Ping","credit_id":"5c3250a092514122ac75db55","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65999,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dick Cho","original_name":"曹建南","popularity":0.1141,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e406f184591c0045c4aa54","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6097256","wikidata_id":"Q7723474","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"cn","file_path":"/eEjqKsVIscpbLFq7DCVDSMaiI0B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"","release_date":"2007-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
