Lawson, a criminologist, and mistakenly believes that he has robbed a fellow safecracker. Out of \"professional courtesy\" he informs Lawson of what he has done. Instead of calling the police, Lawson--who believes in the philosophy of \"honor among thieves\"--makes a deal with Charlie: to show Charlie that it's actually more profitable to be a legitimate businessman then a crook, he'll give Charlie some money if Charlie will use it to establish a legitimate business in the small town of Plumfield, and at the end of a year they will divide up whatever profits Charlie is able to make honestly. Charlie agrees, but soon discovers that things aren't going to be quite as easy as he thought.","popularity":0.2744,"poster_path":"/ejtHEL055kqPQjAVNGbfuZMeFJk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31789,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goldwyn Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1921-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beating the Game","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":166297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Moore","original_name":"Tom Moore","popularity":0.1111,"profile_path":"/kFvjLdK2Tcw7cUbWcLo5vQeS0Bd.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"'Fancy Charlie'","credit_id":"62558cac32cc2b00672b9f26","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3320744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hazel Daly","original_name":"Hazel Daly","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":"/biW8QcmhrAk5NmHHnNqRtpjm1iZ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Nellie Brown","credit_id":"62558cbbc56d2d139cc54056","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"DeWitt Jennings","original_name":"DeWitt Jennings","popularity":0.0497,"profile_path":"/xW7FxW2kwQqaIZpNcfACbFeFbBp.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"G.B.
