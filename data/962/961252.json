His harrowing journey is made worse, by the constant flippancy of his mysterious companion; a macabre musician with a dark sense of humour.  The pair set off to the end of the world and to the heart of a war, that has already taken so much of the soldier's sanity.  A stark portrayal of PTSD, mental health issues and the various coping mechanisms of soldiers and civilians during wartime. Set against a low fantasy, Lovecraftian backdrop.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/86n3oo0FU7BCMqy3owmbrCa7zal.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Sober Dance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1840061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Hayter","original_name":"Edward Hayter","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/xzdsFvRkJ9vatIwACKNMdui0t1B.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Crim Snar","credit_id":"6253dbf82dffd800a090b2f6","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/86n3oo0FU7BCMqy3owmbrCa7zal.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
