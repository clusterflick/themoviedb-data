Because he is different, Donald has no friends and other children shun him. He grows up isolated and alone. Later he keeps a low profile working as an elevator operator, wearing gloves to conceal his secret. One day Molly, the girl he secretly adores, is trapped by a huge bear in the office. Donald gets a chance to make his difference become his greatest asset, if he is brave enough to save her. The moral of the story: If you are different, don't worry about what others may think, say or do, just be yourself and your dreams may come true.","popularity":0.6277,"poster_path":"/2WSJ7ylG4PxpLsQ014nB4FQLmjk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United
