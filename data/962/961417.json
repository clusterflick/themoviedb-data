A legendary production and a transitional work for the New German Cinema director as his work became increasingly international, Wenders set out to make a film about filmmaking as funding stalled on the American production of Hammett. The State of Things deals with American and European sensibilities about cinema, and he enlisted Lachman to film and document the film being made in Los Angeles. Made for German television, completed in 1985 and unseen outside of Germany, Lachman’s portrait of Wenders at work features striking filmmaking and location photography of Los Angeles in the 1980s, and serves as a candid glimpse into European encounters with American culture at the time.","popularity":0.2327,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Report from Hollywood","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Report from Hollywood: The State of Things","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2303,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wim Wenders","original_name":"Wim Wenders","popularity":1.0062,"profile_path":"/AbqrYglSgaMfetQAeqdHaqiPSof.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"625481262f1be0722df25fae","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samuel Fuller","original_name":"Samuel Fuller","popularity":0.2816,"profile_path":"/yC1rWSkV8crevItmlRz056GOTMf.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6254812fab684906131b325e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allen Garfield","original_name":"Allen Garfield","popularity":0.5104,"profile_path":"/v4S64Kcmgg7THvrFElzAeJiscy6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62548136d400f3006625a3c3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Bauchau","original_name":"Patrick Bauchau","popularity":0.7567,"profile_path":"/kdrFAJJFdfQaYUETTHQw77gim9O.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6254813e8e2e0014354223e6","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6345,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Edward Lachman","original_name":"Edward Lachman","popularity":0.2185,"profile_path":"/hLX1z5v2o9q1pFLB4NuyLtd9dGM.jpg","credit_id":"6254814bfcb8cc00673e1753","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0289420","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Placeholder for exact date.
