The latter function as a transmedial bibliography to their collaborative artistic research practice. Exploring their multi-faceted relationship while digressing about academic essays, blockbuster horror movies, and arthouse videos, the filmmakers-turned-protagonists point their cameras on their immediate surroundings and on each other for the purpose of fabulating stories about convivial queer futures. All this unravels in a stream of loose associations and at a languid pace of a scorching hot summer, scored by the ongoing hum of always-present cicadas.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"It is a non-chronological and fragmented record of a research investigation that authors initiated while working towards curating a Vienna-based exhibition “The Poiesis of Composting,” as well as their own artistic performative pieces.","title":"I Am and Tell Me What","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2429279,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rafal Morusiewicz","original_name":"Rafal Morusiewicz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62542e3ffd63006b21ab0fb3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
