We start with spectacular footage along the Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad as freight trains work their way through the Rocky Mountains, before moving on to Sand Patch to see the relentless steam of westbound freight trains attacking the steep grade. The railroad town of Altoona in Pennsylvania sees plenty of action too, as trains prepare for the stiff climb to Horseshoe Curve, and on through the mountains to Cresson. There is coal traffic near Iaeger in West Virginia, as well as action at the train hot spot of Cajon Pass in Southern California with regular BNSF and Union Pacific trains. Of course, no program on the American railroads would be complete without a ride on the stunning Royal Gorge Route Railroad in Colorado.","popularity":0.1425,"poster_path":"/e6J51RTjLhzSAIM8T1k7mlyE3QL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98587,"logo_path":null,"name":"Go Entertainment Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"From spectacular frieght action to stunning narrow gauge lines, discover the sublime beauty of America's railroads.","title":"The Best of American Railroads","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e6J51RTjLhzSAIM8T1k7mlyE3QL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18044,"name":"railroad"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
