In this portrait, Gehry explores his work of the 1990's including The Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao and the Frederick R. Weisman Museum in Minneapolis, as well as his first European commission, the EMR Communication and Technology Center in Bad Oeynhausen, Germany. Seeing himself as an artist first, Gehry discusses his early relationships in the art world and how sculpture, painting and small scale work has influenced his architectural style. Like Rauschenberg, Johns, and Warhol, he has introduced \"bad taste\" into his concepts, while keeping himself outside of the contemporary dialogue between modernism and post-modernism. He has translated the vocabulary of contemporary art into an architectural language of his own, disobeying the rules of his profession and questioning its historic conventions.","popularity":0.1073,"poster_path":"/9molRi7zmb0wfqyZBRk2pEJt8Ts.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"Frank Gehry: An Architecture of Joy\" illustrates the unique intertwining of art and architecture throughout Gehry's spectacularly eclectic career.","title":"Frank Gehry: An Architecture of Joy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3503054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Ghery","original_name":"Frank Ghery","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"himself","credit_id":"6254968b6ee3d70ac16aee78","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2323074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellsworth Kelly","original_name":"Ellsworth Kelly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"himself","credit_id":"6254969567e0f739c1a2db98","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1264965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Blackwood","original_name":"Michael Blackwood","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":"/8R0NnxYVOuWqX5PvIvA0vmmLqh5.jpg","credit_id":"625496762f1be038ab749d38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1836798","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1481,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9molRi7zmb0wfqyZBRk2pEJt8Ts.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2000-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
