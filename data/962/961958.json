One day away by ferry, the only Tongan Psychiatrist Dr Mapa Puloka has established a public psychiatry well known across the region. Although the two healers have never met in person, this film creates a dialogue between them on the nature of mental illness and spiritual affliction - and the shared obstacles they face in providing their services to the people in need. Their commitment and transformative communication offers challenges and opportunities to help address the growing global mental health crisis.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/nGCaAnCMU7r73nwUE5mW3H5qtE2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tonga","iso_639_1":"to","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Healer and the Psychiatrist","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3504494,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Poltorak","original_name":"Mike Poltorak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62563deb9a8a8a0213ef3ab4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nGCaAnCMU7r73nwUE5mW3H5qtE2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
