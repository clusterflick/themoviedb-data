A verbal sparring match with a sexy woman in a Manhattan bar one evening enables him to snap his cartoonist's writer's block, leading him to dash home after the encounter, and set down in cartoon form everything that just happened between him and the girl (whose name is \"Daphne\"). The cartoon strip (later named \"City News\") becomes a local hit, boosting his newspaper's sales. Now, with the newspaper finally a success, Domino finds himself in a conundrum: does he love Daphne genuinely for who she is, or only because she is the muse who has enabled him to become a success?","popularity":0.113,"poster_path":"/lUtcBFmzRKgMuFWsvXJqD9vKPWk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"City News","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3501824,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elliot Crown","original_name":"Elliot Crown","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Tom Domino","credit_id":"62535f5555937b027e38311e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":269159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nancy Cohen","original_name":"Nancy Cohen","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Daphne","credit_id":"62535fb5447f9c485e19e228","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":81836,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Richard Schlesinger","original_name":"Richard Schlesinger","popularity":0.0481,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Lou","credit_id":"62535fdbab68491238cce40c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3501825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Trivier","original_name":"Thomas Trivier","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Frenchy","credit_id":"62535fe9ca4f670050bf05bb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3501826,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valerie Felitto","original_name":"Valerie Felitto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"DeeDee","credit_id":"62535ff26ee3d7009e4f53d1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3501828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Mangis","original_name":"Tony Mangis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Tony","credit_id":"62535ffc4df2910066396861","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3501829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gail Gibney","original_name":"Gail Gibney","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Gail","credit_id":"62536005a6c10457aeb31c2e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2291429,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Fishelson","original_name":"David Fishelson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Punch","credit_id":"62536020aad9c2032072c004","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3501830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoe Zinman","original_name":"Zoe Zinman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Judy","credit_id":"6253602e357c0000a6aab2f3","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2291429,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Fishelson","original_name":"David Fishelson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625360482f1be0522ae32f3b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3501830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoe Zinman","original_name":"Zoe Zinman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62536057d8e2250864ea30bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2291429,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Fishelson","original_name":"David Fishelson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6253606341465c4bd8155a55","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3501831,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Zoe Zinman","original_name":"Zoe Zinman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62536090aad9c200523e38e5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0085343","wikidata_id":"Q15039840","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lUtcBFmzRKgMuFWsvXJqD9vKPWk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1984-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
