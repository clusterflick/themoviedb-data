Uncompromising, often brutal group therapy sessions are designed to shake loose the excuses a victim makes for himself. The people and situations shown are authentic; only one actor was employed. The results obtained at Daytop are regarded by some psychiatrists as a breakthrough.","popularity":0.442,"poster_path":"/xz0qP31pNCQAGdmQE93bKQCuEax.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1967-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Circle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Francks","original_name":"Don Francks","popularity":0.2925,"profile_path":"/q1bvy838NZCLDxWLpwhJYC5FsDA.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Don","credit_id":"6254a826d400f30050525c26","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52952,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Kemeny","original_name":"John Kemeny","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6254a7fb389da1009a47ef9d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":184475,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mort Ransen","original_name":"Mort Ransen","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6254a7e0ab684906131bf755","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1448132,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michael McKennirey","original_name":"Michael McKennirey","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6254a80e357c00004f8d57b1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":184475,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mort Ransen","original_name":"Mort Ransen","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c02823a6e551119a3596b8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1625447,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gilles Gascon","original_name":"Gilles Gascon","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c0283f14a4396cafc8d6f0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0225400","wikidata_id":"Q123288208","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xz0qP31pNCQAGdmQE93bKQCuEax.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":567,"name":"alcohol"},{"id":6357,"name":"tobacco"},{"id":10649,"name":"drug rehabilitation"},{"id":14964,"name":"drugs"},{"id":185974,"name":"substance abuse"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1967-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
