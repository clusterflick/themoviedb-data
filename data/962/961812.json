Miguel left Mexico at a young age, giving up his passion for music and singing. Now he is alone, without family, friends or money. Dalia, the college student, and neighbor, lends more than a sympathetic ear to his anecdotes and reflections; she encourages him to reconnect with friends and family as he faces death.","popularity":0.0522,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bye Bye Chicago","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3504228,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Enrique Gaona Jr","original_name":"Enrique Gaona Jr","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6255dbe8aaec710e677f1572","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2753393,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roma Vaquero Diaz","original_name":"Roma Vaquero Diaz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6255dbd62dda8900505bc72e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"Chicago Latino Film Festival","release_date":"2022-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
