The occupation of shaman is female dominated and holds a dual reputation in contemporary Korean society. In one respect, shamans are considered lewd women who promote superstition; in another, they are seen as keeping alive the religious ideals of the past. The film follows one woman's trials from when she felt destined to be a shaman through her two-day initiation ceremony. The emotional impact of the ceremony, which is apparent throughout, reaches a climax during the ritual of the 'knife riding general' in which the initiate stands barefoot on knife blades in order to receive the spirits and speak in their voices.","popularity":0.0662,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Initiation \"Kut\" for a Korean Shaman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3503280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurel Kendall","original_name":"Laurel Kendall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6254e4758d2f8d0067abc095","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3503281,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diana Lee","original_name":"Diana Lee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6254e4939f5dfb009a85b2e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
