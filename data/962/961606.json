The work presents a critical and creative performance of the habitual, ritualized movements of video games. Beginning with various sets of stock animations for games (shooting, swinging a sword, punching, etc.), T-POSE then situates these movements in a continuously-developing, infinitely variable, ritualistic dance. The procedural, contingent nature of the dance allows for the creative ‘drift’ between the written score (the tropes and animations) and the ritualized performance which differs each time.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/j56xM1yBZ6QxI3l5UhZuMCqNf7t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"T-POSE: To Dance with One's Hands","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3503470,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Sych","original_name":"Steven Sych","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6255471166ae4d0e832c1198","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j56xM1yBZ6QxI3l5UhZuMCqNf7t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Burnt Video Art and Experimental Film Festival","release_date":"2022-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"MACA, Alicante Museum of Contemporary Art","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
