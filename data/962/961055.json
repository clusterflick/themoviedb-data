And a light air, as if they were stitched together with humming. The film, which was made from images that sprang up rather than being worked out, asks the viewer to be sensitised rather than understood. The happiness and unconcernedness given by the many songs and smiles of the characters may be one of the origins of \"making films because you love them\".","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":"/4IBAEd23PszriusikJO8Sc3y8EH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Would you like to join our dance circle?","title":"Paris Comes When The Flowers Bloom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3501541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masako Sakamoto","original_name":"Masako Sakamoto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"62532dc76ee3d7006690a42c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3501533,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tsumura Akiko","original_name":"Tsumura Akiko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"62532dd055937b02c0cca6db","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3066494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kyoko Watanabe","original_name":"Kyoko Watanabe","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"62532ddba0b6b506123d29c6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3501543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masamitsu Sugamata","original_name":"Masamitsu Sugamata","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"62532de36ee3d7009e4e7db7","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3501532,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yoichi Suzuki","original_name":"Yoichi Suzuki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62532d5e6ee3d70050c66d0c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3501534,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Miura Maika","original_name":"Miura Maika","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62532d8e447f9c502a4717fc","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3501534,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Miura Maika","original_name":"Miura Maika","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62532d7d77b1fb0066a6f792","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3501533,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tsumura Akiko","original_name":"Tsumura Akiko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62532d516ee3d7006690a22c","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3501539,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Yamamori Kayoko","original_name":"Yamamori Kayoko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62532db99d6e334abddeb79c","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3501532,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yoichi Suzuki","original_name":"Yoichi Suzuki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62532d644df2910066386bd2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3501534,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Miura Maika","original_name":"Miura Maika","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62532d82b7a15400656a8365","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3501536,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Matsuura Momoko","original_name":"Matsuura Momoko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62532dadb7a1540050bca1dd","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3501532,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yoichi Suzuki","original_name":"Yoichi Suzuki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62532d6aaad9c200523d2afa","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3501532,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yoichi Suzuki","original_name":"Yoichi Suzuki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62532d2077b1fb0066a6f5b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3501535,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Suzuki Sewing","original_name":"Suzuki Sewing","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62532d9bd8e2250864e91667","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4IBAEd23PszriusikJO8Sc3y8EH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
