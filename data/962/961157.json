Taken by night, Baranowsky filmed the full-moon holding the camera as steady as possible, manipulating the video only by framing the moon into a limited space. Due to the movement of the boat on the waves, the moon becomes a ball-like, rhythmically moving disc. The black and white of the image as well as the lack of any spatial indicators enhance the two-dimensionality of the work. Baranowsky plays with the expectations and experiences of the spectator.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/iexkWeqFub1nKtRtcxbkH9SjmVU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mondfahrt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2241998,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heike Baranowsky","original_name":"Heike Baranowsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6253697b4df291009db3b58c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iexkWeqFub1nKtRtcxbkH9SjmVU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
