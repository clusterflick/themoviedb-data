It was an epic battle with the closest of rivals which secured automatic promotion to the Championship and the pride of beating neighbours, United, to victory. Guiding the club to an unbeaten run since he joined in March, Dave Jones took the helm to secure that all important second place finish on the final day of the season, expertly steering the team to victory over Wycombe Wanderers, sending Hillsborough into scenes of jubilation. Relive all 54 matches from this historic season and witness the emergence of a deadly striking duo; the rock solid defence that conceded just 3 goals in the final 8 games; wins over local rivals Sheffield United and Championship side West Ham United, as well the glorious 14 game unbeaten run at the business end of the campaign that secured promotion for the Owls.","popularity":0.0596,"poster_path":"/ve4iueR3jL8nN30ajE7S3DpCdwo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"We Are Going Up!","title":"Sheffield Wednesday 2011/12 Season Review","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ve4iueR3jL8nN30ajE7S3DpCdwo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
