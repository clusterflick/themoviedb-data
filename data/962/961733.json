The keys to fortune: knowing how to hide, find accomplices and take advantage of all the flaws.

How is the political staff complicit? How are we braking? Between Paris and Geneva, Washington and Luxembourg, from Société Générale to HSBC, via Mac Donald, Ikea and Google ... we will track down the circuits of tax evasion and decipher the mechanisms of
