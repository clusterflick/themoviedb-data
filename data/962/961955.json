The first ever production of La Traviata by Peter Konwitschny of Graz Opera is a highly-focused, intelligent reading of the music that was widely acclaimed by audiences. With a reduced stage set and daring cuts in the score, the production concentrates on the tragic story of the courtesan Violetta. Soprano Marlis Petersen (2010 „Singer of the Year“ in Germany) is superb in the title role.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/7VI5oIDk6Sxq7LTzMCoHzRGoMKK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99460,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oper Graz","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La traviata","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1560771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marlis Petersen","original_name":"Marlis Petersen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/juOFmeaDnu7el7F0UqtlkdNQ8ac.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Violetta Valéry","credit_id":"67ffb910de5e4dec62aebee3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5376272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristina Antonie Fehrs","original_name":"Kristina Antonie Fehrs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Flora Bervoix","credit_id":"67ffb922aacf7cfb2699f053","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5376273,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fran Lubahn","original_name":"Fran Lubahn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Annina","credit_id":"67ffb933d645e41e0999608d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5376275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giuseppe Varano","original_name":"Giuseppe Varano","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Alfredo Germont","credit_id":"67ffb94bb113ff8723d9122d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1984423,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Rutherford","original_name":"James Rutherford","popularity":0.0694,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Giorgio Germont","credit_id":"67ffb95ede5e4dec62aebf0f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1171211,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Konwitschny","original_name":"Peter Konwitschny","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/mxi1QKwJJKzixCVlkq3ht1OgjPA.jpg","credit_id":"67ffb9792c85e79663992d15","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5376277,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tecwyn Evans","original_name":"Tecwyn Evans","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ffb991aacf7cfb2699f077","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15130,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giuseppe Verdi","original_name":"Giuseppe Verdi","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":"/3W2HAqexkcpK6mWG3vseRlhD1ep.jpg","credit_id":"67ffb9a2aacf7cfb2699f07b","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140807,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Francesco Maria Piave","original_name":"Francesco Maria Piave","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ffb9b22c85e79663992d3d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2173,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7VI5oIDk6Sxq7LTzMCoHzRGoMKK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1449}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
