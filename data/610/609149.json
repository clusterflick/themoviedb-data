When Cleo's husband enters, a fight ensues, and Trent kills his rival in the struggle. Jack Stanley arrives on the scene to help but is accused of the murder by Cleo and is sent off to prison. The opportunistic Trent marries Jack's rich fianc√©e Helen Forde, who believes that her former lover is guilty of unfaithfulness. Jealous of the arrangement, Cleo eventually tells Helen the truth about the killing, causing Betty, Helen's daughter, to cry over her mother's unhappiness. Moved by the girl's tears, Cleo joins forces with Helen against Trent, and the two women go West where Jack, escaped from prison, works as a cowboy.","popularity":0.1169,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Woman Who Lied","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":28972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Fuller","original_name":"Mary Fuller","popularity":0.0939,"profile_path":"/7XIkKyvcJ8aEmhZNctVOjDCudMH.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Cleo Martell","credit_id":"5fe4d197e18b97003f88fd15","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1794300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edna Hunter","original_name":"Edna Hunter","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/172wyIqUgz0oKWUKX1vwdsegLyW.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Helen Forde","credit_id":"5fe4d1a8c7176d003f739815","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Ogle","original_name":"Charles Ogle","popularity":0.2381,"profile_path":"/hmSOnMuub9xJ606MsSZEqJg4fXG.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Sheriff Cassidy","credit_id":"5fe4d1af1d6c5f0044dc120d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931793,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Panzer","original_name":"Paul Panzer","popularity":0.1899,"profile_path":"/6NhO8FSFg6azBGaga5IaSNaUNEs.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Gordon Trent","credit_id":"5fe4d1b470309f003e81ab3c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milton Sills","original_name":"Milton Sills","popularity":0.082,"profile_path":"/eJTx8Tzq7wx9PwnuHm1cb27KSDx.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Jack Stanley","credit_id":"5fe4d1b91d6c5f0044dc12f9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2908783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Heidloff","original_name":"William Heidloff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Harry Parker","credit_id":"5fe4d19d1d6c5f0044dc11fb","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1091587,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucius Henderson","original_name":"Lucius Henderson","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/jqX1Bxdkhm4gFWKPeEj9pyETHGk.jpg","credit_id":"5d23bc4aa698cf24b9a6e524","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148801,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Olga Printzlau","original_name":"Olga Printzlau","popularity":0.0548,"profile_path":"/3TRhkJBAUKtoSLrvVMaUq3ieVUo.jpg","credit_id":"5fe4d19013654500405b02f6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0006305","wikidata_id":"Q21287419","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1915-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
