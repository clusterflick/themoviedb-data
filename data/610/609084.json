After Grant breaks up a fight in a bar between drunken Dave Wilson and an old man reprimanding him, Dave is told by his mother to apologize to Grant. He meets Benson, who witnessed the fight, outside Grant's apartment and tells him his purpose, but during Dave's conversation with Grant, Grant suddenly drops dead.
