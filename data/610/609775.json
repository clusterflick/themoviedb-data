Working with a media production team and wide range of collaborators—including color experts, facial roboticists, hair stylists, voice actors, fight choreographers and VFX engineers—Kato directs the execution of his story about a non-sighted fighter and a telepath searching for a mysterious ghost in a future world. His pursuit becomes a deep interrogation of how sensory environments are perceived and rendered, offering new ways for viewers to think through their own assumptions about cinema and imagination. -JAPAN CUTS: Festival of New Japanese Film","popularity":0.0474,"poster_path":"/ytMZgBo9m3VJxaV2Z20vj8RLYHc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":144,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"NIGHT CRUISING","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2316288,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Makoto Sasaki","original_name":"Makoto Sasaki","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":"/yRUJykvq699mdU8oE9hPjEjSZ5K.jpg","credit_id":"5f5b8e38da10f00036910aba","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2316288,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Makoto Sasaki","original_name":"Makoto Sasaki","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":"/yRUJykvq699mdU8oE9hPjEjSZ5K.jpg","credit_id":"5f5b8e42629b2c0035c37942","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8521134","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ytMZgBo9m3VJxaV2Z20vj8RLYHc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Japanese\", \"english_name\"=>\"Japanese\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"ja\", \"native_name\"=>\"Japanese\"}","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"NIGHT CRUISING trailer SUBBED","key":"cr0hekeRZak","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-06-19T08:47:03.000Z","id":"62cd15c1e8d0280052f2120d"}]}}}
