She and her grandmother accidentally find themselves at the circumcision of a little child, and there someone tells her about a tradition quite strange to the outsiders: if a woman who cannot get pregnant eats the foreskin of a baby, life will take a turn for the better.  Israeli director Shirley Sasson-Ezer shows intergenerational relationships that are full of love and are devoid of aggression and yet are still complicated by the insurmountable obstacles of differences in worldviews.","popularity":0.1742,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2019-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Offspring","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1134920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rotem Zissman-Cohen","original_name":"רותם זיסמן-כהן","popularity":0.1131,"profile_path":"/nDXEZ8iXFZiKcQtYiITLVQoxSYO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ilana","credit_id":"5d09ded0c3a368718620a188","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":131925,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dover Koshashvili","original_name":"Dover Koshashvili","popularity":0.248,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mohel","credit_id":"5d09dedac3a3687c752083de","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2341994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hefsigul Usherova-Shmuelova","original_name":"Hefsigul Usherova-Shmuelova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Grandmother","credit_id":"5d09dee5925141412eb8af8b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2341995,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shirly Sasson-Ezer","original_name":"Shirly Sasson-Ezer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d09df04925141412eb8af99","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2341996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dana Keidar-Levin","original_name":"Dana Keidar-Levin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d09df0cc3a3685fdf2048e0","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2341996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dana Keidar-Levin","original_name":"Dana Keidar-Levin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d09def9c3a3681ddc1e6128","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2341995,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shirly Sasson-Ezer","original_name":"Shirly Sasson-Ezer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d09deeec3a368474a1e5a82","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9670832","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Clujshorts International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2019-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow Jewish Film Festival","release_date":"2019-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
