An almost tangible cinematic fabric that weaves a tale of an abandoned place where the mist clings to the steel-blue surface of the sea and where the occasional human visitor is sometimes welcome.","popularity":0.2136,"poster_path":"/krg0yXGvDcUo2sW7j8GMsHmJqT2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"2020-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Autumn","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1512665,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Heikki Kossi","original_name":"Heikki Kossi","popularity":0.1537,"profile_path":"/6VipnMFz9whg3WKRGld7KJDGTlo.jpg","credit_id":"64402e7c15dea0044ff0a03c","department":"Sound","job":"Foley Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1385765,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yrsa Roca Fannberg","original_name":"Yrsa Roca Fannberg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d0585d992514163d1be4358","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11119412","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/krg0yXGvDcUo2sW7j8GMsHmJqT2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1358}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Glasgow Film Festival","release_date":"2020-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
