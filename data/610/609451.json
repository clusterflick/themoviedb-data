A few days later, they are contacted by the people they rescued, who want to meet the strangers who helped them that night. The man and the woman meet again. Is the passion they feel real? Or is it just the romantic illusion they invented to compensate for the trauma they experienced together? From hospital rooms to cafe encounters, from individual destinies to love stories, from suffering to resilience, from anger to fraternity, the film portrays the days following the attacks and each person's journey to find their way back to life.","popularity":0.335,"poster_path":"/8gR6smj4utWeCSKSjpr21U2qz2x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ce soir-là et les jours d'après","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":19161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandrine Bonnaire","original_name":"Sandrine Bonnaire","popularity":0.4922,"profile_path":"/iTHkJuVdFcAuZZtBH2frKTeujKG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Irène","credit_id":"5d079f9192514104c4bd9e58","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Abkarian","original_name":"Simon Abkarian","popularity":0.2123,"profile_path":"/rpw1AujIl0vJD6cyMDo2ykJ8rZA.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Karan","credit_id":"5d079fa50e0a261fbbda3e85","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":500341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naidra Ayadi","original_name":"Naidra Ayadi","popularity":0.1866,"profile_path":"/oNUYzgil3ZrduOELBJvC79YjXzb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Samira","credit_id":"5d079fb69251416975b83c00","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":64767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juliette Lamboley","original_name":"Juliette Lamboley","popularity":0.2627,"profile_path":"/5wvaR6SSNBviX0VgUBhXRJ39RfO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Céline","credit_id":"5d079fd10e0a2601efc9b522","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1863475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thor Schenker","original_name":"Thor Schenker","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":"/eH1GOOcAQhipKkF0P36IpxEFCfm.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"David","credit_id":"5d079fe3c3a368445b2f7961","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2340262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-Hélène Leyrit","original_name":"Marie-Hélène Leyrit","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"mère de Léopold","credit_id":"5d07a024c3a3680cba1ef96d","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":931095,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marion Laine","original_name":"Marion Laine","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d079f1c925141488abbcd62","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":132228,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nicolas Mercier","original_name":"Nicolas Mercier","popularity":0.1023,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d079f38c3a3680a5723e64b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17393,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pierre Milon","original_name":"Pierre Milon","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/hufdXiN3JX1yM1WGcoPkbcPm8Ic.jpg","credit_id":"67524858ab37fcd3e8851921","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1699556,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Svetlana Vaynblat","original_name":"Svetlana Vaynblat","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6752485fab37fcd3e885192a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8123660","wikidata_id":"Q65124350","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8gR6smj4utWeCSKSjpr21U2qz2x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"France 2","release_date":"2019-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
