Twenty years later, Roy comes back to live with Tim, and is appalled at his unscrupulous methods of conducting business. Then, he falls in love with Enid Winslow, the daughter of a social reformer who is running for office against Tim. Largely due to Roy's financial support, Winslow wins the election, but, holding a grudge against Tim and anyone connected to him, he refuses to let Enid marry Roy.","popularity":0.1819,"poster_path":"/vPAAPgQehBVNudI4yCbyH5ZeYbY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"},{"id":118095,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Feather Photoplays","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Powerful Human Heart Drama Depicting the Rise & Fall of a Grasping Politician","title":"The Iron Hand","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43826,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Clark","original_name":"Edward Clark","popularity":0.1205,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Jerry Simpson","credit_id":"622a2b6b726fb1006f9aaacd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hobart Bosworth","original_name":"Hobart Bosworth","popularity":0.2715,"profile_path":"/embweEOzbEdv3FgNikIgv6ZoTS1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tim Noland","credit_id":"622a2b7012c604001ce88a71","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1307855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Curtis","original_name":"Jack Curtis","popularity":0.0813,"profile_path":"/huntTbXIEl8GPyFkM3FJ6LB96wY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Connors","credit_id":"622a2b7584591c006e774456","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William V.
