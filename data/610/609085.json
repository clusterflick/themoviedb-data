When Phidias refuses to give up his work, Diogenes appears and suggests that the sculptor ask the statues themselves whom they would prefer as their owner. After coming to life, the statues abandon the sculptor for the rich man. Awakening, Raphael continues his pursuit of the beautiful Marco, a society woman who has posed for him. Marco ultimately spurns his love in favor of a wealthy viscount, however, leaving Raphael to seek happiness with the humble but loving Marie.","popularity":0.1269,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Wonderful Moral Lesson Depicting the Tortures of a Guilty Conscience TAKEN IN THE TROPICAL WEST INDIES","title":"The Marble Heart","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":921738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"King Baggot","original_name":"King Baggot","popularity":0.4096,"profile_path":"/3RH89Z7zLKJjVRyb0vz27fWn9d3.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Raphael / Phidias","credit_id":"6217cb3954f6eb0069526a7f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1687121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Fearnley","original_name":"Jane Fearnley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/aKthZqhgjz28qIDO5ODGT4vfIyA.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Marco / Asphasia","credit_id":"6217cb48d14443001beee41c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2306671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Smith","original_name":"Frank Smith","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/jtIe9dflo06xYyqGXgUUZrmrmYL.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Volage / Diogenes","credit_id":"6217cb5d3a99370042e5fadd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3300812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ned Reardon","original_name":"Ned Reardon","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Viscount / Georgias","credit_id":"6217cb6c0e597b00691d9aaa","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1794300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edna Hunter","original_name":"Edna Hunter","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/172wyIqUgz0oKWUKX1vwdsegLyW.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Marie / sculptor's servant","credit_id":"6217cb7a3d4d96004104c6a8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3442233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Weirman","original_name":"Marie Weirman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/dxi7mzIK2fsD6TmBDaA1RmiVWfm.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6217cb8fcb9f4b0042eb07f8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2726041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yona Landowska","original_name":"Yona Landowska","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/13RuEYyT9xlrsLU6JODkwgUVIei.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"6217cba1cb9f4b0042eb0834","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brinsley Shaw","original_name":"Brinsley Shaw","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":"/jbtbaIq0cMBtwkpRR18Vi9xcTpa.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6217cbaba6d931001b575fca","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1904426,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Charles Selby","original_name":"Charles Selby","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6217cb22ce5d820069248ef7","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Lessey","original_name":"George Lessey","popularity":0.0951,"profile_path":"/5OFMGdV6Ayp2QyG1me5J8yvxdXq.jpg","credit_id":"5d23d12ea698cf000ea789e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0005713","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1915-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
