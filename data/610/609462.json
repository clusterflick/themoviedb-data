During a video workshop, the youngsters decided to present aspects of their villages and the process of gathering and selling the pequi fruit to the outside world. Incited by the possibility of filming and starring in their own film, they looked for the elders in the villages in attempt to find myths about the pequi. The making of this film was a process between indigenous and non-indigenous videomakers: from the main concept and filming to the editing and post-production. All images were recorded by the Manoki videomakers.","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vende-se Pequi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2340321,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Léo Fuser","original_name":"Léo Fuser","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d07b0310e0a267f57caccdb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2340317,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André Lopes","original_name":"André Lopes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d07affe0e0a26511fcd6325","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2340318,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"João Paulo Kayoli","original_name":"João Paulo Kayoli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d07b0269251416975b85473","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2340320,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Atailson Jolasi","original_name":"Atailson Jolasi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d07b0199251411cd0b95216","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2340318,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"João Paulo Kayoli","original_name":"João Paulo Kayoli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d07b00a0e0a261fbbda5e36","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1551,"name":"indigenous"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
