The photographs were instantly recognized as a singular achievement: the black and white images embodied not the infirmities of old age, but the timeless strength, dignity, even majesty. In 2007 Margaret Lunt left her long-time home in Niagara Falls, Ontario and moved to Montreal to live with her son. It was shortly afterwards, that filmmaker Donald Winkler embarked on a project that would explore what lay behind that series of photographs, uncovering in the process a poignant family history, a woman's determination to be her own person, how readily she threw off her own deepest cultural conditioning when she discovered both her sons were gay and a most unique and inspiring relationship between mother and son. The result...is Margaret & Evergon.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":"/hLnJutAdrxutWnC1ubazfokBsdm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Margaret & Evergon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1759340,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donald Winkler","original_name":"Donald Winkler","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d06e521c3a36877db22690b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1959469","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hLnJutAdrxutWnC1ubazfokBsdm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
