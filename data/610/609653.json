He takes part in the Ukrainian Maidan, takes the Trans-Siberian Express across Russia, sails down the Kolyma river, comes across nomadic reindeer herdsmen, soldiers, mystics, artists and scholars. He tries to comprehend the present situation of two feuding countries of the former Soviet empire. The film's framework forms the director's conversation with a Prague optician, Jakub Thuri, shot during the director's check-up. Using travel materials on top, it allows a peep inside a traveller's consciousness wandering in recollections and trails of sensory perceptions from expeditions to far-away lands and finding a way how to grasp them, put them in order and pass them on.","popularity":0.1402,"poster_path":"/ajsizOyqoLMDouvYJqiw5rIqhMZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56831,"logo_path":"/cPN97t4u6hG6bS76DpsKX7UFxyA.png","name":"Background Films","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2017-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Slepý Gulliver","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Blind Gulliver","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1629727,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Ryšavý","original_name":"Martin Ryšavý","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d08c7f29251411dbab8d488","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1162347,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anna Ryndová","original_name":"Anna Ryndová","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d08c82e92514163bab8eb4e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1497982,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vít Janeček","original_name":"Vít Janeček","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d08c814c3a3687c751e95f3","department":"Crew","job":"Dramaturgy"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1629727,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Ryšavý","original_name":"Martin Ryšavý","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d08c8000e0a2628abca3e1f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1629727,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Ryšavý","original_name":"Martin Ryšavý","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d08c80bc3a3685fdf1e797a","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1629727,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Ryšavý","original_name":"Martin Ryšavý","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d08c81d9251411dbab8d5de","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7582146","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hTFviSF5Y5Xvs3v3W4VQAp6n8po.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1366}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":"cs","file_path":"/ajsizOyqoLMDouvYJqiw5rIqhMZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":907}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9935,"name":"travel"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ČT2","release_date":"2019-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
