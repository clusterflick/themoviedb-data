But life here is not easy. No one knows that better than Issa Simai, who spends his days, spear in hand, in the warm Indian Ocean trying to catch enough octopus or lobster to make a living. Issa is also a member of The Leopards, Zanzibar's most successful soccer team. This season, they have won their way to a playoff on the mainland, Tanzania, in Dar es Salaam. But before the Leopards even reach the field, they face a daunting obstacle: paying for the trip. Will the Leopards make enough to hire a boat to the mainland? And even more challenging, will they ace the playoff and return home to the cheers of their Zanzibar fans?","popularity":0.8242,"poster_path":"/oFqc1bSOO0dNNrkgMIndj3BkNLR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Africa: The Leopards of Zanzibar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4040691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Issa Simai","original_name":"Issa Simai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64510ef1d7107e012d01097f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Morton","original_name":"Joe Morton","popularity":1.0389,"profile_path":"/w7rGWWSGKWWukojLbZOQJ5yh9jv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"64510f23af85de00e7240366","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1718382,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dave Thrasher","original_name":"Dave Thrasher","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64510efee16e5a0106c36174","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/oFqc1bSOO0dNNrkgMIndj3BkNLR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ka667eQWyAqT7R4wXI7tQtmaBzj.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2001-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
