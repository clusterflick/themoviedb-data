Sara's goal is to shame Anna, who does not have a lot of romance. They go out in a box. In the middle of the night, Sara, exhausted, decides to go back while Anna stays. At dawn, Anna wakes up near a suburban station. She is drugged, raped. Anna is confronted by a skeptical policeman. Vexed, she does not complain.
