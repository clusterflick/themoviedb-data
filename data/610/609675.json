Mysterious events unfold and reveal how Martha, a Polish holocaust survivor, managed to lead a double life in Australia.

Eve’s investigation leads her to the Sobieski castle in the Ukraine, the site of a massacre where her grandmother died, and the Eichmann trial as she explores her parents’ holocaust survival and her father’s heroic escape from a concentration camp.  When a ‘doppelgänger’ contacts Eve, her life is forever altered, as she uncovers lies, tracks down her mother’s young lover and reveals the family secret that led her to rewrite her entire life.","popularity":0.1531,"poster_path":"/hRC0QRCV6wVUazOijteFH9EpMqT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Man on the Bus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2341293,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eve Ash","original_name":"Eve Ash","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d08f07d92514150c1b917c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10064828","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.66,"height":1068,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hRC0QRCV6wVUazOijteFH9EpMqT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":705},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1481,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2wu0w4ez5IHWLIgSNjEeymyc5Mk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1739,"name":"holocaust (shoah)"},{"id":3371,"name":"family history"},{"id":274920,"name":"jewish"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
