The prosecution needs to prove the guilt of the 94-year-old Reinhold Hanning who worked as an SS guard at the Auschwitz concentration camp and says that he had not a clue about what was happening within its walls. Then the 3D model of the Auschwitz as it used to be is created, and the jurors are given VR-helmets so that they can step into the Unterscharführer’s shoes and make a moral choice that he had once faced. Then they will make their own decision in real life by finding him guilty or not guilty in being involved in a hundred and fifty thousands of murders.","popularity":0.0596,"poster_path":"/qe1kulFpKhJUGd9LLp0LmQGpCzX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nazi VR","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1595092,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Freid","original_name":"David Freid","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d09c604925141412eb88ae2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1595092,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Freid","original_name":"David Freid","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d09c6150e0a265ca3cc0ee3","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2341945,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mor Albalak","original_name":"Mor Albalak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d09c61e925141412bb88364","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1595092,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Freid","original_name":"David Freid","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d09c6280e0a2678fcca08f0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2341946,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Randall Maxwell","original_name":"Randall Maxwell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d09c633c3a368469e1e2ffc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7741046","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.647,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qe1kulFpKhJUGd9LLp0LmQGpCzX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":647}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow Jewish Film Festival","release_date":"2019-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cinequest","release_date":"2019-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
