Each has it's own texture and sees the domestic environment in it's own particular way, one scan at a time. The 'narrator' is taken from the sound of an instructional software disk, which accompanied one of the scanners. This piece is deals with the deliberate misuse/re-purposing of commercial image producing machines and celebrates a slow, individual, low end, approach to the motion picture making process.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ggAYgmnL70Gfl9HxDoiEliGk0uF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Close The Lid Gently","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1596384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ariana Gerstein","original_name":"Ariana Gerstein","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d05dcbb0e0a260b0ad04125","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2274640","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ggAYgmnL70Gfl9HxDoiEliGk0uF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1063}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
