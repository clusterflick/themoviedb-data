For Tonino, Gennaro, Giacinto and Genny there is no difference. They are Le Coccinelle (the Ladybugs), who sing modern Neapolitan songs in drag. Their lives are divided between working as prostitutes on the streets of Naples, and performing, strangely enough, at family celebrations like baptisms, first communions and weddings. Neapolitan director Emanuela Pirelli reveals the lives of the femminielli, their passions and problems. They carry on an ancient yet modern art; an art that is worlds away from drag queen performances, but has provided the inspiration for them.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/i1gH06tgkhfJo3nkNZyiIy4D0Ok.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Coccinelle – Sceneggiata Transessuale","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5100054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gennaro de Vito","original_name":"Gennaro de Vito","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"self","credit_id":"67516e31ab6cc3a4c8fc5567","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5100055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio de Vito","original_name":"Antonio de Vito","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"self (Coccinella/Tonino)","credit_id":"67516e49ab37fcd3e88504f6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5100056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clementina Coppola","original_name":"Clementina Coppola","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"self","credit_id":"67516e533494cc9bfbc5fa2c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5100059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmen Russo","original_name":"Carmen Russo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"self","credit_id":"67516e81ab6cc3a4c8fc558b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5100061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Genny Prato","original_name":"Genny Prato","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"self","credit_id":"67516e8cab6cc3a4c8fc559d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5100062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giacinto Acierno","original_name":"Giacinto Acierno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"self","credit_id":"67516e9d871a42c9c24507ae","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2339730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emanuela Pirelli","original_name":"Emanuela Pirelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d06b7450e0a261357d18ddc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.719,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i1gH06tgkhfJo3nkNZyiIy4D0Ok.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":539}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
