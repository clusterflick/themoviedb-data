He lives in Los Angeles. Kept by an Iranian family, he speaks mostly Farsi. Sometimes Babash mixes English and Azeri into his conversations. Behrouz Rae has made friends with Babash over the years. The short film Babash is an associative portrait about a special relationship and the domestic surroundings in which it grew. Observing Babash and Behrouz, intervening upon them with color panels, inventing a common language, a focus emerges of a shared misplacement within this genuine friendship.” —Lisa Truttman & Behrouz Rae","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/2FK27onX0aYrbLA7V7fIs5Ns79m.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Babash","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1951056,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa Truttmann","original_name":"Lisa Truttmann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/75cY8kY0ykZke1CxAjEgWSAZvSW.jpg","credit_id":"5d085169c3a36829c21dc9bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Behrouz Rae","original_name":"Behrouz Rae","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d0851770e0a2662dec998fc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1656,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2FK27onX0aYrbLA7V7fIs5Ns79m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1104}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
