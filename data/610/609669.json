This is 'Jose' Abdul Rahman's story. In 1978 Jose, eight at the time, was hiding on Mount Matebian when a plane dropped a bomb, killing 22 of his family. He survived, fled the mountain and started following an Indonesian Battalion. The soldiers forced Jose, and many other boys, to work as porters. In 1979 the soldiers took the children by ship to Indonesia.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":201541,"logo_path":null,"name":"FairTrade Films","origin_country":""},{"id":201542,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dili Film Works","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TP","name":"East Timor"},{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"},{"iso_3166_1":"TL","name":"Timor-Leste"}],"release_date":"2019-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abdul & José","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"アブドゥルとジョゼ","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Abdul et José","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"TL","title":"Labarik Nebe Ema Naok","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2561486,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lurdes Pires","original_name":"Lurdes Pires","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647ecff593828e0116260225","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1328825,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bety Reis","original_name":"Bety Reis","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647ecfd793828e011626020b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2561488,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stella Zammataro","original_name":"Stella Zammataro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647ed0660e29a22be32857eb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1328824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luigi Acquisto","original_name":"Luigi Acquisto","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d08e16b0e0a26317aca6cb9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7239884","wikidata_id":"Q55864852","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-02-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Timor-Leste Film Festival","release_date":"2021-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"MY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"RTTL","release_date":"2017-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
