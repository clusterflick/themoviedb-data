Culled from a year of unprecedented access to Queen Elizabeth II, the documentary trails the queen as she interacts one-on-one with her family, her staff, her public, and international heads of state. Go behind closed doors for Christmas with the royal family, eavesdrop on cocktail chatter with Ron and Nancy Reagan, and catch unguarded moments when the queen pilots her own jeep or romps with her dogs. Elizabeth R. is a once-in-a-lifetime glimpse into the everyday life of a queen.","popularity":0.6084,"poster_path":"/ie9wogegwhBuoxnP19Gt3u3501c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elizabeth R: A Year in the Life of The Queen","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":558240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom","original_name":"Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom","popularity":0.4598,"profile_path":"/rO3H0ndtekEtNzRScYQMREiB3gI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60150dea55b0c0004076f69a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Holm","original_name":"Ian Holm","popularity":1.4643,"profile_path":"/9YbuYOqOmYwReBAj9Hh6z7DWwhH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self - Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"631a5fc76f43ec0080552c6e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1220630,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Antony Jay","original_name":"Antony Jay","popularity":0.1037,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"631a6014880c9200987eb756","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1251771,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Edward Mirzoeff","original_name":"Edward Mirzoeff","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"631a6105880c9200987eb784","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3562,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rachel Portman","original_name":"Rachel Portman","popularity":0.2666,"profile_path":"/Am3W0n5fPR7hepTR0c1X7RC1zZO.jpg","credit_id":"631a60244c1bb000874487f8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1354496,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Philip Bonham-Carter","original_name":"Philip Bonham-Carter","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"631a605afac50200a2c1a59f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1251771,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Edward Mirzoeff","original_name":"Edward Mirzoeff","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"631a5fe71d1bf400797efd38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1251771,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Edward Mirzoeff","original_name":"Edward Mirzoeff","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"631a5ff96f43ec0099cefe34","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569599,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alan Lygo","original_name":"Alan Lygo","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"631a606b6f43ec0080552c86","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0986227","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1JlDcLGXivzIVq5x029orNPjIlW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":788,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ie9wogegwhBuoxnP19Gt3u3501c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":525}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2471,"name":"monarchy"},{"id":220649,"name":"british monarchy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1992-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Broadcast on PBS","release_date":"1992-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
