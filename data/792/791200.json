The boss is in love with the pretty typist. He tells her he wants a man right away, and she telephones her husband to come down. He gets the job, which is that of porter. While hubby sweeps the floors and cleans the cuspidors, the boss is holding wifey's hand in the private office. Another suitor, who, also, does not know the stenographer is married, tries to see her and is kicked out by the boss. He tells his troubles to the porter, and then rushes off to tell the boss's wife, for revenge. Hubby listens at the door and is caught by the boss, who tips him to stop spying. The boss's wife, a two-hundred-pounder, arrives just as hubby has gotten up his courage to heat up the boss, and a lively scrimmage ensues.","popularity":0.0848,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4148,"logo_path":null,"name":"Keystone Film Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hubby’s Job","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Mace","original_name":"Fred Mace","popularity":0.0853,"profile_path":"/ahTGVz2AcD9xemfzWpcUdcWVZnt.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Hubby","credit_id":"601329f5c4f552003cf05f95","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mabel Normand","original_name":"Mabel Normand","popularity":0.1646,"profile_path":"/7aSeqYhxHaqd0wCHE9yaXu9XWOV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Wifey","credit_id":"60132a05c8a2d4003ff396a2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chester Conklin","original_name":"Chester Conklin","popularity":0.3457,"profile_path":"/qaEgtSQU4eTX2fMng7Grc7G2xzq.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67ed9906b9424cd895ab1414","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":945877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dot Farley","original_name":"Dot Farley","popularity":0.1282,"profile_path":"/sMOaVJca2FnFIRUs6L8zIuXAZnV.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67ed99128fed3f0236ab0152","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry McCoy","original_name":"Harry McCoy","popularity":0.0788,"profile_path":"/pjJnpVjuW5fe7VsAw126XnOz9Nj.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67ed99253d8e74e5180141fd","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89518,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mack Sennett","original_name":"Mack Sennett","popularity":0.2719,"profile_path":"/24XTSL0AbuT6gzjqAFhpc4fkEts.jpg","credit_id":"60132a17b5bc21003e9a50a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89518,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mack Sennett","original_name":"Mack Sennett","popularity":0.2719,"profile_path":"/24XTSL0AbuT6gzjqAFhpc4fkEts.jpg","credit_id":"67ed993c3d8e74e518014203","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0002992","wikidata_id":"Q18463668","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"},{"id":347476,"name":"split reel"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1913-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
