Set in a dingy Lower East Side apartment in the 1980s, Beirut follows the story of Torch, a young man who is in quarantine after testing positive to a nameless disease. His girlfriend, refuses to leave him isolating alone. It’s raunchy, it’s real, it’s poetic; and it reminds us of the power of stories, and their role in fostering hope, solidarity and documentation of extraordinary times.","popularity":0.7511,"poster_path":"/aV5Iw4sXAMDXMVpF21lOd9o5xgg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145567,"logo_path":null,"name":"MCC Theater","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beirut: An MCC Virtual TV Event","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Beirut","type":"shortened"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marisa Tomei","original_name":"Marisa Tomei","popularity":2.6542,"profile_path":"/5w6qM8FWsl5SutKSpx6Va64eCTE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Blue","credit_id":"60137cecd9f4a6003f3d9ae4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar Isaac","original_name":"Oscar Isaac","popularity":7.3804,"profile_path":"/dW5U5yrIIPmMjRThR9KT2xH6nTz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Torch","credit_id":"60137cf30816c7004082bcce","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Breen","original_name":"Patrick Breen","popularity":0.608,"profile_path":"/oGK78qN4cezMlG7VBvZ0QYh1Ui0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Guard","credit_id":"60137cfa458199003c250c12","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2956287,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ted Stephens III","original_name":"Ted Stephens III","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60137d2d46f354003eb8a8e8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2956288,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tony Cotte","original_name":"Tony Cotte","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60137d34e72fe8003fee5301","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1281214,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alan Bowne","original_name":"Alan Bowne","popularity":0.062,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60137d0c99d5c30041598de0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2956286,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sinan Zafar","original_name":"Sinan Zafar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60137d1e99d5c300405ac7fa","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2956289,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Brendan Whipple","original_name":"Brendan Whipple","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60137d3b3009aa003eb5116b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2956285,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Wontorek","original_name":"Paul Wontorek","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60137d15cb8028003e0993b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13936718","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aV5Iw4sXAMDXMVpF21lOd9o5xgg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":264598,"name":"tv special"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"MCC Theater","release_date":"2020-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
