Because the local human rights organizations do not care about LGBT issues either. That is why the young activists take the possible dangers and fight for their rights themselves.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/xlEgt8p45gn14LpODWRin3shYXb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Queer Tunesia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2820248,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Falk Steinborn","original_name":"Falk Steinborn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6014c6a6d96c3c00410d5be9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xlEgt8p45gn14LpODWRin3shYXb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
