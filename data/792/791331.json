Parents and grandparents scurry around. Pictures of Senem's first visit to Turkey, so she tells us. This is the beginning of a search for home. Through interviews with her parents and grandparents, the filmmaker takes us through the ups and downs of the life of three generations of Turkish guest workers in Germany. The stories are accompanied by images of everyday life in Turkey. Today the family has returned to their homeland, only Senem has remained in Germany. Where does she belong? Sober reflection meets poetic collage, trying to find peace in the space between here and there.","popularity":0.1603,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":31052,"logo_path":"/pJgQoO1PyJdhOP1UOrVsDeolYw7.png","name":"Deutsche Film- und Fernsehakademie Berlin (DFFB)","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Turkish Riviera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2426599,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Senem Göcmen","original_name":"Senem Göcmen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618821ec1c6aa70060f1e774","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2426599,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Senem Göcmen","original_name":"Senem Göcmen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618821e4160e7300675185aa","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3300686,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"El Fallah Khaless","original_name":"El Fallah Khaless","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618821ffcb6db50042c4d30c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2426599,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Senem Göcmen","original_name":"Senem Göcmen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618821c07d41aa008e27dec2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2426599,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Senem Göcmen","original_name":"Senem Göcmen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618821d870309f002a108f64","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14270938","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
