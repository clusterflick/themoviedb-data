Far ahead of all existing branches of physical and cosmological sciences, the interdimensional science of Unarius teaches the fourth-dimensional physics of interstellar communication. Uriel, director and cofounder of Unarius, has been in mental contact with 32 other worlds within our galaxy. She provides evidence to transcend the egocentric, myopic viewpoint that we are alone in the universe. The descriptive narrative and graphic portrayals of Uriel's contact with seven of these planets, members of the Interplanetary Confederation, provide information enabling one to be able to conceive extraterrestrial life!","popularity":0.0758,"poster_path":"/e72gurVj7HN0cpGD2iBqucSktrM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Restoration, Vol 1","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1708288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Norman","original_name":"Ruth Norman","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"60157eae976a23003ca34c30","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e72gurVj7HN0cpGD2iBqucSktrM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
