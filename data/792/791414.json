Opera in three acts (1850)\r Libretto by Francesco Maria Piave after Le Pasteur, ou l’Évangile et le Foyer by Émile Souvestre and Eugène Bourgeois  Graham Vick’s innovative staging of the ‘most unjustly neglected of Verdi’s operas', Stiffelio, was presented with a Special Award at the 37th 'Franco Abbiati' Music Critics' Prize (2018) for the director's unique theatricality and the unprecedented level of audience involvement. Performed at the Teatro Farnese on four mobile platforms, the audience was free to move around the auditorium and choose their own vantage points, mingling with actors, chorus members and cameramen.  The Italian tenor, Luciano Ganci (Stiffelio), and the Mexican soprano, Maria Katzarava (Lina), deliver tense and dramatic performances in what was the highlight of the 2017 Festival Verdi in Parma.","popularity":0.0672,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stiffelio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2957083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luciano Ganci","original_name":"Luciano Ganci","popularity":0.0741,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Stiffelio","credit_id":"60145580be2d490040fea8c2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2612031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Katzarava","original_name":"Maria Katzarava","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/hNPzQCswTj0alC8EP4DhI4No0n7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lina","credit_id":"601455943e09f3003c3f49e2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2957085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco Landolfi","original_name":"Francesco Landolfi","popularity":0.08,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Count Stankar","credit_id":"601455acd96c3c003e0dab1f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2957086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giovanni Sala","original_name":"Giovanni Sala","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Raffaele","credit_id":"601455bcd7cd06003c04fcc7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2445209,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emanuele Cordaro","original_name":"Emanuele Cordaro","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Jorg","credit_id":"601455d4cb8028004008567d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2957087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cecilia Bernini","original_name":"Cecilia Bernini","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Dorotea","credit_id":"601455ea3e09f3003f3f7570","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1950817,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blagoj Nacoski","original_name":"Blagoj Nacoski","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Federico di Frengel","credit_id":"601456081511aa0040516738","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2957091,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Guillermo Garcia Calvo","original_name":"Guillermo Garcia Calvo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6014561f1b70ae003c5f13d6","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15130,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giuseppe Verdi","original_name":"Giuseppe Verdi","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":"/3W2HAqexkcpK6mWG3vseRlhD1ep.jpg","credit_id":"6014562a5b4fed00409f5886","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1563712,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Graham Vick","original_name":"Graham Vick","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601456373009aa003eb61898","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
