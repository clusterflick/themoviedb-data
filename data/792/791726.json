Betihno, a young boy living with his tarvern owner uncle, has never seen this Julia. Legend has it that she never leaves the house, as she is hideously swollen from daily beatings. No one would say why Saide is always beating her up. One day the little boy discovers that Julia was once the love of his uncle. One day Betihno is left to look after the shop while his uncle goes to watch a contortionist’s show, and comes face to face with Saide. In a few moments, the truth about Julia will come out.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/3dH9OCgywr1idvIIXjYPGsoNkzz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gaze of the Stars","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2958232,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"João Ribeiro","original_name":"João Ribeiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60158dbdd96c3c00400f1841","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3dH9OCgywr1idvIIXjYPGsoNkzz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
