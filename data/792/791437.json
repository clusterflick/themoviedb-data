But their snowball bowling game goes awry, and Totodile's snowball knocks a passing Delibird out of the sky! Delibird crashes down onto Meowth and Wobbuffet, who were out for an innocent stroll, but a wild Skarmory is annoyed at the racket and sends them all blasting off. Delibird has another bumpy landing, and now it's in a panic because it's lost all the presents that were in its sack. If they're not found by midnight, they won't be delivered for Christmas! Fortunately, Pikachu and its friends will help Delibird find all the presents.","popularity":0.902,"poster_path":"/uEiAZkT1wuj7xdQBGXEnNNV8zRb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5372,"logo_path":"/tPtJc2rCOTHEzJQPStT6m3dI0eK.png","name":"OLM","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":5261,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shogakukan Production","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":9149,"logo_path":"/isLUpud9N56ifftJZ4XvzwBBpoG.png","name":"Shogakukan","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":3034,"logo_path":"/jnuO8pZNEBLEq5YaOP1f5OkmG91.png","name":"TV Tokyo","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":7967,"logo_path":"/4W9ByL6mMDn9UOHh8oGD36l3BnN.png","name":"Media Factory","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":12288,"logo_path":"/e4dQAqZD374H5EuM0W1ljEBWTKy.png","name":"Nintendo","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":11644,"logo_path":"/1fhfHRzI3GrXRjfuGTLaERshdzu.png","name":"Tomy","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":12307,"logo_path":null,"name":"Creatures","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":5399,"logo_path":null,"name":"GAME FREAK","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":8157,"logo_path":"/pEqcMX1aG3JvtDgfh2wNZJLCcb4.png","name":"jeki","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":198169,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pikachu Project 2000","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2000-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pichu & Pikachu's Winter Vacation 2001","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":73044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ikue Otani","original_name":"大谷育江","popularity":0.9942,"profile_path":"/my8LBLQ4MsK4hRz1PAATIqtieaI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Pikachu (voice)","credit_id":"601476f255b0c0003e75ee47","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kappei Yamaguchi","original_name":"山口勝平","popularity":1.489,"profile_path":"/mJyxKRZxLv9D7LH5KcNSkjSKYOB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Delibird (voice)","credit_id":"601477263009aa003fb5bc63","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":40332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rikako Aikawa","original_name":"愛河里花子","popularity":0.3914,"profile_path":"/cpyaO7u3wqdsEF1p8BPg8fpezBP.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Aipom (voice)","credit_id":"6014776055b0c0003f75ea0d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2070865,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Masaaki Iwane","original_name":"岩根雅明","popularity":0.0532,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649f65b1d5191f00ac919455","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2070865,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Masaaki Iwane","original_name":"岩根雅明","popularity":0.0532,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649f65ac8c0a4800c763492e","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Key Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kunihiko Yuyama","original_name":"湯山邦彦","popularity":0.538,"profile_path":"/9QxCIKt17L03eIBRWXWYqphsyUx.jpg","credit_id":"601476bdbf0f63003f0b43e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":567064,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shouji Yonemura","original_name":"米村正二","popularity":0.2936,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601476c83009aa0041b69f64","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3457326","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1880,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uEiAZkT1wuj7xdQBGXEnNNV8zRb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1253}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1442,"name":"winter"},{"id":207317,"name":"christmas"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
