In one corner is Daphna Feygenbam, a “Real Jew” who is volatile, self-assure, and unbending. In the other is her equally stubborn cousin Liam, a secular and entitled young man, who has his shiksa girlfriend, Melody, in tow. Stuck in the middle is Liam’s brother, Jonah, who tries to stay out of the fray. When Liam stakes claim to their grandfather's Chai necklace, a vicious and hilarious brawl over family, faith, and legacy ensues.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ehrF2CgJs9e1iNErtYc5CZA25eo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":136773,"logo_path":null,"name":"Short North Stage","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bad Jews","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2955885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jake Lowenthal","original_name":"Jake Lowenthal","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Liam Haber","credit_id":"6013014c0e597b003f395aeb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2955887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Winneg","original_name":"Annie Winneg","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Daphna Feygenbaum","credit_id":"60130166c4f552003ff01407","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2955889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Cosgrove","original_name":"Nick Cosgrove","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jonah Haber","credit_id":"60130175fd4a96003f34ff85","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2955892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ali Foley","original_name":"Ali Foley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Melody","credit_id":"601301891b70ae003d5c135b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2702775,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward Carignan","original_name":"Edward Carignan","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601301a20e597b00403a5058","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2955894,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Joe Tyson","original_name":"Joe Tyson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601301b9d96c3c00400b88ff","department":"Crew","job":"Technical Supervisor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1856,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ehrF2CgJs9e1iNErtYc5CZA25eo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1237}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
