The date turns out to be an 18 year boy, who reminds him of his own son. A son he hasnâ€™t seen since his divorce and who he thinks might hate him for his choice of sexuality. Though the main protagonist is gay, he claims to be a bisexual, because there is a misconception that being a bisexual can be considered to be less queer. Here the roles are reversed as it is this 18-year-old kid, who in the course of one night, helps him come face to face with his sexuality.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/imw0AoLNyF6OSuPFw6t4kDCAYPI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sandclock","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2958211,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deepak Miglani","original_name":"Deepak Miglani","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601587eb8a88b2003f98d7ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/imw0AoLNyF6OSuPFw6t4kDCAYPI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
