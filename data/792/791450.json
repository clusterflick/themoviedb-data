As a trailblazing exponent of minimalist music, Reich rejected the characteristic complexity of mid-20th-century classical harmony and tonality in order to make large-scale works from minimal materials a single chord, a brief musical motif, a spoken exclamation – thereby reconciling sacred and popular music.  In this profile he looks back on the key stages of his 40-years lasting career, from the formation of his own group, Steve Reich and Musicians, to the American avant-garde he helped to create, from new video performances to his quasi-religious music. Despite his success and wide recognition Steve Reich has never renounced his independent spirit.","popularity":0.0767,"poster_path":"/yjiGhNtalf9lr6JRoFPU3S6dhgh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":92126,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mémoire Magnétique","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2011-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Portrait of the musician","title":"Steve Reich: Phase to Face","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1119269,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Steve Reich","original_name":"Steve Reich","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/74RqDTZoQHYE40VpIoLIoNqLCPH.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60147bae0816c7003f82ceca","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1846403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Éric Darmon","original_name":"Éric Darmon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60147b6a1511aa0040519e0b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1846404,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Franck Mallet","original_name":"Franck Mallet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60147b8ec3c891004443af34","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1415,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yjiGhNtalf9lr6JRoFPU3S6dhgh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD","release_date":"2011-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
