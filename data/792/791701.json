For nineteenth century women, quilts were the podium, the pulpit and the judges' gavel, which their society denied them. Their quilts speak the language of abolition, patriotism, politics, social justice, and westward expansion.","popularity":0.0389,"poster_path":"/paRPv2H2I8T2kgL3Wa9s6ptpyhc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hearts & Hands","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Hearts and Hands: 19th Century Women and Their Quilts","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":142242,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Beth Ferris","original_name":"Beth Ferris","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6660eadde1b697234d008858","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1895761,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pat Ferrero","original_name":"Pat Ferrero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60157c73b5bc21003e9e070e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0770461","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1548,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/paRPv2H2I8T2kgL3Wa9s6ptpyhc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1032}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"PBS","release_date":"1988-12-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
