It's a lovely story, told well. The reason that I tracked it down is because I'm quite a fan of Alice Sailor's music. She fronts new wave band Amaryllis and I was curious to see her acting. She has frequently supplied theme songs and other music to several of Tomomatsu's films. Indeed, the most disturbing sequence in this movie is accompanied by a psychotic Amaryllis track, 'Haha', and the closing piece is another Amaryllis song, 'Usagi'. This rip comes from the 'Eat The Schoolgirl' DVD, where it was one of the extras. Having just watched the main feature from that disc, I can say with some certainty that I found this tale far more enjoyable.","popularity":0.1526,"poster_path":"/iYpyKA7Qjv8iHTlCfjVZIzaf9K3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1992-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Summer Romance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Naoyuki Tomomatsu","original_name":"友松直之","popularity":0.4637,"profile_path":"/kIPhpJJDgSWd4iIsDWemOQ4vZc0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"60143360bf0f6300410b666c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1958346,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alice Sailor","original_name":"Alice Sailor","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6014336e0816c7003f827bb4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shinji Kubo","original_name":"久保新二","popularity":0.2298,"profile_path":"/e1s3VcnS55bbCB85Kc0T6eyGqQs.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6014337a1511aa0040512b30","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Naoyuki Tomomatsu","original_name":"友松直之","popularity":0.4637,"profile_path":"/kIPhpJJDgSWd4iIsDWemOQ4vZc0.jpg","credit_id":"601433515ad76b003e71a393","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Naoyuki Tomomatsu","original_name":"友松直之","popularity":0.4637,"profile_path":"/kIPhpJJDgSWd4iIsDWemOQ4vZc0.jpg","credit_id":"601433575ad76b003e71a396","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0204380","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iYpyKA7Qjv8iHTlCfjVZIzaf9K3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Japanese\", \"english_name\"=>\"Japanese\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"ja\", \"native_name\"=>\"Japanese\"}","note":"","release_date":"1992-08-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
