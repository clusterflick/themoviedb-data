The team was joined by the heavyweight poet Imants Ziedonis and Herz Frank as script writers.  Instead of one of the old, merited, medal rattling ‘combat camera- men’, “Year in Review” is an unusually vivid and unique film for the time.  The creative team were awarded the State Prize for the film.","popularity":0.1835,"poster_path":"/OFn0Ym6ng9qJAYHx4gp3pkgvs0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82801,"logo_path":"/8h6Ugz5S1DiX7kaeg19eQKXsS4q.png","name":"Rīgas kinostudija","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1965-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Year in Review","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Report of the Year","type":"alternative English title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1283198,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aivars Freimanis","original_name":"Aivars Freimanis","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/hsXLex55gBSkZcg1WHszPCRLNCc.jpg","credit_id":"60131ff80816c7003f817766","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1483683,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Imants Ziedonis","original_name":"Imants Ziedonis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/fplsPrzfVAYsewMluWk3x0P5MY7.jpg","credit_id":"6013200d1b70ae003c5d2b27","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1203057,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Herz Frank","original_name":"Herz Frank","popularity":0.088,"profile_path":"/oyMPlFiwKwmm2OQxHBuZ8Kl1DSS.jpg","credit_id":"60132023cb8028003e090aa9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1201926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivars Seleckis","original_name":"Ivars Seleckis","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/fTMcZgbtqfFFxUhgTTc5rwUaQ4s.jpg","credit_id":"6013203c46f354003fb94b02","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1970848,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ļudgards Gedravičs","original_name":"Ļudgards Gedravičs","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60132053869e7500447ad776","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/OFn0Ym6ng9qJAYHx4gp3pkgvs0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":602}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1965-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
