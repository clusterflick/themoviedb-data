Updated making Greg a military veteran turned pastor. Still trying to win over a skeptical congregation, recovered war veteran turned Pastor, gears up for his first Christmas sermon. As God would have it, his plans take an unexpected turn. Pastor Greg cashes in on a shopping spree the day of his much- anticipated sermon. In a frenzy to get back in time, he unwittingly gets stuck in an elevator along with cohorts Lori, John, Frank and a pregnant woman. The surprise ending will have the congregation and viewing audiences on the edge of their seats. Creator Greg Robbins added a few new meaningful moments, a bit of chaos, topped with great giggles to this already fun story. A new cast with the same silliness.","popularity":0.32,"poster_path":"/lGXnCc7dG6zcYGZI2HcwmTxEhXI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hope For Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":156100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Sizemore","original_name":"Kevin Sizemore","popularity":0.2342,"profile_path":"/83ceJvDsSMMU4KoNcW39lvWrHTK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tom","credit_id":"6012c90199d5c3003e592d97","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1416444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josie DiVincenzo","original_name":"Josie DiVincenzo","popularity":0.0664,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Charlie","credit_id":"6012c915458199003f22eeb4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1747126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Mesi","original_name":"Linda Mesi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Phyllis","credit_id":"6012c92b869e75003e7a5a26","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1226097,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peter Johnson","original_name":"Peter Johnson","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Pastor Flo","credit_id":"6012c93fccde04003f28e1ed","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2403188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gregory P.
