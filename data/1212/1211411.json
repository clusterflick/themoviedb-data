However, Jeff faces a problem as his magic hat won't function outside the store, preventing him from joining them. Undeterred, he sneaks into the costume box bound for the theatre. Upon arrival, Muffy is late, prompting Jodie and Sam to begin the show without her. Meanwhile, Jeff, trapped in the box, finds himself turned into a mannequin without his magic working.
