But what about these workers’ European dreams? Will they be ground to a pulp?  Our canned tomatoes are picked by migrant workers who have come to southern Italy to realise their dream of Europe. However, they never get beyond the tomato fields. This documentary shows how the tomato broaches a broader issue. Will the pickers keep believing in their dream, or fight against a Europe where others reap the sweet rewards of their disillusion?","popularity":0.3459,"poster_path":"/iwNRBN5oCb30bkTlDv62Go9GlTX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99831,"logo_path":null,"name":"De Nederlandse
