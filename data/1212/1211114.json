For the first time on film, Touching The Game Alaska takes a captivating inside look at this fascinating institution and its incredible history as a proving-ground for more than 500 Major Leaguers and Hall of Famers like Tom Seaver and Dave Winfield, many of whom appear in the film.  This feature length documentary is highlighted by superb baseball, stunning imagery and humorous anecdotes, from planes crashing on fields during games to bear encounters to salmon fishing misadventures to the more than century old tradition of the Midnight Sun Game.  Four years in the making, the film not only showcases baseball played in a place where the summer sun never sets, but also gives insight into the colorful, rugged and fiercely independent people of this frontier land.","popularity":0.2358,"poster_path":"/1qG1yM5Px1HwdZfY002W9vOj36u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Touching The Game Alaska","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1440357","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1qG1yM5Px1HwdZfY002W9vOj36u.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vu3GkKIooLZMmhsvCVL7a04SYrR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1480,"name":"baseball"},{"id":9880,"name":"alaska"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Touching the Game, Alaska  (trailer)","key":"uHSgyq5Xzk0","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2010-04-28T19:48:29.000Z","id":"65661633156cc700ca706c4b"}]}}}
