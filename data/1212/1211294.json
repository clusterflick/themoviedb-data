Moss Tie Company of St. Louis in the 1920s. Thanks to release of the film by the Kerr-McGee Chemical Corporation, the rare footage in \"Stamp of Character\" takes us through the entire process of making railroad ties, at a time when forests covered almost two-thirds of the state. The original silent motion picture was shown in movie theaters as an advertisement by the T.J. Moss Tie Company. Using digitally edited narration and realistic sound effects, this video makes the past live again.","popularity":0.6465,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":180921,"logo_path":null,"name":"Missouri Department of Conservation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stamp of Character","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3825493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joneal Joplin","original_name":"Joneal Joplin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"65696b29ea37e000ea46a9b0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4406285,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Glenn Chambers","original_name":"Glenn Chambers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65696b73d399e600ab2988cb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4406279,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Bruce Palmer","original_name":"Bruce Palmer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65696ab263536a013954424a","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4406281,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tom Troughton","original_name":"Tom Troughton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65696adbb7d352012c39a41c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4406281,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tom Troughton","original_name":"Tom Troughton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65696afab7d352014d25a824","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5900,"name":"missouri"},{"id":18044,"name":"railroad"},{"id":167951,"name":"st. louis, missouri"},{"id":207917,"name":"ozarks"},{"id":211143,"name":"conservation"},{"id":275787,"name":"railroad construction"},{"id":280241,"name":"forestry"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Only year is certain.","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Stamp of Character (1995)","key":"jNstKvUUVGE","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2017-07-24T12:30:01.000Z","id":"6566d3d4a8b2ca012c14852e"}]}}}
