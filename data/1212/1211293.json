The film is centered on a case study: the never-completed Nazi resort of Prora, on Germanyâ€™s Baltic Sea, which was built on a mammoth scale beginning in 1936 to house 20,000 vacationing working-class Germans. This 4-mile-long building was used in propaganda to forward a promise of leisure time for the masses and strengthen sympathies between the workers and the Nazi party. Although the Nazis left the site unfinished, the Socialist East German government continued construction in the 1950s, using it for military training as well as housing for conscientious objectors pressed into labor by the GDR regime. After decades of abandonment, the massive edifice is now being redeveloped into apartments, condominiums, hotels, and a youth hostel.","popularity":0.2324,"poster_path":"/PqC62AZ4RQSMnCfeJsn8tWEAKB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Can a building be guilty?","title":"Touristic Intents","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4402753,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mat Rappaport","original_name":"Mat Rappaport","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6566ceb26c0b36011e17eb99","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15745366","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/PqC62AZ4RQSMnCfeJsn8tWEAKB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":221238,"name":"architecture history"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
