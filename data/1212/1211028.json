He can’t be: whenever The Lamb leaves camp, the goal is always to bring back at least one more Cult of the Lamb follower. It’s doubly important when your one true love can leave this world at a moment’s notice. Of course… that’s when you just quickly have yourself a Cult of the Lamb marriage. Look, when you’ve got the power, you can pretty much do what you want.  The thing is that some supporters can turn nasty when they think your Cult of the Lamb is poop. They might just start calling it Cult of the Lamb Poop… and then want to eat poop and… it becomes a whole thing. Then you’ve got yourself a Cult of the Lamb dissenter, and no one needs that; not I, not ewe. It’s time for a mass Cult of the Lamb sacrifice, baby!","popularity":0.0506,"poster_path":"/3rJJMW2zl2lfUOn4YjVjIcqzYjF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cult Of The Lamb: Doom & Shroom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/IYQoaN3VC26LF4lZkozVwtHkzZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2835,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3rJJMW2zl2lfUOn4YjVjIcqzYjF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1913},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rkgV6uAUCzk5ZuAXzlS27h0hC7K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
