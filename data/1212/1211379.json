A few lines that stand out as the ultimate test for skiers. Lines that have seen one, maybe two, ski descents in history. One such mountain that is on that list is Mt. St. Elias in Alaska.  Mt. St. Elias is a mythical, foreboding peak that jumps straight out of the ocean, 18,008 feet into the sky. It's renowned for violent storms that come straight off the northern pacific and slam into its icy steeps. It is unknown how many people have ever stood on the summit, but it is known that most people that try, fail.  In May of 2021, Cody Townsend, Dan Corn, Nick Russell and cinematographer Bjarne Salen set out to climb and ski this Alaskan beast. This is the tale of their adventure.","popularity":0.2452,"poster_path":"/gBLJ88o4xTY7WMfVMbK95tjUlcD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":214666,"logo_path":null,"name":"Summit Lunch Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":214667,"logo_path":null,"name":"B.COLECTIVE","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-29","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"backcountry skiing documentary","title":"Summit Fever","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Summit Fever - The FIFTY","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":224398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cody Townsend","original_name":"Cody Townsend","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/kQO8X1Qtr3KJZHxEWE3MHyaUnN7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65672a8ba8b2ca014d51c1a1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4403075,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Corn","original_name":"Dan Corn","popularity":0.055,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65672aa9a8b2ca014d51c1be","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4403076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Russell","original_name":"Nick Russell","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65672abc89d97f011b4d725e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2072649,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bjarne Salén","original_name":"Bjarne Salén","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65672ac76c0b360101fbd632","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2072649,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bjarne Salén","original_name":"Bjarne Salén","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65672ad289d97f011b4d7269","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1238,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gvsCQzx8U3FQSDT8Scyxjim48xJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2200}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":788,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gBLJ88o4xTY7WMfVMbK95tjUlcD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":525}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":186823,"name":"backcountry"},{"id":248915,"name":"skiing"},{"id":309328,"name":"documentary short"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-12-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Summit Fever - The FIFTY | FULL MOVIE - Mt.
