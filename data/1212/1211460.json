He sets on a journey of redemption, in search of the truth regarding numerous rumors while confronting his worst fears. This is an extraordinary, inspirational story, connecting two extreme worlds of our existence on this disputed land, where Arabs and Jews, orthodox and seculars, right and left, mix brutally in one character. It is a story of hatred and rivalry, but mostly a story about ignorance, where an inner search leads to catharsis and the freeing of oneâ€™s own identity.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A life shrouded in a lie.
