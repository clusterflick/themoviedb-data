How far from the South Zone the Baixada Fluminense is found? Is it far enough for a region not know the other one? What are the (in)visible barriers that prevent an approximation?  \"Nunca fui, mas me disseram...\" is a fun documentary that approaches, in an smart manner, the South Zone residents' view about the Baixada Fluminense. Independent and experimental, the film brings up questions about media manipulation, prejudice, the segregation between regions of the same state and auto-protection; without the pretentions of answering or clarifying something, only to argue about the stigmas' origin.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Never went there, but they told me about it...","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4402505,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacqueline Martins","original_name":"Jacqueline Martins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6566a585156cc700ebc15564","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4402506,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Priscila Marques","original_name":"Priscila Marques","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6566a599156cc7014e6645e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4402508,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taisa Moreno","original_name":"Taisa Moreno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6566a5c56c0b360101fb9556","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4402503,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruno Vianna","original_name":"Bruno Vianna","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6566a5536c0b360101fb94f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4402510,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Verônica Trindade","original_name":"Verônica Trindade","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6566a5d9156cc700ebc155b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
