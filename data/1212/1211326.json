Schomburgk’s affirmative images show slave labour, humiliation and the arrogance of the colonial power. The material is contrasted by Gehrts’ romanticising diary entries and other colonial reports which often testify to a horrifying coldness.","popularity":0.2882,"poster_path":"/uqS2xW25bOyfvsBlKVfH4aTr6FU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"TG","name":"Togo"}],"release_date":"2024-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Togoland Projections","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1590636,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jürgen Ellinghaus","original_name":"Jürgen Ellinghaus","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6566ff33a349110138e69ca7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rrnbI4qFQnuQYM0FfllMbnT6gVC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/udkxyWMfP71oj2hXGuO6UY6VH30.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4vvwIlhId4S95xqWuyDu2cn5D1D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2384,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/uqS2xW25bOyfvsBlKVfH4aTr6FU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1589}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DOK Leipzig","release_date":"2023-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
