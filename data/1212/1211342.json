It is 1976 – the year in which NASA’s Viking 1 and 2 space probes land on the surface of Mars. They send images of an only vaguely explored area from a great distance, enabling a first look into the history of an alien planet. Like the NASA scientists, the small family are hoping that their journey will give them insights into the past, an understanding of the present situation and perhaps even the chance to anticipate the future.","popularity":0.053,"poster_path":"/gBSV8wzlSoHq7a0oXIhlJ3wncd8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2023-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1976: Search for Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2387612,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tess Martin","original_name":"Tess Martin","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6567085ea3491100ac5844e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.716,"height":1791,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gBSV8wzlSoHq7a0oXIhlJ3wncd8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1283}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3371,"name":"family history"},{"id":3801,"name":"space travel"},{"id":163053,"name":"found footage"},{"id":225308,"name":"time lapse"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DOK Leipzig","release_date":"2023-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TRAILER - 1976: Search for Life","key":"860629143","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-09-03T13:48:57.000Z","id":"67d00a457761a3a68f608155"}]}}}
