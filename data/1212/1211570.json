This program uses popular 20th-century French music to explore the rich character and modern-era development of Paris. Juxtaposing commentary from French scholars, performers, and business leaders with classic recordings by Edith Piaf, Brigitte Bardot, Maurice Chevalier, and other artists, the film sheds light on the evolution of Paris and its component districts since the early 1900s. It also examines the special qualities that have made Paris a hub of art and fashion for centuries and the specific ways in which both Parisians and foreigners view the city. Contains brief nudity.","popularity":0.0601,"poster_path":"/rviGOyhTbfBN8rAKFqhvUUvWKQr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159404,"logo_path":null,"name":"Films Media Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Singing Paris: The City of Lights in 20th-Century French Music","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1091908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Édith Piaf","original_name":"Édith Piaf","popularity":0.1899,"profile_path":"/wdywqpt0Gmb6IvpTFQ3wCMarqvf.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6567c126d9542000ab659ad2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1277143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valérie Lavalle","original_name":"Valérie Lavalle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6567c3c66c0b36011e18455c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1514688,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alain Lavalle","original_name":"Alain Lavalle","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6567c3b489d97f011b4da635","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1653,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rviGOyhTbfBN8rAKFqhvUUvWKQr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1102}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
