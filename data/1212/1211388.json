The goal was simple, ride bikes, loaded down with 100 pounds of climbing, skiing and camping equipment, over 1000 miles to ski three of The Fifty Classic Ski Descents of North America. A tiring adventure and a sufferfest of course, but in the context of an ongoing global pandemic, a nation divided by chaos and a populace on the brink, a simple adventure throws the simple act of adventure into question. Why purposely suffer? Why selfishly pursue adventure? Why go into the mountains at all? All questions that a month long adventure begins to throw into your mind. Starring Cody Townsend and Michelle Parker, \"The Mountain Why\" is a ski adventure unlike any normal escape to the wild.  This is a short film in The FIFTY series and line 28, 29, and 30.","popularity":0.2286,"poster_path":"/oGMWIJv8Hwj0Zb7Ck5IkyN94ibu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7724,"logo_path":"/6QV240fIM04sZXpyLUoqhKGhf7r.png","name":"Red Bull Media House","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":214669,"logo_path":null,"name":"Summit Lunch LLC Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"backcountry skiing documentary","title":"The Mountain Why","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The FIFTY - \"The Mountain Why\"","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":224398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cody Townsend","original_name":"Cody Townsend","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/kQO8X1Qtr3KJZHxEWE3MHyaUnN7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6567301089d97f00ab166b23","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2954698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michelle Parker","original_name":"Michelle Parker","popularity":0.0605,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65673027a3491100ac58558c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":224398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cody Townsend","original_name":"Cody Townsend","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/kQO8X1Qtr3KJZHxEWE3MHyaUnN7.jpg","credit_id":"6567309e156cc7012d55ace8","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4403129,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hennie Van Jaarsveld","original_name":"Hennie Van Jaarsveld","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656730bfc2b9df00e3c23de9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":224398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cody Townsend","original_name":"Cody Townsend","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/kQO8X1Qtr3KJZHxEWE3MHyaUnN7.jpg","credit_id":"6567307fa8b2ca012c14ae1e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":224398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cody Townsend","original_name":"Cody Townsend","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/kQO8X1Qtr3KJZHxEWE3MHyaUnN7.jpg","credit_id":"6567308a156cc7014e66868b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4403127,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bryan Cole","original_name":"Bryan Cole","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656730aea3491100ac5855e1","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2072649,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bjarne Salén","original_name":"Bjarne Salén","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656730ccd954200138760c15","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1407,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vXnlxnZOhXeDvLS39jEw0GNUwZs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2500}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":984,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oGMWIJv8Hwj0Zb7Ck5IkyN94ibu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":656}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":186823,"name":"backcountry"},{"id":248915,"name":"skiing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The FIFTY - FULL MOVIE - Line 28-30/50 - \"The Mountain Why\" -  w/ Cody Townsend & Michelle Parker","key":"JyUBqDncLVA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2020-12-27T13:00:12.000Z","id":"65673153c2b9df00ada56c16"}]}}}
