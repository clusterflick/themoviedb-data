The basis of the movie is found in the poetry created by the two directors, so the film partly seems like stringed lyrical motifs, open to arbitrary interpretation, giving the impression of poetic images arranged in sequences. Combined techniques were used, so in addition to recording with a camera, pixilation, object animation, collage and liquid animation are featured.","popularity":0.2547,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"eksp111000anim111111.mp4","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4401992,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sara Škrlec","original_name":"Sara Škrlec","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"656644da89d97f00fe7c34fe","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4406742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ema Ermen Bilaver","original_name":"Ema Ermen Bilaver","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6569f26cd399e600e1056c20","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4401992,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sara Škrlec","original_name":"Sara Škrlec","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65664581156cc700ebc11873","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4406742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ema Ermen Bilaver","original_name":"Ema Ermen Bilaver","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6569f290a313b800fe1ed228","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1566,"name":"dreams"},{"id":9887,"name":"surrealism"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"},{"id":301004,"name":"nightmares"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
