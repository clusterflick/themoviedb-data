With some self-mockery they talk about their investigation and search for sources, their capitulation to the resistance of the material. Meanwhile, an archivist struggles with a mis-spooled 16mm film. Historical images splutter across the monitor of his analogue editing table. The silhouette of the factory with its towering chimneys is discernible. Site plans are shown, chemicals are blithely mixed. In an album, the filmmakers discover faded photos of female forced labourers. Suddenly, questions arise: Which stories are kept, which forgotten? Throwing away is part of his job, after all, the archivist explains in the finest Rhenish accent. What does this statement mean for the directing trio?","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Weeding","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4402878,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amelie Vierbuchen","original_name":"Amelie Vierbuchen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656700fd156cc7010cb3eefa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4402879,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lea Sprenger","original_name":"Lea Sprenger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656701076c0b3600ae500d0a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4402880,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Franca Pape","original_name":"Franca Pape","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6567010c3d7454010be1657f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
