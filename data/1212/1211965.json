His wife Lucie made a pact with him: to live, whatever the cost, while awaiting rehabilitation. During five years, the Dreyfus spouses exchanged hundreds of letters. They became a weapon of survival for Alfred.  This film is the story of the correspondence of a man and a woman who unwittingly became the unsung heroes of the case that bears their name.","popularity":0.4813,"poster_path":"/99VrIgGcex2VUlUvElmzv9OHR8x.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116479,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kepler22
