People’s deaths are as different as the social class they belong to, in a country where social inequality strongly persists. Many deaths were suspicious in nature, but nobody dared to question them. This has happened over the past 90 years (and may well continue throughout the next century), just like what the deceased warned the living in this dance: \"What we were, you are; what we are, you will be.\"","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"มรณสติ","title":"Danse Macabre","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
