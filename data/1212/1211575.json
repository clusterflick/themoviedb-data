They are the youngest ever recipient of the prestigious Ted Hughes prize and have been nominated for both the Brit and Mercury music awards.  Tempest has always found support and respect within the queer art scenes, a place close to their heart. In July 2020, they came out as non-binary, announcing that they would publish and perform under the name Kae. This film delves deep into their creative process and gains rare, intimate insights into Kaeâ€™s life throughout a period of profound personal and artistic change.","popularity":0.4084,"poster_path":"/qqILxS6KKK5028G15RIVe3491t8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117663,"logo_path":"/41ff40pak0KpRzSBf29WLlg1Xn9.png","name":"Bohemia Films Ltd","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Being Kae Tempest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3101013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kae Tempest","original_name":"Kae Tempest","popularity":0.1008,"profile_path":"/zmP6IekcpRutNZrqSKb7AZDgOZB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Themself","credit_id":"6567c50d3d7454012ccd853a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4403930,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emily McDonald","original_name":"Emily McDonald","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6567c4bae72fe800e30cd9c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187181,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Todd Austin","original_name":"Todd Austin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6567c4eda34911011b59d6a8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e6Lr5jmy6GeKuCHGe7PaRbRti5I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qqILxS6KKK5028G15RIVe3491t8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":208876,"name":"creative process"},{"id":210039,"name":"gender identity"},{"id":211563,"name":"spoken word"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
