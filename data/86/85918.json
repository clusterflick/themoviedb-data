In the 25 years that followed, the Stones have succeeded in outraging, mystifying, confusing yet always inspiring their fans. 25 X 5: The Continuing Adventures of The Rolling Stones is the first time that the Stones have gone on camera to tell their own story. Over two hours of devastatingly frank narratives by Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, Bill Wyman, and Ron Wood are underscored by rare interview segments with Brian Jones and Mick Taylor, and rare and never-before-seen archival film, video, and newsreel footage.","popularity":0.9868,"poster_path":"/dtf55qe8z2GamtbPakdx7TvAxX5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rolling Stones: 25x5 - The Continuing Adventures of The Rolling Stones","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mick Jagger","original_name":"Mick Jagger","popularity":0.6912,"profile_path":"/r1uFIYnBCDhIlqNbiTS4nDrjHrl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe49679251416c910ac28f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Richards","original_name":"Keith Richards","popularity":0.7344,"profile_path":"/t1oa5UsJMmrhNqCIks4jQnAYSQT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe49679251416c910ac293","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1429,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie Watts","original_name":"Charlie Watts","popularity":0.1312,"profile_path":"/yZUiyOV9ImKLwAczuLd7TsImC1k.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe49679251416c910ac297","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Wyman","original_name":"Bill Wyman","popularity":0.2156,"profile_path":"/hFQhBIe36MWEYJTdf3YGTINIPkj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe49679251416c910ac29b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronnie Wood","original_name":"Ronnie Wood","popularity":0.3169,"profile_path":"/x9cPzzqEOLIuvwsqfqoDTdXeeny.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe49679251416c910ac29f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":179609,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nigel Finch","original_name":"Nigel Finch","popularity":0.055,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6761ebae1166a27098d34711","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81186,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrew Solt","original_name":"Andrew Solt","popularity":0.0997,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6761ebebf22d395d76d348ee","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0174445","wikidata_id":"Q2671067","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1ZpaNEBH41IPxBFH0sjpZOaIVkN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dtf55qe8z2GamtbPakdx7TvAxX5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
