The stables are located right in an airfield, and the sound of airplanes droning around only fuels his lust to fly. \"I want to fly like the birds!\" declares the woodpecker. But the only thing the bulldog sergeant on the airfield feels Woody is competent for is clipping the horses with an electric clipper. And considering that Woody accidentally allows the clipper to clip off the sarge's shirt buttons and a long strip of hair off his chin, he may be giving Woody too much credit. Nevertheless, Woody spends his time reading \"How to Fly a Plane from the Ground Up.\" And eventually, he sneaks onto a PU-2.","popularity":0.6303,"poster_path":"/96AGlqi5IUcf12fHxfVNReEVXyU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":"/x6HLTQILKcImVQ3GvVCwy35W5fz.png","name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ace in the Hole","video":false,"vote_average":5.857,"vote_count":14,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Blanc","original_name":"Mel Blanc","popularity":1.2076,"profile_path":"/8fevv4K06TmHsYom2XfmxgKrTcd.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Woody Woodpecker (voice)","credit_id":"52fe49679251416c910ac3ab","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":226492,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ben Hardaway","original_name":"Ben Hardaway","popularity":0.0833,"profile_path":"/rCoJqfF3QdX7YpGEEbWgRCRunZV.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Woody Woodpecker (voice)","credit_id":"52fe49679251416c910ac3af","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558639,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Lovy","original_name":"Alex Lovy","popularity":0.1384,"profile_path":"/txGj5oXMl7rVvHwDQsOeichoFIH.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49679251416c910ac389","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89284,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walter Lantz","original_name":"Walter Lantz","popularity":0.2364,"profile_path":"/zf5VLzWAmW1mvVMxnMLAJquhric.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49679251416c910ac38f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111193,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Darrell Calker","original_name":"Darrell Calker","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49679251416c910ac395","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":932733,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Laverne Harding","original_name":"Laverne Harding","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49679251416c910ac39b","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":932734,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"George Dane","original_name":"George Dane","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49679251416c910ac3a1","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932735,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Les Kline","original_name":"Les Kline","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49679251416c910ac3a7","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":226492,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ben Hardaway","original_name":"Ben Hardaway","popularity":0.0833,"profile_path":"/rCoJqfF3QdX7YpGEEbWgRCRunZV.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49679251416c910ac3b5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148161,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Milt Schaffer","original_name":"Milt Schaffer","popularity":0.121,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49679251416c910ac3bb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0149583","wikidata_id":"Q4673029","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l8bwCr0seVe5m0vlz574TFv575M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/96AGlqi5IUcf12fHxfVNReEVXyU.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1170,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qteypY35FmZDdR0OQB7ESOmDmGr.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":780},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/plH4cscSz4xOG7HQIh1UVshjFZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6513,"name":"cartoon"},{"id":162365,"name":"military"},{"id":178298,"name":"woodpecker"},{"id":249953,"name":"plane"},{"id":338226,"name":"anthropomorphic"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1942-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
