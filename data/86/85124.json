This may be due to the casting of Emil Jannings, to whom restraint and subtlety were strangers. Werner Krauss, of Cabinet of Dr. Caligari fame, is on hand as the duplicitous Iago. Appearing as the unfortunate Desdemona is Lea Von Lenkeffy, better known as Lya de Putti. Produced on an elaborate scale, Othello may not be true to the letter of Shakespeare, but is undeniably a smorgasbord of visual delights.","popularity":0.8861,"poster_path":"/5bnwbfCbPgclpLe8lyqi9cJoNzx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103052,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wörner-Filmgesellschaft","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1922-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Othello","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emil Jannings","original_name":"Emil Jannings","popularity":0.1857,"profile_path":"/yX7AFfYgYit6WlPshockLsP40LB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Othello","credit_id":"584949b4c3a368141a0130d2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Werner Krauss","original_name":"Werner Krauß","popularity":0.3056,"profile_path":"/xlyS30qzcndmczxG5JdJWwJ1heI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Iago","credit_id":"584949c392514119bf01201b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1368248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ica von Lenkeffy","original_name":"Ica von Lenkeffy","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/8S3qj7qWeGtLf9j9hOHTj7HDKIl.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Desdemona","credit_id":"584949de92514157b5000222","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theodor Loos","original_name":"Theodor Loos","popularity":0.0891,"profile_path":"/9PbtusE5TJYfyQrWb6brBXuXTLX.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Cassio","credit_id":"584949f2c3a3681414013201","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35423,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ferdinand von Alten","original_name":"Ferdinand von Alten","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/3QxhovSmWMcb52I5JCfoqzQykmV.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Rodrigo","credit_id":"58494a0292514119b3011c97","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Friedrich Kühne","original_name":"Friedrich Kühne","popularity":0.1252,"profile_path":"/s3IZm9oeDPxk6bw9j6v0RY92YO5.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Brabantio","credit_id":"58494a15c3a368140800fa84","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Magnus Stifter","original_name":"Magnus Stifter","popularity":0.0998,"profile_path":"/3R5IWWAdKnPb9S4GTQkUN43j9uu.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Montano","credit_id":"58494a26c3a368140a012c30","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":48057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lya De Putti","original_name":"Lya De Putti","popularity":0.0998,"profile_path":"/lc9XgYy2WifsuXLBL1qoOZjDSaO.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Emilia","credit_id":"58494a3dc3a3681428010c76","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090552,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ludwig Rex","original_name":"Ludwig Rex","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"58494a50c3a368140800faa7","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35407,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dimitri Buchowetzki","original_name":"Dimitri Buchowetzki","popularity":0.213,"profile_path":"/7W2bxOc9HElEtrCwyIsHIMWbsZH.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49259251416c910a4265","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0013469","wikidata_id":"Q14949903","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p9DcVTf9sAYOKtjmMdibPpaGjFn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5bnwbfCbPgclpLe8lyqi9cJoNzx.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1414,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vOeEhZZCOyzc9MvizLnHIFNdjff.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":943}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10181,"name":"based on play or musical"},{"id":10614,"name":"tragedy"},{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"},{"id":242076,"name":"shakespeare's othello"},{"id":332062,"name":"shakespeare"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1922-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1923-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
