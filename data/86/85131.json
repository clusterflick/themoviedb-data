The plot hinges on whether earnest but dim-witted Nemorino will snag Adina, the flirtatious heroine. She's a tease who takes up with Belcore, an army sergeant, to make Nemorino jealous. After numerous (and humorous) plot twists that include a phony love potion, it all ends happily. Adina and Nemorino declare their love for each other, Belcore is dumped, and the fraudulent Dulcamara does a landslide business in love potions. It's all a fast-moving bundle of fun, especially with the star-filled cast of this 2005 Vienna State Opera performance.","popularity":0.2955,"poster_path":"/jawdRvYPb3F2G1WD8j4sos2o20Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1419,"logo_path":null,"name":"Virgin Vision","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2005-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Vienna State Opera performance of L'elisir d'amore by Donizetti","title":"Donizetti: L'elisir d'amore","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":459782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Netrebko","original_name":"Anna Netrebko","popularity":0.9234,"profile_path":"/2SdYMHksZoKwMDllc8C2rhLmXX6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Adina","credit_id":"52fe49269251416c910a4329","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rolando Villazón","original_name":"Rolando Villazón","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":"/x3uFOePgzuazAmt7AERncBLw9zN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Nemorino","credit_id":"52fe49269251416c910a432d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ildebrando d'Arcangelo","original_name":"Ildebrando d'Arcangelo","popularity":0.096,"profile_path":"/s0IZIgj2wNSlTxmDYCbeWTE1jqL.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dulcamara","credit_id":"574b9b589251417ff90004ef","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Nucci","original_name":"Leo Nucci","popularity":0.0575,"profile_path":"/fre6T3D9ba2DwpOz3mxnetRr8JW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Belcore","credit_id":"574b9b73925141362d002cbc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1628424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inna Los","original_name":"Inna Los","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Giannetta","credit_id":"574b9c0dc3a368303b002da3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1628425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred Eschwe","original_name":"Alfred Eschwe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"574b9c409251415f460008f9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2923095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Orchester der Wiener Staatsoper","original_name":"Orchester der Wiener Staatsoper","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff92b720c1255003ef07ddc","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Otto Schenk","original_name":"Otto Schenk","popularity":0.2738,"profile_path":"/9Xw1Sdl6oIKLHsHT4jyJ1lMeF4g.jpg","credit_id":"574b9df79251414af4000c39","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1381395,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gaetano Donizetti","original_name":"Gaetano Donizetti","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/yBbXkriu2TFY9C8E6Scd6OPV9KU.jpg","credit_id":"5e01116975110d0013d8323f","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1377913,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Felice Romani","original_name":"Felice Romani","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/3ADAhIAv7prrxVPzVhPjZdiR65B.jpg","credit_id":"5e0111a7d236e6001691c336","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0996931","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/f0FllcYdgFb7nYDkzJrEi3hOhAS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jawdRvYPb3F2G1WD8j4sos2o20Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2005-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
