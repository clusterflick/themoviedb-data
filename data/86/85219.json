They portray him as their son, extorting money from innocent people by risking the boy's life in staged automobile accidents. Trapped, alone with his captors, and unable to speak for himself, the boy decides to take his fate into his own hands, forever changing the lives of the people around him. Amexica takes a different approach in the exploration of human trafficking, showing the unexpected fallout of human chemistry from the captors and the victim's point of view.","popularity":0.5865,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amexica","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Ferrante","original_name":"Joseph Ferrante","popularity":0.1139,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Man","credit_id":"52fe492c9251416c910a4ed1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":82662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"AnnaLynne McCord","original_name":"AnnaLynne McCord","popularity":0.7561,"profile_path":"/1clytn2mrOWvbUQOvVNJb32v7P.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Woman","credit_id":"52fe492c9251416c910a4ed5","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112340,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ron Krauss","original_name":"Ron Krauss","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe492c9251416c910a4ec1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37334,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Hellerman","original_name":"Paul Hellerman","popularity":0.1021,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe492c9251416c910a4ecd","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112340,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ron Krauss","original_name":"Ron Krauss","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe492c9251416c910a4ec7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112340,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ron Krauss","original_name":"Ron Krauss","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c0dc9cfc3a36825200b4b09","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1249428","wikidata_id":"Q4745960","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
