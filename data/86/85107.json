Continuing his exploration of curious and extraordinary environments, Slow Action applies the idea of island biogeography - the study of how species and eco-systems evolve differently when isolated and surrounded by unsuitable habitat - to a conception of the Earth in a few hundred years; the sea level rising to absurd heights, creating hyperbolic utopias that appear as possible future mini-societies.  This series of constructed realities explores the environments of self-contained lands and the search for information to enable the reconstruction of soon to be lost worlds.","popularity":0.168,"poster_path":"/mtmL6Jg517QyPBl7nOC0hEI7dSE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Slow Action","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932613,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Rivers","original_name":"Ben Rivers","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":"/4WUVJwo0o5nE63xROHGRcSJ7O1T.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49249251416c910a4037","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":932614,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark von Schlegell","original_name":"Mark von Schlegell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49249251416c910a403d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1836918","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":1417,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1d31kvRGfxFJhV6qQiCBweShKPi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2523},{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":1417,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3ZdVepqzxdXwkv1EQT4QWHljv3r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2523},{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":1417,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9lLvCAKdkyS29nSDNytCpkuNPfn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2523}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mtmL6Jg517QyPBl7nOC0hEI7dSE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zk0K6tuvSfz3eTpkbfwLTRoUNqf.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2011-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
