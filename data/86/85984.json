During its two final weeks, Chasen regulars (actors and producers), staff, and management sat for interviews. There's an Oscar party for 1500, footage and photos of famous diners, and time with Tommy Gallagher, the ebullient head waiter until retirement in 1994, his son Patrick, catering head Raymond Bilbool, general manager Ronnie Clint, hat check girl Val Schwab, ladies' room attendant Onetta Johnson, and foreign- born waiters, including Jaime. When he started in 1970, like other Latins, he wasn't allowed out of the kitchen. It's a family farewell.","popularity":2.9819,"poster_path":"/4QSZ1oUfQQvgUcDUlAhJACEGDhw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87977,"logo_path":null,"name":"lobos grande","origin_country":""},{"id":87978,"logo_path":null,"name":"a la carte entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Off the Menu: The Last Days of Chasen's","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sally Kellerman","original_name":"Sally Kellerman","popularity":1.0519,"profile_path":"/dcErCXrb3DWfC9Hw77EifoIlMSY.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58cdd582c3a368510401263d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Landau","original_name":"Martin Landau","popularity":0.9743,"profile_path":"/2BkrH2w5W1lbv8YQQeEHX6mYiEX.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58cdd5979251415a740137ae","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Frost","original_name":"David Frost","popularity":0.2028,"profile_path":"/oWbeL1KLjGjlmNmkmkbea4LxJo0.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58cdd5ae9251415a4501327a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed McMahon","original_name":"Ed McMahon","popularity":0.9606,"profile_path":"/5rSGcD45NL37zBmuCoLJpyfi5Ys.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58cdd5dac3a36850c0010e75","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret O'Brien","original_name":"Margaret O'Brien","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/iLzh8P6N7qKWpVltgBOB7ItBfCu.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58cdd5f2c3a368508c012c8c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suzanne Pleshette","original_name":"Suzanne Pleshette","popularity":1.4077,"profile_path":"/vSuO3CnNkoCefZVTpCARNfJPYhr.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58cdd600c3a36850e90122c3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Rickles","original_name":"Don Rickles","popularity":0.8654,"profile_path":"/iJLQV4dcbTUgxlWJakjDldzlMXS.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58cdd60ac3a36850d70123b4","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharon Stone","original_name":"Sharon Stone","popularity":2.9505,"profile_path":"/5lYs0HaAvsXPZJpMcndbSeQdPgT.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58cdd621c3a3685104012694","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Wagner","original_name":"Robert Wagner","popularity":1.7516,"profile_path":"/dgIN3MrOfX8Q4pzchO58dhMgrFb.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58cdd62d9251415a39013093","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Quentin Tarantino","original_name":"Quentin Tarantino","popularity":3.0128,"profile_path":"/1gjcpAa99FAOWGnrUvHEXXsRs7o.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62e29da7da10f00136c859af","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3151,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Lemmon","original_name":"Jack Lemmon","popularity":0.975,"profile_path":"/7jWVWLr1VJqQrN3d4YJaATCIHRw.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62e29dc1d37197004f84a229","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Leno","original_name":"Jay Leno","popularity":1.0425,"profile_path":"/cplpY6q2VFtR7c1gMHM50wPzdU3.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62e29ddae9da692ced93a3aa","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samuel L.
