The hens, in particular, enjoy their jobs as egg producers. True, a hen gets a bit anxious when her egg is too small or when she can't lay anything. But on the whole, times are good. That changes when a specter by the name of Depression rises from the dump and travels the globe spreading fear and panic. The Great Depression has begun and has poisoned the entire country, including Oswald's farm. Now, the roosters are listless and the chickens flop around in a daze. Oswald runs to the doctor for help. But Dr. Pill points to a poster of the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. \"There's your doctor!\" he declares. Soon, Oswald is in the White House, knocking down the Vice President in his haste to see FDR. Roosevelt sings \"Confidence\" and gives the rabbit a generous supply.","popularity":0.3343,"poster_path":"/1B23YrveO15iNklqxGmWDvvlwcm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":"/x6HLTQILKcImVQ3GvVCwy35W5fz.png","name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1933-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Confidence","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":587950,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"William Nolan","original_name":"William Nolan","popularity":0.1124,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49689251416c910ac4b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78832,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"James Dietrich","original_name":"James Dietrich","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49689251416c910ac4c5","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237588,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tex Avery","original_name":"Tex Avery","popularity":0.5622,"profile_path":"/4jimJwW6FNAxBuM2CD1cZLK6Q5C.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49689251416c910ac4d1","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89284,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walter Lantz","original_name":"Walter Lantz","popularity":0.2364,"profile_path":"/zf5VLzWAmW1mvVMxnMLAJquhric.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49689251416c910ac4bf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932745,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ray Abrams","original_name":"Ray Abrams","popularity":0.0982,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49689251416c910ac4cb","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":932746,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ernest Smythe","original_name":"Ernest Smythe","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49689251416c910ac4dd","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Carr","original_name":"Jack Carr","popularity":0.1783,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5510f195c3a3683f39006a63","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225712,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Cecil Surrey","original_name":"Cecil Surrey","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6460b1d4dbbb4200e22ce8a1","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0142191","wikidata_id":"Q5160073","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1B23YrveO15iNklqxGmWDvvlwcm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1933-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
