Also there is Perry and Della as all three are supporters of the charity. Kate Ford, an assistant with an arrogant attitude, tells David that she is, from now on, going to do an illusion in which an assistant is raised in a glass coffin only to disappear when the coffin is opened up in the air (while the assistant climbs out before the coffin is raised.) After a one night stand with David, Kate is pregnant and she blackmails David with this. David and his wife Judy can't have children so that comes as a double blow to them. However Kate, with her attitude, creates much hatred at her from the rest of the group. At the gala, the glass coffin is raised but when it opens Kate's dead body falls to the ground - strangled.","popularity":3.9504,"poster_path":"/dIpTH0b5HbzWgKN272aixFhLDD9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56689,"logo_path":"/l97Fx8D6qNfrkC50mxVt5ONossk.png","name":"Dean Hargrove Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":56690,"logo_path":"/5cEgzWHzPriA6ZSNaZWkqJqi2UU.png","name":"Fred Silverman Company","origin_country":"US"},{"id":12077,"logo_path":"/s6p5INYKlo6gD6RFXlm9ACA2VVj.png","name":"Viacom Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Perry Mason: The Case of the Glass Coffin","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Perry Mason: el caso del ataud de cristal","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Стеклянный гроб","type":"Alternative Hallmark Title"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Дело о стеклянном гробу","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Perry Mason - Le Cerceuil de verre","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Burr","original_name":"Raymond Burr","popularity":0.8732,"profile_path":"/gsmckogOXPIk6lce2qnNMAFF901.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Perry Mason","credit_id":"52fe495a9251416c910aa8cb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":109701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Hale","original_name":"Barbara Hale","popularity":1.1286,"profile_path":"/xLE53ZfGifU5hNyjoE6z6FsOU01.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Della Street","credit_id":"52fe495a9251416c910aa8cf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William R.
