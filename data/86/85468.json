As Billy Phelps and John McCormick suffer through financial crisis, the loss of their chef, and a crumbling relationship, the filmmakers turn the camera on New York City's legendary restaurateurs who prove that dreams can come true. Billy and John's gamble to open a restaurant together takes shape on Division Street, a unique block in Brooklyn that separates the Satmar Jewish community of Williamsburg from the Latino neighborhood of the South Side. During the course of a year, they convert a former check-cashing shop located under the elevated train tracks of the J/M/Z subway lines into a retro speakeasy. But before the restaurant is fully built they come close to bankruptcy and almost call it quits on their friendship.","popularity":0.7571,"poster_path":"/91vVOoWUSEMGI3VVz52a54pQqUw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130514,"logo_path":"/b4pZZSOipwIRJAvYsoTxfTqdKK0.png","name":"Abstract","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United
