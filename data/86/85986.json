Even unfamiliar with the rules of Mahjong, his gambling intuition is enough to save a small time gambler, Nangou, and grant him a seat at the gambling table. As the night progresses, the stakes are raised both within the game and for Akagi, who is under the suspicion of local police. However, Akagi overcomes the situation with his tactics, defiant of both life and chance. When he leaves the gambling house, no one present is in doubt of his genius.","popularity":0.8922,"poster_path":"/qtue3unAEXTG4Ja1J7oKN7nca0b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12452,"logo_path":"/ydplIEAVaFoVrUVVGWHwHR1TWAG.png","name":"Takeshobo","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1995-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Akagi the Gambler","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Touhaiden Akagi","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":320709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isao Bitō","original_name":"尾藤イサオ","popularity":0.3553,"profile_path":"/lFGynMFXjsNnXY1DcNsHZED2uqR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ac703150e0a26497101e1e3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":235145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takashi Kashiwabara","original_name":"柏原崇","popularity":0.613,"profile_path":"/qkin5JVpWyj90Z4pRh9FtIG7V6K.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ac7033e92514162a401d58d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Minori Terada","original_name":"寺田農","popularity":1.5993,"profile_path":"/sMgy1Gn24zHOyy82ksabfZHaWcv.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64cdbb8b303c8500ade39181","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yutaka Matsushige","original_name":"松重豊","popularity":1.3309,"profile_path":"/wTszXaD9njqahwxmZW74u3C5UE8.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"64cdbb9885090f00e7965bd5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1322813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hiroo Ôtaka","original_name":"大高洋夫","popularity":0.2804,"profile_path":"/poC2y26pCpnF4slnVr7yckpgDj2.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"64cdbba585090f00e7965bdb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shigemitsu Ogi","original_name":"小木茂光","popularity":0.403,"profile_path":"/6p9qTH1TVCbiix1yn22l0T8kS5c.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"64cdbbaf303c850100b0585a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mitsuru Fukikoshi","original_name":"吹越満","popularity":0.6532,"profile_path":"/muIevElNLHwtDeom5BR0Qwif8vI.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"64cdbc2e85090f010690d349","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1047243,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nobuyuki Fukumoto","original_name":"福本伸行","popularity":0.2219,"profile_path":"/vNpfhRUiocVVjsIiUSS0SbyRrq5.jpg","credit_id":"60e350af26dac1004557f740","department":"Writing","job":"Comic Book"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1193900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenzō Maihara","original_name":"舞原賢三","popularity":0.1525,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac702a792514162a801b7ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1047243,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nobuyuki Fukumoto","original_name":"福本伸行","popularity":0.2219,"profile_path":"/vNpfhRUiocVVjsIiUSS0SbyRrq5.jpg","credit_id":"5ac7041ac3a36834e8020ce4","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1924571,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mitsuru Tanabe","original_name":"田辺満","popularity":0.1141,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cdbb6185090f0125bbfe43","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1169263","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":1130,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qtue3unAEXTG4Ja1J7oKN7nca0b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1794,"name":"yakuza"},{"id":13141,"name":"based on manga"},{"id":155633,"name":"mahjong"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
