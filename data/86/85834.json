[It] has been described as being ‘like a comet in the sky of French cinema,’ an ‘unknown masterpiece,’ and an ‘unprecedented’ work that refuses interpretation even as it has provoked reams of critical writing. Its rhythmic collage of images – a girl on a gurney, a fisherman, Greek ruins, a Sicilian garden, a Spanish corrida – is accompanied by an abstract commentary written by Sollers, and only the somber lyricism of Antoine Duhamel’s score holds the film’s elements together. At first viewing, you fear that [it] might fly apart into incoherent fragments. Instead, over the course of its 45 minutes it invents its own rules, and you realize you’re watching something like the filmic channeling of an ancient ritual. – Chris Darke, FILM COMMENT","popularity":0.4401,"poster_path":"/2Rvd3U289UUnnAOcnhupnUPqCHD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":223,"logo_path":"/pdthRbCuXNlrGNwnmLFRxv5Zy3t.png","name":"Les Films du Losange","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1963-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Nothing is certain … in this muted evolution.","title":"Méditerranée","video":false,"vote_average":5.71,"vote_count":31,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Daniel Pollet","original_name":"Jean-Daniel Pollet","popularity":0.1535,"profile_path":"/3eoJoSIgbEG7NbQjs6rk7a6BAQU.jpg","credit_id":"52fe495f9251416c910ab3ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10249,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Volker Schlöndorff","original_name":"Volker Schlöndorff","popularity":0.3518,"profile_path":"/zk29UzKaYdvgY3AQ6KjpQmdNpNf.jpg","credit_id":"634e1e39ca7ec600796541b9","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":25995,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jean-Jacques Rochut","original_name":"Jean-Jacques Rochut","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5ae0309251413f74017a84","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1640780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Sollers","original_name":"Philippe Sollers","popularity":0.0713,"profile_path":"/aoMoQx4KjJrF6WxlFwO2AQPdh6a.jpg","credit_id":"5a5ae004c3a36867de017f3c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23393,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbet Schroeder","original_name":"Barbet Schroeder","popularity":0.5297,"profile_path":"/rwhqq7bmhwc7Wjq0j2KbEZOIJOz.jpg","credit_id":"5a5ae011c3a36867f6015a60","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3529,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antoine Duhamel","original_name":"Antoine Duhamel","popularity":0.0548,"profile_path":"/hvVxYwaaU0TxUCzqh1O3X0HMT3g.jpg","credit_id":"5a5ae01b0e0a267fd3018a3c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Daniel Pollet","original_name":"Jean-Daniel Pollet","popularity":0.1535,"profile_path":"/3eoJoSIgbEG7NbQjs6rk7a6BAQU.jpg","credit_id":"5a5ae0279251413f6e017532","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1160008,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jackie Raynal","original_name":"Jackie Raynal","popularity":0.0671,"profile_path":"/ejNm5oRLHIUguZlZcbosHa5FtMb.jpg","credit_id":"5a5ae03a9251413f6e01753f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1959594,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Claude Lerouge","original_name":"Claude Lerouge","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5ae0469251413f77017e6b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0197719","wikidata_id":"Q3332684","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/123bRGZNuDDuHrRZiIpMEJOuSVk.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2Rvd3U289UUnnAOcnhupnUPqCHD.jpg","vote_average":2.542,"vote_count":4,"width":1067},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/niilxJfs02VMQXosSAphcZgwJkx.jpg","vote_average":2.066,"vote_count":5,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":734,"name":"bullfighting"},{"id":2853,"name":"mediterranean"},{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1963-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Méditerranée (1963) - J.-D.
