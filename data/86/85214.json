Interviews with production staff, including Ridley, give details into the creative process and turmoil during preproduction. Stories from Paul M. Sammon and Fancher provide insight into Philip K. Dick and the origins of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?  Interweaved are cast interviews with the notable exceptions of Harrison Ford and Sean Young. Through these interviews we get a sense of how difficult and frustrating the film was to make as a result of an exacting director without allies and hot, wet, smoggy conditions; which added to the high pressure atmosphere everyone increasingly felt as the film went over budget.  There is also a tour of some locations, most notably the Bradbury Building and the Warner Brothers backlot that was the LA 2019 streets, which look very different from Ridley's dark version.","popularity":1.6223,"poster_path":"/vsbLRM1lqEWEttgjIoTSh533nIG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2000-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Edge of 'Blade Runner'","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":204962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Kermode","original_name":"Mark Kermode","popularity":0.2373,"profile_path":"/ynkrNxzs50tXNGDPpkgO4PUWejS.jpg","cast_id":1002,"character":"Self - Presenter","credit_id":"62f7af84724de10082f4fa74","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9635,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brian Aldiss","original_name":"Brian Aldiss","popularity":0.0841,"profile_path":"/tkrHtRYb2TqBHedzlnzXXpa9PcI.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62f7af95e323f3008ba6ba69","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1116523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Arick","original_name":"Michael Arick","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1004,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62f7af9b6e938a007f63db37","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joanna Cassidy","original_name":"Joanna Cassidy","popularity":2.0397,"profile_path":"/2GZeohandSt32YHEoDEam1uQHcc.jpg","cast_id":1005,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62f7afa1e78687007f12b349","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":581,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Deeley","original_name":"Michael Deeley","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1006,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62f7afa76e938a007a3aea21","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1980734,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"David Dryer","original_name":"David Dryer","popularity":0.1472,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1007,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62f7afb6e323f3008ba6ba7e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hampton Fancher","original_name":"Hampton Fancher","popularity":0.4778,"profile_path":"/7Ocd4Xpd0DHA3ZQxPRu5dUCAFjm.jpg","cast_id":1008,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62f7afbbe267de00928a9fbb","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1889231,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Katherine Haber","original_name":"Katherine Haber","popularity":0.1248,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1009,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62f7afc26e938a007a3aea2e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daryl Hannah","original_name":"Daryl Hannah","popularity":3.6582,"profile_path":"/4LLmp6AQdlj6ueGCRbVRSGvvFSt.jpg","cast_id":1010,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62f7afd3f92532009229b8c2","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rutger Hauer","original_name":"Rutger Hauer","popularity":1.2372,"profile_path":"/3Lly7qwOrESdFcwyaiEOfPlB76l.jpg","cast_id":1011,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62f7afd9596a91007b893b5e","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Hong","original_name":"James Hong","popularity":1.6638,"profile_path":"/v3lfw5aHOy0paOCx6WHiSnwzbH0.jpg","cast_id":1012,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62f7afdf77d23b007ee2ff85","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12867,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Syd Mead","original_name":"Syd Mead","popularity":0.1158,"profile_path":"/xLp9zBAOwrvgQQ55goeIpBJuNyE.jpg","cast_id":1013,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62f7afe577d23b007ee2ff89","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":596,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Lawrence G.
