In the 1980s an intrepid Australian pilot left behind a surfboard in the seaside village of Vanimo. Twenty years on, surfing is not only a pillar of village life but also a means to prestige.

A spot on the Papua New Guinea national surfing team is the way to see the wider world; the only way.","popularity":0.2562,"poster_path":"/h1ARo5QMG3NfILj8Lb8OeKAWVpL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8507,"logo_path":null,"name":"In Effect Films","origin_country":""},{"id":92743,"logo_path":"/nuuoC1PvYX8GunZXP2AIrRoNQ8J.png","name":"Little House Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Splinters","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931969,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Pesce","original_name":"Adam Pesce","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49379251416c910a6625","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931970,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Perrin Chiles","original_name":"Perrin Chiles","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49379251416c910a662b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":931971,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adam Pesce","original_name":"Adam Pesce","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49379251416c910a6631","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":931972,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Catherine Davila","original_name":"Catherine Davila","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49379251416c910a6637","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931973,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Morgan","original_name":"Paul Morgan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49379251416c910a663d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":931974,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charlene Olson","original_name":"Charlene Olson","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49379251416c910a6643","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":931975,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Danielle Robinson","original_name":"Danielle Robinson","popularity":0.0917,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49379251416c910a6649","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":582624,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alan Siegel","original_name":"Alan Siegel","popularity":0.0519,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49379251416c910a664f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931976,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Onnalee Blank","original_name":"Onnalee Blank","popularity":0.1919,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49379251416c910a6655","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1606813,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Benjamin Lindemuth-McRobie","original_name":"Benjamin Lindemuth-McRobie","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5712cbdf92514133670027bf","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1316432","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2208,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h1ARo5QMG3NfILj8Lb8OeKAWVpL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1472}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5349,"name":"surfing"},{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":11836,"name":"contest"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
