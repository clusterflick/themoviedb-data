There is priceless footage of Neal Cassady driving Ken Kesey's bus and of the Dead, surrounded by martini-sipping hipsters, on Playboy After Dark. The best scenes involve band members talking about specific songs (you will never hear Phil Lesh's \"Box of Rain\" again without thinking of it as a gift to his dying father) or deconstructing a tune by playing each track separately. Intimate and surprisingly cohesive, Anthem to Beauty is a rare glimpse into how the Dead's magic was made.","popularity":1.39,"poster_path":"/ibT8qJPgemlz1OYJO4qtUF45LGi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grateful Dead: Anthem to Beauty","video":false,"vote_average":6.417,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Classic Albums: Grateful Dead - Anthem to Beauty","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Garcia","original_name":"Jerry Garcia","popularity":0.1168,"profile_path":"/6jAKLIekOs6FFcc783PZ1pb8soe.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c81045c0e0a2643015e1a16","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Weir","original_name":"Bob Weir","popularity":0.1945,"profile_path":"/4yYZUCBEeptckOHLusV1TEPJDy3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c810463c3a3684e98d578d5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Lesh","original_name":"Phil Lesh","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":"/anwnpAKtVpSm0azesfxouyM6N4N.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c81046fc3a3684e8cd5b00a","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":231538,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Geoff Kempin","original_name":"Geoff Kempin","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea0724ff85958001e7a40ba","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":231540,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Terry Shand","original_name":"Terry Shand","popularity":0.056,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea072d27aecc600257e8997","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":933454,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bous De Jong","original_name":"Bous De Jong","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea072fdf1b571001a8f40c3","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":933455,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nick De Grunwald","original_name":"Nick De Grunwald","popularity":0.089,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea072e97aecc6001f7e6548","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":587855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeremy Marre","original_name":"Jeremy Marre","popularity":0.064,"profile_path":"/x5EB9uwjUgpFElYGIWQRHNRwM1Q.jpg","credit_id":"5ec6facf140bad001d19b036","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0259336","wikidata_id":"Q572308","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8oFuaNMjzilxI3nSbiF8PGo0Edc.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/njJif0Bveps0HEbROoyPfiaptwa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ykwxUQtN2afbphWmVJfQG2Nwnn6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fUxchKputGKkJzPMSWYfcCicwOZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ibT8qJPgemlz1OYJO4qtUF45LGi.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uVv3Jhh2rdtvWUkAQ06y62uz5hv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18001,"name":"rock band"},{"id":281554,"name":"rock"},{"id":320957,"name":"grateful dead"},{"id":341607,"name":"''anthem of the sun''"},{"id":341608,"name":"''american beauty''"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
