In a capillary, blood flows.","popularity":0.1589,"poster_path":"/wnm7c0SBOadnZ29OGApRm4aRtbG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1963-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dog Star Man: Part I","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":47,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Brakhage","original_name":"Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5a2378e4925141032c0c2368","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1013947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Wodening","original_name":"Jane Wodening","popularity":0.0791,"profile_path":"/pWLBcc7Tn3RgUyN8fXGf8YoKmHq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5a2378e9c3a3680b9a0caa15","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Brakhage","original_name":"Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49249251416c910a408f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0058025","wikidata_id":"Q123536955","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8xry52OITdSvgZ4MKYzcWgX3lO.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5XgHZ5lxkxSJOm0XfPJJZKzjjC2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":884,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wnm7c0SBOadnZ29OGApRm4aRtbG.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":589},{"aspect_ratio":0.695,"height":884,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xCEUsoTIGR5jP5vkgRIFLZA3ZbU.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":614}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Bleecker St. Cinema","release_date":"1963-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
