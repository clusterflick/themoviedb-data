In 2006, female inmates were allowed to participate for the first time. In a state with the highest female incarceration rate in the country, these women share common experiences such as broken homes, drug abuse and alienation from their children. Since 1940, the Oklahoma State Penitentiary has held an annual 'Prison Rodeo'. Part Wild West show and part coliseum-esque spectacle, it's one of the last of its kind - a relic of the American penal system. Prisoners compete on wild-broncs and bucking bulls, risking life-long injuries. For inmates like Danny Liles, a 14-year veteran of the rodeo, the chance to battle livestock offers a brief respite from prison life. Within this strange arena the prisoners become the heroes while the public and guards applaud","popularity":0.3625,"poster_path":"/asijXyMcNBfd5ST0hW45IgHmCzf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162169,"logo_path":null,"name":"Roadside Cinema","origin_country":""},{"id":4099,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cactus Three","origin_country":"US"},{"id":14914,"logo_path":"/1RZBWz53SpHUTLpRcM8BGv2plIP.png","name":"HBO Documentary Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-09-17","revenue":4199,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sweethearts of the Prison Rodeo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3261497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danny Liles","original_name":"Danny Liles","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"615e90b8c8a2d4002ac77839","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3261498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamie Brooks","original_name":"Jamie Brooks","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"615e90c51d35630060c174fb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3261499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandy Witte","original_name":"Brandy Witte","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Self","credit_id":"615e90d0245dbe0042ef84ee","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3261500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Crystal Herrington","original_name":"Crystal Herrington","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Self","credit_id":"615e90d869eb90008a466d44","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3261501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monty Baker","original_name":"Monty Baker","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Self","credit_id":"615e90e01d35630060c17509","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3261502,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rhonda Buffalo","original_name":"Rhonda Buffalo","popularity":0.0554,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Self","credit_id":"615e90e867e0f7006303a0c3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3261503,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashley Burris","original_name":"Ashley Burris","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Self","credit_id":"615e90efc8a2d4008c7f8e2e","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bradley Beesley","original_name":"Bradley Beesley","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49499251416c910a8825","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bradley Beesley","original_name":"Bradley Beesley","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615e8fe5899da20042c02b06","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1489948,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James D.
