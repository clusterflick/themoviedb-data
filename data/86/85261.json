It is a story about a formidable and extraordinary woman, a vain eccentric, and a very sensitive human being, whose life was characterized by great ups and downs.\r The documentary takes the viewer on a journey through the author's life as described by many of those who were close to her. A journey that not only documents her extraordinary life, her extensive travels and the people she encountered-but one which also depicts the era in which she lived. A time of adventure, eccentric aristocrats, and of unending possibility and immeasurable hardship.\r Introduced by actress Meryl Streep, Karen Blixen−Out of this World tells the real story behind the inspiration for the Academy Award winning film, Out of Africa.","popularity":0.1922,"poster_path":"/3KefzVwCBisqiui79yA96FIfchR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":235,"logo_path":"/obOynoztBEhDNfHsDXBqOuQLAZk.png","name":"Nordisk Film Denmark","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Karen Blixen: Out of This World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10634,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Karen Blixen","original_name":"Karen Blixen","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/r4S3CttBmJY2zTv5MpTok3tsb9G.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"6115621e87f3f200755cd551","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meryl Streep","original_name":"Meryl Streep","popularity":2.6996,"profile_path":"/g5cVxQBAQ3AXt3LhdBXtbbN47Uc.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self - Host","credit_id":"61156234b686b9005dbe46de","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2644354,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna von Lowzow","original_name":"Anna von Lowzow","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/mI5IqVwac28MdqnFjguZHxdGEci.jpg","credit_id":"611561a087f3f200755cd46d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3195983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcus Mandal","original_name":"Marcus Mandal","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611561da9b6e4700447e706d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3195983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcus Mandal","original_name":"Marcus Mandal","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61156176006b0100469eeef1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1778279","wikidata_id":"Q20494915","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1428,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3KefzVwCBisqiui79yA96FIfchR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
