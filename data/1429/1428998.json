Now, over 40 years later, Janet travels from America to the Middle East to witness something remarkable - how Murray’s ideas have ignited a female-led revolution in North-East Syria, where society is being rebuilt in the wake of victory over ISIS.  Janet meets the women who are turning her late partner’s political theories into a modern reality, creating a grassroots communal democracy. Janet draws what she sees, and her illustrations capture the humanity of ordinary people in their struggle to self-govern. Now, at this critical moment for Syria and with this revolutionary project under renewed threat, \"Threads of a Revolution\" reveals a possible way forward for those prepared to fight for a new way to live.","popularity":0.3191,"poster_path":"/1sfS1qqYHkj5vFav3sCgA8nqysB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":252443,"logo_path":"/rpV3uECgKEqIap2STYNlRcF9kXZ.png","name":"Blue Cuckoo","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":252444,"logo_path":"/qH5waxxzjwmfPm8IPKQnsiShBZP.png","name":"Shadowgraph","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Threads of a Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5225063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janet Biehl","original_name":"Janet Biehl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"self","credit_id":"67a2423d9a24fca660262fa1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2383781,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ross Domoney","original_name":"Ross Domoney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a2425ced829ebc56e2e298","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5225070,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danny Mitchell","original_name":"Danny Mitchell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a2428c80e593d5fde2d5a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d4LbnO1CTykzdsObTK8MFyupmCY.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2400},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/myyNjrhJLCtHlx0DtebBnfkiwjS.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2400},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n8oNmmxNxJaYuRD56Du0MWplE6T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1sfS1qqYHkj5vFav3sCgA8nqysB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":33640,"name":"democracy"},{"id":191111,"name":"syria"},{"id":237170,"name":"rojava"},{"id":296352,"name":"post-war"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"https://www.riocinema.org.uk/movie/kurdish-film-festival-threads-of-a-revolution-short-qa/","release_date":"2025-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
