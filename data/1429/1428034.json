This mostly dialogue-free film, scored by Jean Sibelius’s Symphony No. 1, explores the eastern side of the Helsinki borough divided in two by train tracks. As inhabitants of Itä-Pasila reminisce about everyday life in their beloved part of town, their thoughts are conveyed to the viewer through text on the screen. To some, Itä-Pasila is reminiscent of grey and depressing barracks, but to others the area is a cherished home filled with good memories.","popularity":0.0734,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2025-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Itä-Pasila","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1836538,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anu Pennanen","original_name":"Anu Pennanen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679fbec7a8935914159566b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DocPoint - Helsinki Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2025-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
