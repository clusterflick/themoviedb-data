Director Mikki Noroila’s relative Rimmin Ul’l’aska, who lived in Viena Karelia, served as a living model for Väinämöinen in Gallen-Kallela’s Aino Triptych (1891). The film tells an alternative narrative of history, one that does not rely on the Finnish colonial tradition.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2024-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Tried to Capture Him in the Image But He Disappeared","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3173525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikki Noroila","original_name":"Mikki Noroila","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679fc09c6b609118d1260f42","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
