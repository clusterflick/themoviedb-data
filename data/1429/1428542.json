The film challenges this presumption by portraying two contrasting ways of life through objects and locations, encouraging viewers to think critically about the complexities of what makes a better life. In the Philippines, it's believed that relocating to a new area will bring about positive changes in one's existence. True satisfaction is a complex and multifaceted notion, and \"Bagong Buhay\" encourages us to ponder that relocating to a new place is not a surefire way to attain it.","popularity":0.4852,"poster_path":"/usiX1bRIJaTr5T5ycG32c0bPXTZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2023-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bagong bahay, bagong buhay.
