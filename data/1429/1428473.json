When he ran away and came to the Tottori Sand Dunes, he meets deaf, blind and mute Heren Kera (a Japanese Helen Keller), who lives with a tutor, Saribaba. He is soon caught but becomes invisible man in an accident. However, he is visible to one person: Kera.  The story of the play Tomei Ningen no Yuge (The Kiss of an Invisible Man) is overflowing with diverse motifs, including “Romeo and Juliet,” “The Miracle Worker,” the mythological world in the age of the gods, the River Styx and Hades. It develops further to cover World War II and the Imperial system, and together with skillful language play, a theatrical world unfolds in all directions.","popularity":0.5919,"poster_path":"/vDwC0BF5d5O5apHDJ4mB5wFfpfN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":252559,"logo_path":null,"name":"New National Theatre Tokyo","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2004-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kiss of an Invisible Man","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":72494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rie Miyazawa","original_name":"宮沢りえ","popularity":1.1068,"profile_path":"/wWyTzhbgZZqnNGBJIYzDh8ORFs3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67a0def91742b44a14cb9251","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91870,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sadawo Abe","original_name":"阿部隆史","popularity":0.7811,"profile_path":"/1kafRXtKloIamrHhgsoSfhsbIp9.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67a0df07176fdb2244cbab22","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1180893,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hideki Noda","original_name":"野田秀樹","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/s43K3Bdb3urhYIdLPvnhXwQjybc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67a0df1150f5d47625263e12","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toru Tezuka","original_name":"手塚とおる","popularity":0.3467,"profile_path":"/pTh4Dc2qqdzRLYaWXEUQZp8bScA.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67a0df20176fdb2244cbab38","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1134609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natsuko Akiyama","original_name":"秋山菜津子","popularity":0.3582,"profile_path":"/sKSqvYRxqw8JFflLIjvNIRWqeT2.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67a0df2a50f5d47625263e17","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1204321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yumiko Takahashi","original_name":"高橋由美子","popularity":0.4404,"profile_path":"/kwKzOXuuWL8cPNrAxCLknpSu4eo.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67a0df3450f5d47625263e2b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoshiki Arizono","original_name":"有薗芳記","popularity":0.2064,"profile_path":"/tMRhthWxsxP5LS8i6UHn9ATJQk2.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67a0df3f428fcc4a529534d5","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Osawa","original_name":"大沢健","popularity":0.269,"profile_path":"/ssUrIBlXVaklpc0XVTH6kuf4OvF.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67a0df476b609118d1262a78","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naomasa Musaka","original_name":"六平直政","popularity":0.4575,"profile_path":"/cEQZWsUd9Es3pLR8rMF5PqOiGpy.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"67a0df660d19f30ac1959c3b","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5228143,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yukio Takatsu","original_name":"Yukio Takatsu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a3ea582f44f82ad32fbc80","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1180893,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hideki Noda","original_name":"野田秀樹","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/s43K3Bdb3urhYIdLPvnhXwQjybc.jpg","credit_id":"67a3eaf88dbb4c099066cc36","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dkFk29WCUnlNgYDzr8eRIaZFCyQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vDwC0BF5d5O5apHDJ4mB5wFfpfN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":195729,"name":"stage play"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2004-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
