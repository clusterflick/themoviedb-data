From the Pride Parade and LGBT baby showers to intimate dinners with friends, Jill has been documenting the many celebrations of community that flourish in Asbury Park, New Jersey. Jill and her wife, Susan, are surrounded by a community that gives—and gives—and also takes care of its own. Years of background footage are mixed with love stories that introduce all of the people in love, as well as the vibrant LGBT businesses, music, art, and community that are the fabric of Asbury Park. Known for its art, music, and strong LGBT presence, Asbury Park is home to lesbians, gays, and trans couples who are having babies and living their lives. We all support each other. This film captures the events and lives that are surrounded by love.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/wmadbd5c94BZY1KV7PoJUrVjt4r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pride of Asbury","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1997747,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jill Salvino","original_name":"Jill Salvino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679fc27b6b609118d126100f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1997747,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jill Salvino","original_name":"Jill Salvino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679fc282ac5a7951b9cb7172","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35052996","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wmadbd5c94BZY1KV7PoJUrVjt4r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
