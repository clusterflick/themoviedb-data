Great breakfasts, comfy beds, long walks on the beach. There's just one little problem: her B and B is haunted by the ghost of her long-dead ancestor, Marcus Gregory. In real life, Marcus liked to spank: nothing has changed even though he's been dead 200 years. Marcus loves to set up situations where Maggie's female guests find themselves inexplicably over the knees of their husbands, much to Maggie's consternation.  Then one day a new guest shows up - one that can also see Captain Gregory. How is that possible?! And what consequences will this have for Maggie, the Captain, and Juliana.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/u0rkk89Iv2IC1fwCDQHCu9zsJ4y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97304,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wasteland Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ghost and Maggie Moore","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5221062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angelique La Claire","original_name":"Angelique La Claire","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"679ff26f0d19f30ac1957cde","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5221063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Godiva","original_name":"Godiva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"679ff27b0d19f30ac1957ced","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5221064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maggie Steward","original_name":"Maggie Steward","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"679ff28304cb6f41b9cb7647","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5221066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renee Evans","original_name":"Renee Evans","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"679ff2a20d19f30ac1957cfb","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":4417645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Orthodox Celts","original_name":"Orthodox Celts","popularity":0.001,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"679ff2b7ac5a7951b9cb7ab2","order":4},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5221068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Pierson","original_name":"David Pierson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"679ff2c150f5d47625262656","order":5},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5221069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Martin","original_name":"Paul Martin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"679ff2cbac5a7951b9cb7ac8","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1923010,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Colin Rowntree","original_name":"Colin Rowntree","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679ff25628bb97ddd39579ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1410,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/u0rkk89Iv2IC1fwCDQHCu9zsJ4y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":940}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
