At dawn on October 7, 2023, Israel and the entire region were confronted with a sudden, complex, and large-scale military operation that shifted the balance of power in the Middle East. To this day, thousands of fighters from the Al-Qassam Brigades managed to cross the fence that separated the Gaza Strip from the outside world—in an operation they called Al-Aqsa Flood. The Flood presents exclusive footage from that day, including films and documents being revealed for the first time since the start of the war, as well as some interviews conducted for the first time.","popularity":0.0388,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":62165,"logo_path":"/9i15HMPXjW657H4BnrMkeQcbktL.png","name":"Al Jazeera","origin_country":"QA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"}],"release_date":"2025-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What is Hidden is Greater","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"QA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"2025-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
