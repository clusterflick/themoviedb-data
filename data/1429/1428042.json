The changing of the seasons and Helsinki’s familiar streets can look very different coloured by a constant worry over your future, fate, and survival. Street writer Janne gives a diary-like account of his experiences, some of them dark and even brutal. The images captured on 16mm film by director Antti Lempiäinen make the experience palpable. And yet, there is a comforting and hopeful undertone to the film: a better life is possible.","popularity":0.0297,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2025-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rooms","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2935954,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antti Lempiäinen","original_name":"Antti Lempiäinen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679fc12ea74d8ee23b265625","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DocPoint - Helsinki Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2025-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
