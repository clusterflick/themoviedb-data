At 82, Larry is a man consumed by obsession, his encyclopedic knowledge and unrelenting passion for muskie fishing having cost him dearly: three marriages, lifelong friendships, and his place among the very people who once revered him. Set against the icy, unforgiving waters of the St. Lawrence River, Muskie Man follows Larry as he prepares for one last hunt to claim the fish of a lifetime. As he navigates the physical toll of his age and the emotional weight of his exile, the film explores the fragile balance between obsession and isolation.","popularity":0.0956,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Muskie Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5223147,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Delmonte","original_name":"Michael Delmonte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a149942505cac8e002ed27","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5223149,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jackie Pal","original_name":"Jackie Pal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a149a22505cac8e002ed3e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-01-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
