When one of them is suddenly accused of having masturbated in his friend's bathroom, what starts as a McCarthy-era trial of accusations at one individual suddenly escalates into a night of judgment that tests the truth of their words and the strength of all their friendships. LIONS' DEN is an entirely improvised drama using both actors and non actors shot over the course of an evening, based from a loose outline. It ultimately is a probing of the way men behave with one another. It also emphasizes the way people point the finger at others to hide their own sins and actions. A melting pot of lies, truths, egos, and masculinity that is stirred with documentary-style filmmaking.","popularity":0.0737,"poster_path":"/vrbiwbdSTEkgiCruPb0k4NSfEI9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lions' Den","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4723916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Buck","original_name":"Matthew Buck","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":"/vFeTPwjKO4QZNh4JBEMwp1k45h5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Matthew","credit_id":"67a17ae16b9f666a9902fa73","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1380516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gideon Seaman","original_name":"Gideon Seaman","popularity":0.2915,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Gideon","credit_id":"67a17ae97ebb0614ff26abc0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4677217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Hunter","original_name":"Aaron Hunter","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Aaron","credit_id":"67a17aef7ebb0614ff26abc7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1402087,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robby Storey","original_name":"Robby Storey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Robby","credit_id":"67a17afda45287b7fde2c478","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1162439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Mosley","original_name":"Frank Mosley","popularity":0.0916,"profile_path":"/4V3otUE2lktA6wyooya7QluisxU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Frank","credit_id":"67a17b10a45287b7fde2c488","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5223464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Drew Kondraske","original_name":"Drew Kondraske","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Drew","credit_id":"67a17b1c6b9f666a9902faa1","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1162439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Mosley","original_name":"Frank Mosley","popularity":0.0916,"profile_path":"/4V3otUE2lktA6wyooya7QluisxU.jpg","credit_id":"67a17b29ed829ebc56e2be20","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4625284,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonny Cruz","original_name":"Jonny Cruz","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a17b79a45287b7fde2c4b3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1162439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Mosley","original_name":"Frank Mosley","popularity":0.0916,"profile_path":"/4V3otUE2lktA6wyooya7QluisxU.jpg","credit_id":"67a17b83a45287b7fde2c4b9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1402087,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robby Storey","original_name":"Robby Storey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a17b97a74d8ee23b26ac9a","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1162439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Mosley","original_name":"Frank Mosley","popularity":0.0916,"profile_path":"/4V3otUE2lktA6wyooya7QluisxU.jpg","credit_id":"67a180fa7ebb0614ff26ad84","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1095472","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/35em8TbJy8SvpBjGS5hvjJcCEtn.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2560},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kMBDYfmAWpktxWz5U0jJYl6qWT7.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2560},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lHx98khX4yH744Dq64P2o2AkeQt.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2560}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1499,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vrbiwbdSTEkgiCruPb0k4NSfEI9.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Dallas Video Festival","release_date":"2007-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"lions' den (2007)","key":"16079094","site":"Vimeo","size":720,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2010-10-22T02:32:10.000Z","id":"67a17bd6ed829ebc56e2be65"}]}}}
