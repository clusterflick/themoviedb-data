As the charity enters its second year on the farm in 2024, the film charts its dramatic challenges, makes remarkable discoveries and camera traps reveal some astounding new species arrivals, demonstrating that when you give nature space, it really can begin to bounce back. With England languishing in the bottom 3% of the most nature-depleted countries on Earth, the challenge to restore its biodiversity and kickstart nature recovery has never been more urgent. This film offers hope for the positive change the rewilding movement can bring.","popularity":0.256,"poster_path":"/33bEpIuYlkxuD0gAx09Fazp9UOI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heal the Land","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1346763,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hayley Smith","original_name":"Hayley Smith","popularity":0.0558,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a147eb7ebb0614ff26a2c6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1346763,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hayley Smith","original_name":"Hayley Smith","popularity":0.0558,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a147f7716bfd74ece2bd3e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5223141,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tom Francome","original_name":"Tom Francome","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a148056b9f666a9902f2b2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/33bEpIuYlkxuD0gAx09Fazp9UOI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":564}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
