Through the voices of a NASA scientist, a Florida fishing captain, and medical professionals, the film delves into the devastating impacts of red tides on coastal communities, the economy, and marine life. With new groundbreaking satellite technology, NASA and the scientific community work to better understand and mitigate these destructive phenomena. The PACE (Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem) mission extends and expands NASA’s long-term observations of our living planet from space, taking the Earth’s pulse in new ways. As time unfolds, the need for global awareness and action is essential to protect our oceans, as solutions lie not only in viewing our planet from space but also in our collective responsibility to safeguard the planet’s fragile ecosystems.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/c5lLmepqjxU8LLFEPHuxLXLpIj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Ocean in Bloom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5223083,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emme Watkins","original_name":"Emme Watkins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a13d712505cac8e002ec33","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5223083,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emme Watkins","original_name":"Emme Watkins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a13d7e6b609118d1264dc5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c5lLmepqjxU8LLFEPHuxLXLpIj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-08-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
