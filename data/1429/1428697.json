The workers went home and the fairy tale began. Screws and nuts, hammer and plane, chisel and screwdriver came to life. \"We've done a good job, and now we can have some fun!\" said the hammer. The details made such a noise that Samodelkin, who was flying on his all-terrain vehicle, heard it. He offered to arrange a concert and make musical instruments. The work started and finally everything is ready. A fun concert took place and no machinations of defective parts could prevent success.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":186508,"logo_path":"/dONUQvMFW5X8DCw6nX9Dk26TQwF.png","name":"Georgia-Film","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1959-01-08","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"After the Whistle Blows","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Sakviris shemdeg","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2898282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vakhtang Bakhtadze","original_name":"ვახტანგ ბახტაძე","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a164d26b9f666a9902f53f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1905328,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sara Sparsiashvili","original_name":"სარა სპარსიაშვილი","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a164dda45287b7fde2bfab","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2898282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vakhtang Bakhtadze","original_name":"ვახტანგ ბახტაძე","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a164ed7ebb0614ff26a90e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1489459,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sulchan Nassidse","original_name":"სულხან ნასიძე","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a164f8605fa0d50002f99d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5094165,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"A.
