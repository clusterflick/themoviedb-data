The film features six people who have challenged gender stereotypes to find meaningful work, including a carpenter-turned-beekeeper, a stay-at-home dad, a  highland cattle breeder, a flower farmer, an auto body technician, and an early childhood educator. Following them through their work day, the film explores the tenuous balancing act between self-satisfaction through career, nurturing others, and contribution to the greater good.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Good Hands","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
