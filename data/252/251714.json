At its heart, a feisty but feminine Rosalind (Naomi Frederick), in love with the endearingly na√Øve Orlando (Jack Laskey), uses her disguise as Ganymede to counsel him playfully in the art of wooing. Distraction is provided by Dominic Rowan, a remarkably funny Touchstone, and Tim McMullan, whose sonorous tones are perfectly suited to the lugubrious wit of Jaques. Filmed in High Definition and true surround sound.","popularity":1.2205,"poster_path":"/ub20VvZ8vcD22tcjBaVNqhbMSVm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21276,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shakespeare's
