Most of the material is filmed by the characters themselves, who worked with the filmâ€™s directors in a process of collaboration and mentorship over a course of two years. The four main characters find creative ways to express what is hidden within their hearts: speaking of their dreams and desires in an extraordinarily open and intimate way, and using metaphors, and cinematic storytelling to transform the every-day struggles of their lives into the sublime. Set in the overwhelming chaos of Cairo, the film also oscillates back and forth between an empty and abstract desert, which might be real or unreal.","popularity":0.0687,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ana Ana","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1021439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Petr Lom","original_name":"Petr Lom","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e209251416c91127509","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287048,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Corinne van Egeraat","original_name":"Corinne van Egeraat","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e209251416c9112750f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1021439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Petr Lom","original_name":"Petr Lom","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e209251416c91127515","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287048,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Corinne van Egeraat","original_name":"Corinne van Egeraat","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e209251416c9112751b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3387138","wikidata_id":"Q28734804","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
