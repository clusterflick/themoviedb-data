Among those exiles were a number of writers and poets, including Yannis Ritsos and Tassos Livaditis. Despite the deprivation and torture, they managed to write poems which describe the struggle for survival in this world of internment. These texts, some of them buried in the camps, were later found. «Like Lions of stone at the gateway of night» blends these poetic writings with the reeducation propaganda speeches constantly piped through the camps’ loudspeakers. Long tracking shots take us on a trance-like journey through the camp ruins, interrupted along the way by segments from photographic archives. A cinematic essay, which revives the memory of forgotten ruins and a battle lost.","popularity":0.2826,"poster_path":"/e5dfbvYJgwXpj6C06tNGvWaLzUv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111106,"logo_path":null,"name":"Periplus","origin_country":""},{"id":13668,"logo_path":"/azhapBvZ8g1UWyyQQhhcRR9bM9x.png","name":"RTS","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":177804,"logo_path":null,"name":"Audiovisuel Multimedia International Production (AMIP)","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":95504,"logo_path":null,"name":"Prince Film","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2012-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Like Stone Lions in the Gateway into Night","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Claude Dauphin","original_name":"Jean-Claude Dauphin","popularity":0.2487,"profile_path":"/4PoPWNcJeLrkokpnCMZxfIDjMSS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (French voice)","credit_id":"52fe4e0d9251416c91124e63","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1267500,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier Zuchuat","original_name":"Olivier Zuchuat","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e0d9251416c91124e5f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1267500,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier Zuchuat","original_name":"Olivier Zuchuat","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63285eeedcb6a3007dda0155","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1295255,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Denis Séchaud","original_name":"Denis Séchaud","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/whhcxP5esvo88FM80QT6qgvK2eR.jpg","credit_id":"63285f6943250f007e8c078b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37640,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vincent Montrobert","original_name":"Vincent Montrobert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63285f4bd7a70a007c79a59b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1267500,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier Zuchuat","original_name":"Olivier Zuchuat","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63285efdb18f32007b7c2a81","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1373898,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aris Athanasopoulos","original_name":"Άρης Αθανασόπουλος","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":"/2vk0o37UJc2cQFbXBJw6ifbHSBq.jpg","credit_id":"63285f2bbc2cb30083348918","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2248723","wikidata_id":"Q6547144","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qoKwLCRwxMMsFCZbIz9RJZGOEu0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2559,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/e5dfbvYJgwXpj6C06tNGvWaLzUv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1706}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":393,"name":"civil war"},{"id":1631,"name":"concentration camp"},{"id":1200,"name":"greece"},{"id":173644,"name":"communism"},{"id":303226,"name":"artfilm"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
