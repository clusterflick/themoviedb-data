Free climbing originated in Eastern Europe, but has recently spread to Britain.  James Kingston is a 23-year-old who lives with his mother near Southampton. In his spare time James scales the local 100m cranes and 200m radio towers.  Now James embarks on a journey to the spiritual home of urban free climbing, Ukraine, where he teams up with the infamous Mustang Wanted, the craziest climber of them all.  As Mustang and James explore Kiev, the pair push themselves to new extremes, climbing derelict buildings and tightrope-walking hundreds of metres above the city, before finally heading to the iconic Moscow bridge to attempt Mustang's latest death defying stunt.  Don't Look Down is fascinating, revealing and nerve-wracking.","popularity":0.4221,"poster_path":"/ce17sbqxKK3d5AmZlilWbyUhQdr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12709,"logo_path":"/f53sVugHrIjRSXJNxZHywmBSKkR.png","name":"Firecracker Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don't Look Down","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Kingston","original_name":"James Kingston","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4e1f9251416c91127389","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mustang Wanted","original_name":"Mustang Wanted","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4e1f9251416c9112738d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":964758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morgan Roberts","original_name":"Morgan Roberts","popularity":0.1377,"profile_path":"/a7qp3j9jp9athlwlvLQNXmxudAH.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e1f9251416c9112739f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287025,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alex Stockley","original_name":"Alex Stockley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e1f9251416c91127399","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287031,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Seth Hopewell","original_name":"Seth Hopewell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e1f9251416c911273ab","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287032,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Deborah Lasky","original_name":"Deborah Lasky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e1f9251416c911273b1","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287029,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jes Wilkins","original_name":"Jes Wilkins","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e1f9251416c911273a5","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287034,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nina Earl-Gray","original_name":"Nina Earl-Gray","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e1f9251416c911273b7","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1113221,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alex Stockley von Statzer","original_name":"Alex Stockley von Statzer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5acc08750e0a2631f701efad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3478594","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mF5v6g1HMizQnuzSWfrx1rjmiUk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.758,"height":1319,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ce17sbqxKK3d5AmZlilWbyUhQdr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":2006,"name":"extreme sports"},{"id":197623,"name":"free climbing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Don't Look Down | Sunday, 9pm | Channel 4","key":"AYmOsout8lc","published_at":"2014-01-13T14:28:10.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"533ec729c3a368544800bbf4"}]}}}
