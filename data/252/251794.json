The litany of trouble these poor grunts endured is lamentable. One complains of returning home an invalid. An SS man has bad dreams about the Russian tank-driver he killed. Another complains when he sits down to hear a piano recital and one of the musicians has frozen fingers. Another soldier swears he will never forgive his father for injuries he suffered in the invasion of Leningrad. Stock footage of wars from World War II to Vietnam are inserted and give an ironic tinge to the feature.","popularity":0.2133,"poster_path":"/ebCgSkSE2sxPUigwOugaLuabpxQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1969-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lettres de Stalingrad","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Briefe aus Stalingrad (1969)","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Briefe aus Stalingrad","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74697,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Cavalcanti","original_name":"Alberto Cavalcanti","popularity":0.1964,"profile_path":"/wb9sB74uuEkc5mo5hALCzAG7HgT.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Astronomer","credit_id":"52fe4e249251416c91127ce9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Cellier","original_name":"James Cellier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Private","credit_id":"52fe4e249251416c91127ced","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Crauchet","original_name":"Paul Crauchet","popularity":0.138,"profile_path":"/z7ZT4vyrxaVDC5e9Xx8GBx3Nfj4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Pianist","credit_id":"52fe4e249251416c91127cf1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287140,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gilles Katz","original_name":"Gilles Katz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"SS captain","credit_id":"54cb7944925141561e010b20","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":37141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Tabard","original_name":"Pierre Tabard","popularity":0.1136,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Kurt Hankka","credit_id":"661d80750102c901860751a8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4654755,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Saint-Georges","original_name":"Patricia Saint-Georges","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Karl's wife","credit_id":"661d807e4ca67601641c47ed","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":40582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frédérique Meininger","original_name":"Frédérique Meininger","popularity":0.1747,"profile_path":"/kf09hWL33Z1wn7bv7FWTy7V4ScI.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Nurse","credit_id":"661d8093389da101493596bd","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gilles Ségal","original_name":"Gilles Ségal","popularity":0.1243,"profile_path":"/tArXQfwtXT903QdRG2I6FEWuk7T.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Paul","credit_id":"661d80a9db8a0001827e5c2d","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287140,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gilles Katz","original_name":"Gilles Katz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e249251416c91127cfb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287140,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gilles Katz","original_name":"Gilles Katz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bcc203fa404600c129089a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":36522,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chantal Delattre","original_name":"Chantal Delattre","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bcc20afc31d300a8defe7a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3446856,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gérard Brissaud","original_name":"Gérard Brissaud","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bcc210fc31d300c59d4a0c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0064585","wikidata_id":"Q8879631","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/ebCgSkSE2sxPUigwOugaLuabpxQ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zVhFfg0ZmPrrlzmGxEuPreuKmYG.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Milan","release_date":"1972-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
