He somehow manages to survive with a help of women. He doesn't believe in anybody, respects no one and is in constant conflict with the ruling system and order. After being left by a silly American girl, Tom binds with a woman whose husband is abroad. When she kicks him out, he moves in with her husband's sister, who later kills him in the attack of jealousy. All this is shown in the context of major historical events prior to 1968. with lots of archive footage of world leaders.","popularity":0.5427,"poster_path":"/24oy1Uzxbrj0FoovlpMKrLPx2XW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15165,"logo_path":null,"name":"Centar film","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Serbo-Croatian","iso_639_1":"sh","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plastic Jesus","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","title":"Plastični Isus","type":"Serbian Latin"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1311814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomislav Gotovac","original_name":"Tomislav Gotovac","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Tom","credit_id":"58ff2e5ac3a3685331007121","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1803445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vukica Đilas","original_name":"Vukica Đilas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"58ff2e6b925141080b0075f3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1803446,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Svetlana Gligorijević","original_name":"Svetlana Gligorijević","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"58ff2e75c3a36852ed006fbb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1244891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ljubiša Ristić","original_name":"Ljubiša Ristić","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/7i99TdYBKGeU6DXb5ZpPgipZLoC.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"58ff2e7f92514107db00773c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1532488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milorad 'Mida' Stevanović","original_name":"Milorad 'Mida' Stevanović","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"58ff2e86c3a36852ed006fc7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolf Hitler","original_name":"Adolf Hitler","popularity":0.7926,"profile_path":"/n6f81IUSes1a8jTzUIF7rJ5zZnP.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"58ff2e9cc3a36852ed006fd6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1803447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ante Pavelić","original_name":"Ante Pavelić","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"58ff2ea9c3a36852ed006fdf","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1248913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josip Broz Tito","original_name":"Josip Broz Tito","popularity":0.7042,"profile_path":"/fXXtFGdvsMWGRScqTLoQOHED4FN.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"58ff2eb092514107db00774c","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1050833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lazar Stojanović","original_name":"Lazar Stojanović","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e0f9251416c911252a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1136714,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Branko Perak","original_name":"Branko Perak","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"570f05cbc3a368536d001ae4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0067585","wikidata_id":"Q12757340","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f1GYiaAjy4sQWSt915x9ksSAEAL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/DC3HmR7ItA3JeEOCX42lN73Aaw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/24oy1Uzxbrj0FoovlpMKrLPx2XW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8EOQVPG8N6KQpJhfiGIPwrshaJu.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":669},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8pXkX2JuQ4H8U9QcCyg416z4D8N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1755,"name":"fascism"},{"id":7507,"name":"collage"},{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"},{"id":173644,"name":"communism"},{"id":178712,"name":"totalitarianism"},{"id":217807,"name":"street performer"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
