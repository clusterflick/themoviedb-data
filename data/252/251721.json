Playing out like the Twilight Zone or a \"Tales From...\" with plenty of black humor in the mix, they're all actually pretty interesting and quite well-made considering the small budgets I imagine the filmmakers were working with.","popularity":0.3367,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":69377,"logo_path":null,"name":"Platinum
