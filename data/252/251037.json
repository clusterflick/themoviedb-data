He has built his own subsistence conditions. He often goes to the neighboring villages, although he doesn’t communicate with other people. He collects some waste but doesn’t beg. He prowls about the ruins of deserted villages, as an animal or as a ghost. Under double political and economical pressure, most of people are depriving of their last dignity into a world where it exists a lack of material and spirit. But a human being stays a human being. He is looking for reasons to continue to live. —Wang Bing","popularity":0.3074,"poster_path":"/9IvQGk7BybNlwQcpYkEQi0goKlV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82956,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wang Bing Film Workshop","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2010-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Man With No Name","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":15,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"Wu ming zhe","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":933088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wang Bing","original_name":"王兵","popularity":0.733,"profile_path":"/h7VnG6T1HYSBBOAuhy7tYAtawO6.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e079251416c911241cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":933088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wang Bing","original_name":"王兵","popularity":0.733,"profile_path":"/h7VnG6T1HYSBBOAuhy7tYAtawO6.jpg","credit_id":"62d4ea94fa40460055acf2ef","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":933088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wang Bing","original_name":"王兵","popularity":0.733,"profile_path":"/h7VnG6T1HYSBBOAuhy7tYAtawO6.jpg","credit_id":"62d4ea9ce6d3cc004dfb4c90","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1945552,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lü Songye","original_name":"Lü Songye","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d4eaa51f3e60004b9005ed","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2002558,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Fu Kang","original_name":"Fu Kang","popularity":0.0619,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d4eabf1cc4ff00541dd683","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1983579,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Louise Prince","original_name":"Louise Prince","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d4eae51f3e60004b90061d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":939107,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kong Lihong","original_name":"Kong Lihong","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d4eacc5aba320067c1a179","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1802198","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.695,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9IvQGk7BybNlwQcpYkEQi0goKlV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":834}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Saint-Denis Film Festival","release_date":"2010-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
