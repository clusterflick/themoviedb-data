In HACKS, the Austrian multimedia artist Christine Bader examines who is the computer hacker and what moves him or her. Is the hacker a Robin Hood in cyber space or an anarchistic agitator? Bader speaks with Dutch, German and American communication freaks who are working with various kinds of network issues, like making the Internet accessible to individual persons (Felipe Rodriguez, founder of Internet provider Xs4all), creating a meeting place in cyber space, or designing an ultramodern communication network on a ‘multimedia art ship‘. ‘Hackers are not encumbered by technical, financial or organizational problems, they just want to do things‘, Rodriguez thinks. That the technological means ‘just to do things‘ are now freely available is demonstrated by the numerous computer initiatives that whiz past in HACKS.","popularity":0.3926,"poster_path":"/fTuIz1JFAGuUXp8kNMu6lZFeSad.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hacks","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1287184,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ulla Barthold","original_name":"Ulla Barthold","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e269251416c911281bf","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287193,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Graham Whitehead","original_name":"Graham Whitehead","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e269251416c911281fb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287190,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Peter Ott","original_name":"Peter Ott","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e269251416c911281e9","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287191,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dorothea Carl","original_name":"Dorothea Carl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e269251416c911281ef","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Intern"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287188,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Andreas Kunzmann","original_name":"Andreas Kunzmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e269251416c91128207","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287186,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christine Bader","original_name":"Christine Bader","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e269251416c9112820d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287185,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gabi Schwark","original_name":"Gabi Schwark","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e269251416c911281cb","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287186,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christine Bader","original_name":"Christine Bader","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e269251416c911281d1","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287192,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Reinhard Beets","original_name":"Reinhard Beets","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e269251416c911281f5","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Intern"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287188,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Andreas Kunzmann","original_name":"Andreas Kunzmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e269251416c911281dd","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287189,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jin Choi","original_name":"Jin Choi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e269251416c911281e3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287194,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jenny Krug","original_name":"Jenny Krug","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e269251416c91128201","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":35655,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bella Halben","original_name":"Bella Halben","popularity":0.0635,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"538cf3ba0e0a26670800513a","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57807,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michael Thaler","original_name":"Michael Thaler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5767048dc3a36850c400040b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0210090","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fTuIz1JFAGuUXp8kNMu6lZFeSad.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2157,"name":"hacker"},{"id":12361,"name":"hacking"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
