Descendents of the tribe who inherit the psychic powers are given an ancient book to read and pass on. Every 32 years, in connection with the orbiting of the star Sirius B, Ogo returns to kill a few more of the psychics in his ongoing bid for power.","popularity":0.8908,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gifted","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1228749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bianca Taylor","original_name":"Bianca Taylor","popularity":0.2204,"profile_path":"/paSekmSLpFqx2xvrG2S8w8s9bc2.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Lisa","credit_id":"67650f6403a3aa533090c856","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Anthony Williams","original_name":"Dick Anthony Williams","popularity":0.3825,"profile_path":"/j2QHvbxwMa5don7IieIwZyBsIS1.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Daniel","credit_id":"5a06dafdc3a368791400f400","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1921567,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Lewis","original_name":"Aaron Lewis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Aaron","credit_id":"5a06db24c3a36878bd00fddd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":152628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Cambridge","original_name":"Ed Cambridge","popularity":0.1566,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Deacon Jones","credit_id":"5a06db7d92514113fa00f531","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1921569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julie Hampton","original_name":"Julie Hampton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Elsie","credit_id":"5a06dbabc3a36878bd00feef","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Davis Roberts","original_name":"Davis Roberts","popularity":0.1648,"profile_path":"/xYCcqDUEEK8dygv21W36AI0FYDI.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mr. Walker","credit_id":"5a06dbd8c3a368790000ecf5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1921570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Peaston","original_name":"David Peaston","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Church Singer","credit_id":"5a06dc2e92514113ec00ee03","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Sekka","original_name":"Johnny Sekka","popularity":0.2272,"profile_path":"/7xw0r6TFzQn9Hifwe9fQGTag9EU.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"King","credit_id":"5a06ea6792514113fa010d6e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julius Harris","original_name":"Julius Harris","popularity":0.478,"profile_path":"/vp2RGqbmpOspASIQKF7u1RdWZcx.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Pa","credit_id":"5a13b3d4c3a36822630009d9","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1352413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.A.
