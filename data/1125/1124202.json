With the help of local rangers and 15 cameras set up in the Bohemian forest, we are able to track the lynxes and observe their every move â€“ such as a hunt during night, or even the intimate hours during mating season. For the lynx, the environment around them is used to their advantage, like the long grass to sneak on prey, or even using the trees to sharpen their claws. With an arsenal of skills at their disposal, the lynx is an exceptional hunter. Come with us as we see these skills in action!","popularity":0.0611,"poster_path":"/tTVjdA5CrzqkOtnQWL1hyHCV0Ha.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115609,"logo_path":"/k4N9VeUWiOv0I5wr1hHy5JKbjNM.png","name":"Autentic","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":149712,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tesche-Dokumentarfilm","origin_country":""},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The characteristic tufts of hair on their ears make the lynx one of the most recognizable felines in the animal kingdom.","title":"Lynx - Close Up","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1300206,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sigurd Tesche","original_name":"Sigurd Tesche","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645985753fe16000fecf35a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wurpcAfwFbv9JCOFanN4O5FRovt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tTVjdA5CrzqkOtnQWL1hyHCV0Ha.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
