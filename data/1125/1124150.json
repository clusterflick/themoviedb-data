Not Quite That is an intimate and insightful exploration of how we are seen, how we see ourselves, and why it matters.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/skq0JjpyKgdBo3Y40COjZd1uOIB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2023-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Who would you be if you could just be yourself?","title":"Not Quite That","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4052139,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ali Grant","original_name":"Ali Grant","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64596cbc1b70ae0145edb506","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27806593","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"@notquitethatdocumentary","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j77dCoyBVxJNmL42gg4jz25S2hk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/skq0JjpyKgdBo3Y40COjZd1uOIB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Seattle Queer Film Festival 2023: NOT QUITE THAT Official Trailer","key":"L4wEdj4m-WI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-09-12T21:53:55.000Z","id":"65eced4e447f9c01875f3b4f"}]}}}
