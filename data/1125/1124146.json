Van Winkle Part 3","overview":"Judith Gardiner is the last descendant of Rip Van Winkle, the legendary Dutch settler famous for sleeping his life away. But what people don't know is that he also was a serial killer. Now Judith is subject to amnesiac blackouts in which she re-enacts her ancestor's murderous rage. The police are beginning to suspect that the meek, repressed motel keeper is hiding something, but can Judith's soul be saved before the spirit of her ancestor takes her over forever? The saga of Rip Van Winkle and his tortured descendant comes to a mind-chilling climax in this final installment of the spellbinding R.I.P. franchise.","popularity":0.1967,"poster_path":"/bjMRPPOMQfEQeqYtN2VNEOYyfn6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"R.I.P.
