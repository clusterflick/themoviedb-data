It is an unfinished city, constantly changing, where everything has the charm of the unfinished\". With a sharp eye, Ricardo Bofill observes and comments on volumes and scrolls. Standing, in the nave of the Sagrada Familia, arms outstretched, it pivots on itself as if to take in space. \"You have to have your eyes wide open, move quietly, and at the same time remember what's behind. This is how we have the sense of space. Otherwise this art does not exist.\"","popularity":0.5334,"poster_path":"/tZzPvUDgsaDrvKAvlwAA8Z0HzuH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139750,"logo_path":"/bggQRccEI6j6dSW7aZbQWkaWfze.png","name":"SCEREN-CNDP","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":24033,"logo_path":"/dZ7shHqHbMAD05hQPzYgz5OAKwl.png","name":"France 5","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Barcelone vu par Ricardo Bofill","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1061854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricardo Bofill","original_name":"Ricardo Bofill","popularity":0.0985,"profile_path":"/fwtMobOjBjpBPJUx2N7upVEDMm8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"645b628a3fe160017225bb00","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4054431,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annie Breit","original_name":"Annie Breit","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645b63e63fe16000e3298f2c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4054431,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annie Breit","original_name":"Annie Breit","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645b62c0fe077a5cadf6fe20","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qYX5NFIPAwt7oFLVWV8uwK6WiEn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tZzPvUDgsaDrvKAvlwAA8Z0HzuH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":107,"name":"barcelona, spain"},{"id":6409,"name":"city guide"},{"id":9566,"name":"catalonia, spain"},{"id":12436,"name":"architecture"},{"id":317461,"name":"ricardo bofill"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
