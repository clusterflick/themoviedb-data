It includes students and instructors, musicians, DJ's, performance dancers, \"Milongas\", and special events organizers. Searching for answers to what the Tango means to them, the documentary asks: What is its universal attraction? What awakens them to this passion? What makes them live it so intensely, and how do they find expression in it? HEARTS of TANGO also seeks to demonstrate that the typical sound of this music does not belong only to the city of Buenos Aires, but it is somehow connected to the concept of the city itself, through the memory of its past history, and identified in its architecture. In the same way we try on new clothes to see how they fit, this film tries on Tango music on the city of Toronto, depicting how this new colour and vibrancy fits into its multicultural mosaic.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Close Embrace of Life","title":"Hearts of Tango","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
