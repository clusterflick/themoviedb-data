They hope to learn whether these bats, which harbor viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2, were able to transmit the virus to an animal host, which in turn infected humans. The other hypothesis concerning the origin of Covid-19 is that of a laboratory escape. In 2021, after months of fruitless waiting, a delegation of WHO experts finally arrived in Wuhan, where the virus had spread from. They visited the now-closed former indoor market, where live animals were traded, and the Institute of Virology, although no laboratory safety specialists were among their members.","popularity":0.0627,"poster_path":"/qOZNc2XaaGFwzS6GIUhpHtJNeVF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122245,"logo_path":null,"name":"TV Presse Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Covid-19, la quête des origines","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2693927,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gwenlaouen Le Gouil","original_name":"Gwenlaouen Le Gouil","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6459df13156cc7017d732a20","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1950952,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brice Lambert","original_name":"Brice Lambert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6459dfc23fe160013866c5ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3121188,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Soline Braun","original_name":"Soline Braun","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6459dfd4156cc7017d732a70","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3268251,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olivier Adelen","original_name":"Olivier Adelen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6459e033ae384301386afab2","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27802297","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/qOZNc2XaaGFwzS6GIUhpHtJNeVF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"TP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
