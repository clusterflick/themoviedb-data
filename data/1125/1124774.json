Hailed on their arrival on the scene in 1989 as the future of hip hop, De La Soul were quickly perceived as the leaders of a contingent of New York-based alternative rappers who dubbed themselves The Native Tongues Posse. This movement for a while looked as if it was going to eclipse hardcore hip hop in terms of popularity. This concert, filmed at the 1997 Lokerse Festival, features their big hits 'Me, Myself And I' (with its sample of Funkadelic's '(Not Just) Knee Deep'), 'Ring, Ring, Ring' and 'Breakadawn'.","popularity":0.1262,"poster_path":"/637IhEBbArPkLm9quLbAHyWxmkJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"De La Soul - Me, Myself & I","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3492962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelvin Mercer","original_name":"Kelvin Mercer","popularity":0.1137,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"645ac5d7156cc7011e010528","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2966450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Jolicoeur","original_name":"David Jolicoeur","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"645ac5e86aa8e001738132ae","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":592692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent Mason","original_name":"Vincent Mason","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"645ac60e77d23b0170384104","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2981610","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/637IhEBbArPkLm9quLbAHyWxmkJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1128}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
