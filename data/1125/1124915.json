The artist's existential experience is reflected in these moments, linked up by the lines of his voyages around the world. The director went to France, Morocco and the United States to record again places that were once the artist's inspiration, the landscapes and the walls, to capture their essence, even if only in one shot, one brief glimpse. The films develops through the tension between by Rezníček's contemporary perspective, his documentary invention, and the Diviš's original works, his drawings and fragmentary writings.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sbohem slunce","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0334305","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
