The bacterium, isolated from the artistâ€™s gut, is genetically engineered to incorporate and produce the Human Neuropeptide Y, a gene linked to human resilience, and becomes a microscopic drug-producing factory. The project speculates on releasing the strain into the Beirut water system, thus questioning resilience as a political pretext and looking at the role of the individual in the absence of the state as well as possible modes of alliances between the human and the microbiological world.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":"/6DVLVoFbELbmfl7USze3edR6EfK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Resilience Overflow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3074577,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lara Tabet","original_name":"Lara Tabet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e1b6a413c9ec51e7afea18","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1124,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6DVLVoFbELbmfl7USze3edR6EfK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":749}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
