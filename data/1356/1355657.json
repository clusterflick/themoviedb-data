Gombodorji Zanabazar (1635-1723), the first head of Mongolian Zoroastrianism, the first Bogd, and sculptor, was born in the area of ​​Usan-i-sum in Tusheet Khan Province, now in Uvorkhangai Province. Zanabazar was brought up in a religious school from a young age, and at the age of 15 he was recognized as the incarnation of Jawzandamba. G. Zanabazar's mistakes cannot be forgiven as he played a dark role in losing the country's independence by subjugating Manchuria.
