Her stomach grumbles and she looks for food inside her bag, but she has eaten the last from her dumpster dive. She reflects for a moment on what brought her in this position. It's funny how a series of unfortunate events could bring a young woman, who was well on her way to become an Accountant, to homeless with nothing to account for. She looks at the ads inside of the paper that she uses as a sunscreen, maybe there is a way she could find a job, anything that would help her get ahead. She sees an advertisement for a woman's shelter, her eyes light up. That's it! If only she could have a place to , a residence, a place to keep her body and clothes clean so the smell doesn't offend potential employers.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/9fobftxrXKBPCikre2Ly86jrrX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129315,"logo_path":"/n7Dmi4eY7QsD5JY2sXioweN5jpi.png","name":"AllHerLuv","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Watch the story unfold","title":"Give Me Shelter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":591861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shyla Jennings","original_name":"Shyla Jennings","popularity":2.929,"profile_path":"/wIlqrWPkI0pVg3eyPquTBklgvl3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66e1dce658084b3e13ecc986","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":123092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bridgette B","original_name":"Bridgette B","popularity":26.792,"profile_path":"/6oeaU1NlhiZoQ4evNi3WG6esvAM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66e1dcfcedcbf811e0579c94","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":862,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cIrQto6m4oPdoZ2Bn627rdERktJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1532},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":862,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/axLXvCmbxaC2FgoiColHv9nZ7FF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1532},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":862,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5NVAO4FKX1tVivia60r5XZW97EK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1532}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9fobftxrXKBPCikre2Ly86jrrX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":529}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NC-17","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
