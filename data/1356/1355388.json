Hunter, a jaded employee who spent the last decade behind the concession stand, must finally face his uncertain future. Movie theatre employees and patrons include the former stuntman trying to charm his way into a free ticket, the ornery theatre owner keeping the slackers in line for one more day, the hungry news reporter, and the Australian cowboy and boomerang-slinging movie star. As day turns to night, the small-town community must reckon with its local theatre finally closing its doors.","popularity":0.7164,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":197809,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kebrado","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Concessions","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Madsen","original_name":"Michael Madsen","popularity":1.5049,"profile_path":"/2pKJJKeCggtLOE4hzqgq07KYqFh.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66e1af000bab7e679a1c453b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1336329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven Ogg","original_name":"Steven Ogg","popularity":1.5118,"profile_path":"/n5htiKL3WLNzJOZCLc4NytWV6fY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66e1af070000000000955166","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Hamilton","original_name":"Josh Hamilton","popularity":0.7564,"profile_path":"/7nuAUPd7E8iOE5lhUcNpogS2akP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66e1af100000000000954dc7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1685879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivory Aquino","original_name":"Ivory Aquino","popularity":0.2625,"profile_path":"/voiduAqg5OvTTjqXT1hvmKRxyR6.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66e1af21d9678addbd54e7ed","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1199168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lana Rockwell","original_name":"Lana Rockwell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66e1af2a000000000022ad68","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2931385,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rob Riordan","original_name":"Rob Riordan","popularity":0.1227,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Hunter","credit_id":"66e1af31000000000095522f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1703400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Price","original_name":"Jonathan Price","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"66e1af42e288cfdd2b54e2dc","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2876730,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mas Bouzidi","original_name":"Mas Bouzidi","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":"/nwSQ57f93SUcnrm5GtTbVifP6WK.jpg","credit_id":"66e1af64c7229d26dbafeb1a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2876730,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mas Bouzidi","original_name":"Mas Bouzidi","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":"/nwSQ57f93SUcnrm5GtTbVifP6WK.jpg","credit_id":"66e1af6a7456bbf88736a945","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2876732,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ram Segura Khagram","original_name":"Ram Segura Khagram","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e1af7ef370a2eda254e62c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2948727,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Malcolm Brainerd","original_name":"Malcolm Brainerd","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e1af8f86eb1130178b35d0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4936807,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sophia Winkler","original_name":"Sophia Winkler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e1af9bc41bbdf46b081441","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1238148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Beckley","original_name":"Michael Beckley","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/vhjZRmWmudJny3JNbBKpoWDFutZ.jpg","credit_id":"66e1afdec3ff8f970708199e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2538562,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Oscar S.
