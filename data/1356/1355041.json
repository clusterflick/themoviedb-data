The narration derives from found tapes Iâ€™d discovered in a thrift store that had been recorded by a man named Archie Olson, speaking to his daughter in Minnesota. In other scenes, texts from Joan of Arc and Eldridge Cleaver, patterns of feathers and seeds falling, Harry Partch percussion music, and imagery of multiplying bacteria supply a view of the American political-cultural landscape that continually shifts from the macrocosmic to microcosmic and from practical and conversational to the occult and religious.","popularity":0.0614,"poster_path":"/bia3c00Zp8VRSeFdWJd1GZan9Vo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Who Shall Remain Nameless","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Whose Word is Forgot","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1352411,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter von Ziegesar","original_name":"Peter von Ziegesar","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/ikT3JKkIX3YMIi1maslyvJ5u3N5.jpg","credit_id":"66e0a31a0000000000d19286","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1352411,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter von Ziegesar","original_name":"Peter von Ziegesar","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/ikT3JKkIX3YMIi1maslyvJ5u3N5.jpg","credit_id":"672c1942f2880d1004f6816e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bia3c00Zp8VRSeFdWJd1GZan9Vo.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
