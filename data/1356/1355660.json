The film shows many conversations had between Ella and their best friend as they trained for their marathon swim. They spoke of the endurance and new found understanding of what one’s body is capable of when in a great body of water, and one has no way of turning back. Ella’s message is clear, that liberation can be beautiful, liberation can be heart breaking, liberation can be a great body of water, liberation can be found in the smallest of things but the grandest of feelings. Such as swimming through water.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"S'well","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4933391,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ella Frost","original_name":"Ella Frost","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e27d960000000000b9084b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
