This documentary follows Siufung's journey as they reflect on their experiences in Hong Kong and embark on a new chapter in the United States, continuing their fight to build a more inclusive and accepting society for all. As a genderfluid individual, poet, and intellectual with a deep interest in Buddhist philosophy, Siufung’s story is one of resilience and defiance. Director Jean-Luc, who has spent 15 years in Asia producing commercials and TV shows for major international clients, uses his expertise to explore the complexities of identity and the ongoing struggle for acceptance in this compelling and deeply personal narrative.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/rbJPJvhUuOxjTRjjrenPk4AV2ij.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"They Are Siufung","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"They Are Siufung Law","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1801832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Luc Bonefacino","original_name":"Jean-Luc Bonefacino","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e1a9874f3a71968054e692","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18769334","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/isdb6zXtatgy0petBC5n1MeU8Hu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rbJPJvhUuOxjTRjjrenPk4AV2ij.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"ALL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Seoul International Pride Film Festival","release_date":"2024-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Taiwan International Queer Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Atlanta's LGBTQ Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
