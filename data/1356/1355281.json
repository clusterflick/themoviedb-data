This unsettling true-crime interrogation probes into the eerie, enigmatic cultural undercurrents that shaped 1970's folk horror genre, leaving an indelible mark on cinema and public psyche. The Last Sacrifice uncovers an unflinching portrayal of Britain's profound identity crisis, both during the tumultuous early 1970s and the resurgence of folk horror today, ominously coinciding with yet another national descent into madness. Its conclusion: The Wicker Man is more fact than fiction.","popularity":0.3307,"poster_path":"/hF7CY6NvualvjDaUJEySuBLDGnj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141081,"logo_path":null,"name":"Intermission Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Valentine’s Day 1945.
