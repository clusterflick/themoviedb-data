His passionate rhymes are bizarre, surreal, personal, sometimes downright nasty massive free association. Sharkula is an artist whose passion is living and breathing Hip Hop at all times. What keeps him in the game is making his music and pushing it exclusively on the streets every day. His uncompromising D.I.Y. approach brings him face-to-face with infamy, rejection, and misunderstanding.\r Featuring interviews with fans, friends and longtime collaborators including PNS of The Molemen, J2K of Flosstradamus, Roburt Reynolds Wrap, The Graduate, and many more. Complete with unreleased 16 mm and VHS archival footage, live performances, candid street interviews, and an original score by Jeremiah Jae.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/uFSc6QAy7BP8PbuAe9puc24NmfR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sharkula: Diarrhea of a Madman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1766080","wikidata_id":"Q7489874","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uFSc6QAy7BP8PbuAe9puc24NmfR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
