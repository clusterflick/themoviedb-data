Live-action, rotoscoped, and cutout characters frame the abstract animation of the main body of the film as a story told to a grandson -- a creation story that eventually gets out of control. Ink and paint on cels, drawing on paper, rotoscoping, cameraless, drawing under the camera, and cutout animation. Made while a full-time science student at the University of British Columbia during an elective arts course in animation with Al Sens, 1975.  First prize (post-secondary) & \"Best of Show\" - 7th Annual British Columbia Student Film Festival, 1975 [prior to going to film school].  Given name was Stephen Arthur Bowlsby, legally changed to Stephen Arthur in 1994.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":"/8xAoL6S2uxOgre78IsT92UeOaOw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anizen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4938127,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Bowlsby","original_name":"Stephen Bowlsby","popularity":0.0857,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e2acfe9013fe8722237deb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":755,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8xAoL6S2uxOgre78IsT92UeOaOw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":503}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
