In 1990, Parretti bought iconic James Bond studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer/United Artists for $1.3B with high hopes. However, within weeks, the 17th James Bond film (GoldenEye) was put on ice, paycheques to Dustin Hoffman and Sylvester Stallone had bounced, and hundreds of staff were fired. Parretti soon faced an FBI investigation for alleged financial irregularities and his ownership of Hollywood’s most famous studio spiraled out of control.","popularity":0.2316,"poster_path":"/etMgfOM7iCYVnZZuMeX9FHtgQ2P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":144562,"logo_path":"/9OeGKAVHdOkdeGTpg3ucs86ABPP.png","name":"Wonderhood Studios","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":181874,"logo_path":"/crrgXvLhDO9c57HYrbO4H58Vxmb.png","name":"Fifth Season","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Man Who Definitely Didn't Steal Hollywood","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3175569,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Giancarlo Parretti","original_name":"Giancarlo Parretti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66e0d1b40000000000952bc1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150347,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Dower","original_name":"John Dower","popularity":0.0809,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e0d1de236a9b171e368513","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150347,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Dower","original_name":"John Dower","popularity":0.0809,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e0d1e800000000004c709e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150347,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Dower","original_name":"John Dower","popularity":0.0809,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e0d1f107df9e2ad2bb3dd8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33545608","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rvmGIm7SO0WvriCESyu6RWn0SiV.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5YvufhOwXChIljlfzm1KwpICYLU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/etMgfOM7iCYVnZZuMeX9FHtgQ2P.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nq2o1PsN3Ss02z3YKbWpVi4SNhN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3692,"name":"scandal"},{"id":12396,"name":"hollywood"},{"id":210608,"name":"1990s"},{"id":240847,"name":"social & cultural documentary"},{"id":328982,"name":"hollywood scandal"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
