What price can be put on the life of such majestic animals? How can we estimate that cost? And how have humans changed the way they value whales throughout history? What are whales used for? What are they needed for?  To answer these questions, and many more, Natacha Aguilar, eminent Canary Island marine biologist and expert in cetaceans, guides us on a spectacular – and highly personal – journey through time and space.  With the help of a committed group of scientists and non-profit organizations, A Whale’s Worth discovers the remarkable, little-known lives of these animals.","popularity":0.1739,"poster_path":"/zQbiKCTrJgRa5Z17Hlx2e5ZuzhG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":238770,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ballenas y hombres AIE","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2021-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Whale’s Worth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4870515,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Virginia G.
