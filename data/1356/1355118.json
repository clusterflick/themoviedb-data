Eisuke Taniguchi (Shimizu), president of Towa Electric Works, has three beautiful daughters. The eldest, Kozue (Todoroki), is an intelligent and dynamic modern girl, the second, Yoko (Otowa), is a modest girl with Japanese tastes, and the third, Hanayo (Wakayama), is a mischievous girl who has not yet lost her schoolgirl temperament. All three have feelings for Kiichiro Matsuzaki (Uehara), the president of a magazine company. He was married to Kozue, the eldest daughter, by agreement between their parents, but it was Yoko whom he loved, so he asked her to end her engagement to him.","popularity":0.4111,"poster_path":"/9PpBzJayXNHlVTNvQ96Qde1zexF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":880,"logo_path":"/vwhPRAZ4lhUtSuaifk4Au2MIm92.png","name":"Daiei Film","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1950-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shojohou","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Uehara","original_name":"上原謙","popularity":0.4956,"profile_path":"/5Gea9YY469WW5Ga3u6raemmQuVM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Kiichiro","credit_id":"66e0d2f10000000000228898","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":134259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yukiko Todoroki","original_name":"轟夕起子","popularity":0.4372,"profile_path":"/vdFiE6vIBTJgd2EiKH5Fpsvb7pB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Taniguchi Kozue","credit_id":"66e0d30600000000002288c7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":33728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nobuko Otowa","original_name":"乙羽信子","popularity":0.7652,"profile_path":"/6vcByiFlOE9JiLGWNKRtN8k0uil.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Taniguchi Yoko","credit_id":"66e0d319236a9b171e368516","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":18608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Setsuko Wakayama","original_name":"若山セツ子","popularity":0.3061,"profile_path":"/5UrI66vwMJgmtbw4ZjQu1JjWi6w.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Taniguchi Kayo","credit_id":"66e0d3319d088dae057470d5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masao Shimizu","original_name":"清水将夫","popularity":0.3199,"profile_path":"/77QHN0Ac5Oq31R1PKQSIVX3nFzX.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Taniguchi Eisuke","credit_id":"66e0d34cac9a5eb6047470e0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":548040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hiroshi Nihon'yanagi","original_name":"二本柳寛","popularity":0.2143,"profile_path":"/iHFZliMVkEFlhBIsslhv47gmyXb.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66e0d365b6a995954454c0c2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jun Negami","original_name":"根上淳","popularity":0.5449,"profile_path":"/SkBxSNNBQ0xEuxxmxkL856Jfwq.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"66e0d36d69618da6c05edf35","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Haruo Tanaka","original_name":"田中春男","popularity":0.4208,"profile_path":"/eziah9QZcIs3SVPgTS3iuyUpiW3.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"66e0d38f7ead9a992b5edee8","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1057573,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Keigo Kimura","original_name":"木村恵吾","popularity":0.2596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e0d3a9744254672104f420","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33727,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kaneto Shindō","original_name":"Kaneto Shindō","popularity":0.5705,"profile_path":"/slPRV7aV1R2W15HeVztiapjRdOH.jpg","credit_id":"66e0d3b19ca66df582bb3da6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113602,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tsuneo Tomita","original_name":"富田常雄","popularity":0.1553,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e53b83f3d3f8bff96d7526","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":554992,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Shigeyoshi Mine","original_name":"峰重義","popularity":0.2064,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e53cec96e93efb9d2e2b08","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125001,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ichirō Saitō","original_name":"斎藤一郎","popularity":0.0825,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c6af09575a1805be907ed9","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8954560","wikidata_id":"Q11625321","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lkp8bB3XAFbJk1Jw3DOY206OaFW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9PpBzJayXNHlVTNvQ96Qde1zexF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nr8W2LMAoOBIQ4RN4CAw9PvLqxj.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1950-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
