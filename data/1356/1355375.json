Refusing to live with the humiliation, he became a wandering spirit. However, death turned out to be his stroke of luck, granting him the ability to possess others, even influencing their thoughts. Naked, he traveled across countries, embarking on a series of fantastical and hedonistic human experiences. In the end, despite gathering with other wanderers, these spirits still couldn't let go of their obsessions with human love, eventually falling into the emotional whirlpool of Stockholm Syndrome. This is a reimagined and enhanced version of Scud's Bodyshop (2022), offering an even more intense experience.","popularity":0.0874,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ghosts Just Want to Have Fun","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134851,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Scud","original_name":"云翔","popularity":0.5568,"profile_path":"/keNiAN5q0Cl2NgYd7Ih7w7jhBR5.jpg","credit_id":"66e1a77cefcc369dcccc9548","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mfnHziMtBV2gliZjb9H3xuKCqB2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Taiwan International Queer Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
