Commissioned by Salvador Allende to host the Third World Conference of the United Nations, the building was inaugurated on April 3rd, 1972. El Cuarto Mundo was an unprecedented sculptural proposal for its time; its circles moved with the wind and were reflected in a mirror of water, integrating into its surroundings and context. On September 11, 1973, the coup d'état took place in Chile. Days later, the sculpture, along with other works located there, was dismantled and disappeared, with no traces of its parade known to this day.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Un documental sobre El Cuarto Mundo","title":"La Memoria del Vacío","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4937231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miguel Lawner","original_name":"Miguel Lawner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"66e1e6aae0de4f6b2712d4aa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4937232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Ortúzar","original_name":"Andrea Ortúzar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"66e1e6bce733f612c2f6ae3b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4937228,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Marcela Ilabaca Zamorano","original_name":"Marcela Ilabaca Zamorano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e1e642e6f5129b61906f2e","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4937228,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Marcela Ilabaca Zamorano","original_name":"Marcela Ilabaca Zamorano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e1e6581624bfa48c7b653e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4937229,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Francisco Sanfuentes","original_name":"Francisco Sanfuentes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e1e66b34eb94f133323563","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4937230,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alberto Lucendo","original_name":"Alberto Lucendo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e1e69234eb94f133323571","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
