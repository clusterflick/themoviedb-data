During interrogation, they recounted their struggle to secure grant funding.\r Using an AI application developed by their friends at Anarko, Santosa and his crew, who failed to obtain a grant from the ministry, resorted to manipulating an online lottery to get the production money and submit their film to a festival.\r After completing the shoot, they were arrested by the police and sentenced. Two months later, thanks to the efforts of their editor, Asep, who wasn't arrested, their film won a festival award.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/cGaCyqn1sfYKVjDuHkAKl73pgGa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2023-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pemburu Hibah","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cGaCyqn1sfYKVjDuHkAKl73pgGa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"id","note":"","release_date":"2023-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
