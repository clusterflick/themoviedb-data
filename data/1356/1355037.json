The film also features my friend, the artist David Saunders, playing the 19th-century French Symbolist poet, Arthur Rimbaud, as he reads from one of the poet’s most famous works, Alchemy of the Word. The film, as well as the poem, are about synesthesia: the artist’s transformation of one sense into another, turning light into sound, sound into emotion, and words into images.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/6CVgc6jtZNXzJQ2QkcKXo6lDzM7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alchemy of the Word","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1352411,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter von Ziegesar","original_name":"Peter von Ziegesar","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/ikT3JKkIX3YMIi1maslyvJ5u3N5.jpg","credit_id":"66e0a1a3913a9b6311f8ced9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1352411,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter von Ziegesar","original_name":"Peter von Ziegesar","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/ikT3JKkIX3YMIi1maslyvJ5u3N5.jpg","credit_id":"672c18ed898d18e69095eb87","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sQIxj3qXzc1o1bIgSm5yUQVqhD8.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9hw0dATBpqaKcLOlTiaLRYVRrJ8.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1921}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6CVgc6jtZNXzJQ2QkcKXo6lDzM7.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
