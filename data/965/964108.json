Bajo el Tacaná uses the migrant´s testimonies and first-hand accounts from bystanders, such as a taxi driver in Tapachula and a doctor who tends the prostitutes to chronicle the atrocities that take place in the Mexico- Guatemala border. Voice-over adds meaning to the film, while the music conveys what we couldn´t or wouldn´t dare to record on video.","popularity":0.0974,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bajo el Tacaná","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1149201,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carlos Rossini","original_name":"Carlos Rossini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625c8000d38b5817adc68df5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1206839,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Federico Schmucler","original_name":"Federico Schmucler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625c801bf10a1a15ecab5dea","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1050909,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Natalia Almada","original_name":"Natalia Almada","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/wF39gtOmm5r4jElFqawiCLkisvk.jpg","credit_id":"625c823eb2681f00a1ac7a10","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3511465,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isabel Vericat","original_name":"Isabel Vericat","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625c803285702e0051ebceb5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1125285","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
