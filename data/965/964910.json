His heart breaks in two when he realizes his best friend, Donny, did not. Things spiral further out of control when it is revealed that Rudolph's older brother, Randy, was the man behind the murders, and that their parents will stop at nothing to keep him out of prison. Now Rudolph must decide for himself whether he will bend to his family's will, like he always has, or if he will stand up to them, stand by the community that his brother destroyed, and find some sense of justice for the person he loved most in the world.","popularity":0.1014,"poster_path":"/efwFCN1zHCiHd2M5RPVfFbt6nrm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wild Life","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3514491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thatcher Jacobs","original_name":"Thatcher Jacobs","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Rudolph Priest","credit_id":"625f0e2f25cd850050c7a801","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3304735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Oilar","original_name":"Michael Oilar","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Benjamin 'Ben' Priest","credit_id":"625f0e4bdfaae9017049b84f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3514493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Richards","original_name":"Rebecca Richards","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Abigail Priest","credit_id":"625f0e573d74540053dcc068","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3514494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Wartman","original_name":"Jack Wartman","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Randall 'Randy' Priest","credit_id":"625f0e63befb090098940a4c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2960101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Medina Kincy","original_name":"Medina Kincy","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Bridget Abercrombie","credit_id":"625f0e9cd1a8930051729822","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3514502,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mattson Ruedin","original_name":"Mattson Ruedin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Donovan 'Donny' Abercrombie","credit_id":"625f0ea7323eba0066d0b7fe","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3514503,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackson Ark","original_name":"Jackson Ark","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Deshi Cao","credit_id":"625f0eb3db952d004f886899","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3514505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alyson Lo","original_name":"Alyson Lo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Araminta 'Minty' Cao","credit_id":"625f0ec2db952d004f88691a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3514506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lauren Edwards","original_name":"Lauren Edwards","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Basil Barcus","credit_id":"625f0ed285702e0051bacb20","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3514508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allysia Jensen","original_name":"Allysia Jensen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Mallory 'Mac' Sakowitz","credit_id":"625f0ee4dfaae90173643ae1","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3861995,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Calvin Zimmerman","original_name":"Calvin Zimmerman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b96496f8595800c84a3a05","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18469778","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":1154,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/efwFCN1zHCiHd2M5RPVfFbt6nrm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":776}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"R","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Wild Life (2022) - Official Trailer","key":"BHPszUFyx_c","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-11-07T00:38:35.000Z","id":"625f0e05323eba009b650c85"}]}}}
