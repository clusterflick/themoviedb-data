This surreal scene is like a period in the personal correspondence between two Japanese filmmakers. In the director’s mind, the faded 8mm footage depicts artifacts that evoke phantoms of the past. But besides aimless wanderings through the streets of his hometown, a collection of photographs of a women’s wrestling team, or the handmade mask of Mexican superhero El Santa, the camera also shows its own image. In this experimental correspondence written with a camera instead of a pen, the central theme is one of mirrors and reflections representing the connection between subject and object, life and film.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/znrmwdxHI70n7LaMJSQ6eL4CO54.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lake","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"MIZUUMI WA HITO WO NOMIKOMU","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","title":"吃人之湖","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4467176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoshiko Miyakawa","original_name":"Yoshiko Miyakawa","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65995cf9bd588b01a957254c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3511217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shinichi Miyakawa","original_name":"Shinichi Miyakawa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625c577fbf09d10066bd244d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4467177,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Motoshi Fujinami","original_name":"Motoshi Fujinami","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65995d121d1bf400f39fc0e6","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4151224","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/znrmwdxHI70n7LaMJSQ6eL4CO54.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"South Taiwan Film Festival","release_date":"2024-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
