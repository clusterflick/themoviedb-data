The conflict between father and son leaves Mrs. Randall heartbroken, and when she dies, she makes her husband swear to help James if he ever needs it. When Joe Merrion, a bookmaker, is found dead, circumstantial evidence points to Squire William Rufford. Although Randall can't believe he committed the crime, he is forced to convict him and sentence him to prison. But later, when James, whose wild ways have left him penniless, comes to his father for help, Randall discovers that he was the killer.","popularity":0.2251,"poster_path":"/qmJUdx7M6FMQZMNwcf02z6c2Xi3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Who Killed Joe Merrion?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Kilgour","original_name":"Joseph Kilgour","popularity":0.0884,"profile_path":"/sBezq0JDRm4n3m5PxW54tDDEN2y.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sir Phillip Randall","credit_id":"625ef814168ea300523b4af7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2447075,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"S.
