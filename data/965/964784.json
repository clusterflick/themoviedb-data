For him, falconry is more than a deep partnership with raptors: it’s his life’s work. As an American falconry ambassador, he’s carved a space for himself where people of color haven’t always been welcome. It's taken him across the globe, into strongholds of tradition and conservation. This film is about more than what humans can train birds to do—it’s about what those birds can teach us about living in partnership with wild creatures and wild places.","popularity":0.0919,"poster_path":"/BB9uhRD9wtVg6ZhvGi59OgmMy6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Game Hawker","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3514041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shawn Hayes","original_name":"Shawn Hayes","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"625ebff9f10a1a544982ebcd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1284983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joshua Izenberg","original_name":"Joshua Izenberg","popularity":0.0853,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625ebff13dd1263749cad062","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1284983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joshua Izenberg","original_name":"Joshua Izenberg","popularity":0.0853,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625ec05c19690c00a7613071","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1789893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brett Marty","original_name":"Brett Marty","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/no2Iutzd8aLMD9cTO0h6NKqE8Ah.jpg","credit_id":"625ec06bd38b5817af9cbf83","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1789893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brett Marty","original_name":"Brett Marty","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/no2Iutzd8aLMD9cTO0h6NKqE8Ah.jpg","credit_id":"625ec382f10a1a544aded31b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3514041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shawn Hayes","original_name":"Shawn Hayes","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625ec38a3dd1263749caddf2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3503249,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Traci Loth","original_name":"Traci Loth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625ec39cf10a1a544841f19f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1469053,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Todd Hannigan","original_name":"Todd Hannigan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625ec3a5bb260251bf847ca1","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1965391,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Monika McClure","original_name":"Monika McClure","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625ec3aff10a1a544841f1fa","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1408909,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alex Lowther","original_name":"Alex Lowther","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625ec3bc8ac3d0160367dd0b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3403848,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Niki Waltl","original_name":"Niki Waltl","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625ec3c6dd731b3289c8c751","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1972011,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jason Joseffer","original_name":"Jason Joseffer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625ec3d1229ae232170feb83","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3377417,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dan Edwards","original_name":"Dan Edwards","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625ec3ddbf09d100993c8931","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1880636,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Owen Bissell","original_name":"Owen Bissell","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644dc337d1ca2a0affb2e89e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/BB9uhRD9wtVg6ZhvGi59OgmMy6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DocLands","release_date":"2022-05-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
