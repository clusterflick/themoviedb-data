From their immense buttresses to the intricacies of their stained glass, the Gothic cathedrals stand as complex, richly designed celebration for all we hold most sacred, and as an articulation of joy and accomplishment. Reaching heavenward, they may be synonymous with medieval France, but perhaps the most famous lies right here in America.  In 1891, Charles Glover Gathers, a prominent Washington banker, promoted the idea of a National Cathedral as a moral center. For the first time on DVD, follow the construction of this massive cathedral--which surpasses even the Notre Dame and the Chartres in size--and discover how 12th and 20th century methods were combined to raise 300 million pounds of limestone.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/j7q5jbK8oYfymO8aejbSKKJGslu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Modern Marvels: Gothic Cathedrals","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j7q5jbK8oYfymO8aejbSKKJGslu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":526}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
