Disobeying the Angel’s command not to look back, Lot’s wife turns into a salt statue. For this project the artist has made a series of drawings where the salt creates hollows in the paper, distorts it, damages it and in doing so, creates forms and designs.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/y8Fa7DkvLacwz6TZTOzL38uFO2p.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dead Sea Drawing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3513740,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edith Dekyndt","original_name":"Edith Dekyndt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625e76ccd38b5817af9bfea8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.656,"height":1034,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y8Fa7DkvLacwz6TZTOzL38uFO2p.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":678}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
