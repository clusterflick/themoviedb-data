Is Geoff playing an elaborate prank, somehow provoking New Yorkers to cross borroughs to purchase a fifteen-cent cracker? Or is he paving the way for the greatest artistic revolution since Andy Warhol's pop movement of the 60s? In this documentary short, filmmakers Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck capture the candid humor and poignancy of Lupo's seemingly absurd interactions.","popularity":0.0887,"poster_path":"/3fvMAg6Qb15oc2VX9t1bEggcdvZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Have You Seen This Man?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3512509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geoff Lupo","original_name":"Geoff Lupo","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"625d6a6268ff70169d4e2c88","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":53069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Boden","original_name":"Anna Boden","popularity":0.3088,"profile_path":"/i75ESF5oge5ELfBoBhcJymkvqNW.jpg","credit_id":"625d6a3519690c00a75b25a0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53068,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Fleck","original_name":"Ryan Fleck","popularity":0.2617,"profile_path":"/28EMTivPGStNxDivgUP8PSpOrof.jpg","credit_id":"625d6a52d266a233179729ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0360635","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3fvMAg6Qb15oc2VX9t1bEggcdvZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
