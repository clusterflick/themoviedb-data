When Lord Earle hears of the relationship, he brings Valentine Charteris to the estate to distract his lovesick son. True to his love, however, Ronald refuses Valentine and marries Dora. After emigrating to Italy, Ronald earns a modest living as a painter, and Dora gives birth to twins. When Ronald receives a generous commission to paint a portrait, he asks Dora to pose for him, but overly preoccupied with the children, she refuses. Wounded by the rejection, Ronald calls on Valentine Charteris and quickly becomes infatuated with her, forcing Dora to return to Earlescourt with the twins.","popularity":0.3189,"poster_path":"/79UjBdCuwYhk0U8beRBflPAwQKV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dora Thorne","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lionel Barrymore","original_name":"Lionel Barrymore","popularity":0.8391,"profile_path":"/ru11rLUzzLwKjR0ykTLkNIN9jcJ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lord Earle","credit_id":"625f3bde0792e10176f92d08","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Russell","original_name":"William Russell","popularity":0.125,"profile_path":"/aX8jIPumedzNkhgtrCo02XmQtiu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ronald","credit_id":"625f3beba5046e00a4733fdd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2655982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Millicent Evans","original_name":"Millicent Evans","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Dora Thorne","credit_id":"625f3bfe32489b009b11c4c0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Jefferson","original_name":"Thomas Jefferson","popularity":0.0558,"profile_path":"/gex6qMoUTPOXUeaR3QAuJ0el2Na.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dora's Father","credit_id":"625f3c0fdfaae9017364f49d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1633862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabel Rea","original_name":"Isabel Rea","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/rx5q7CTT6RMSSkP1q8wXJotupen.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Valentine Charteris","credit_id":"625f3c22dfaae901704a83e0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Hill Mailes","original_name":"Charles Hill Mailes","popularity":0.2026,"profile_path":"/At3GtUXi9WLKero09JGxxVCY6Ph.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Prince Borgezi","credit_id":"625f3c34168ea300672fce1a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2655983,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mrs. A.C.
