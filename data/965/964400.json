The sculpture was commissioned by Cathedraltown’s developer, and donated to the City of Markham as a public art piece. The residents, however, quickly rose in opposition to a sculpture that they felt did not represent them, and negatively affected their quiet suburban community.  Charity is presented as a public digital artwork produced by the National Film Board of Canada in partnership with Museum of Contemporary Art, Toronto. The interactive documentary employs 360° video and photogrammetry to share a variation on the familiar interactive real estate tour –– where a house in Cathedraltown becomes a site to collect and re-narrate a community’s confrontation with a piece of public art, in turn offering a portrait of private property.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Charity","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1537466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Ferko","original_name":"Ryan Ferko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/uFJsY1I7HAqFTFKAVCXD0lqdJ6K.jpg","credit_id":"625da1c767b6130069b37917","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1537464,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Faraz Anoushahpour","original_name":"Faraz Anoushahpour","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/pE8g8w8jKGf7mlXDdQp7VGHocLA.jpg","credit_id":"625da1d5bb26022f3307efb5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1537465,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Parastoo Anoushahpour","original_name":"Parastoo Anoushahpour","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/dZWyy4XKOZ2slKfddeF3rveKC8Y.jpg","credit_id":"625da1e4bb26022f3307f06b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
