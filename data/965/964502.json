A second letter informs Harold that the money cannot be found, and that his legacy consists of one fur coat. Determined to make a splash in the village, he dons the coat and keeps his appointment with the belle, although it leaves him broke when she is done satisfying her Broadway appetite. Uncle Ben, the pawnbroker, comes in handy and after much haggling over the price, he relieves Harold of the legacy. When Harold learns that his uncle's fortune was sewed up in the lining of the coat he has some job getting the \"benny\" back, but he finally succeeds and recovers the cash.","popularity":0.1222,"poster_path":"/vzelIjFGnztJZgWTH5xCG8ezBdc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fur Coat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2138566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Dangman","original_name":"William Dangman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Harold","credit_id":"625dd31333a376006552cc6d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1190461,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"George O'Donnell","original_name":"George O'Donnell","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"The Owner of the Grocery","credit_id":"625dd32b3dd126142d871db4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3513166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shirley Moore","original_name":"Shirley Moore","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"The Village Belle","credit_id":"625dd33f2d3721009e6429d3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3513168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Whiting","original_name":"Ralph Whiting","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"The Tramp","credit_id":"625dd3509ee0ef0066fa6f63","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Currier","original_name":"Frank Currier","popularity":0.1276,"profile_path":"/1j34PFDp9rAMPtospPYrR9CHY0.jpg","credit_id":"625dd2f73dd126142ea4b820","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3513163,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Edward J.
