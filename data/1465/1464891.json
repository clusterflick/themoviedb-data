I do not own the license to the IP or the characters in any way. This was made as a labor of love for my fans. The content is owned by Universal Studios and TellTale Games.  It's not a true Back to the Future 4 (IV) but it's a good consolation prize. It goes way beyond merely having all the cut scenes in a row.  To fully experience this film you must have seen the original Back to the Future trilogy.
