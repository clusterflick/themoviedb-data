Both were members of the Video Sector, founded by Radek Pilař. They participated in the first presentations of these video artists, as they called themselves. Slauka, like Věra Geislerová or another member of the Video Sector, Lucie Svobodová, saw new possibilities of visual expression in computer animation. Slauka, who focuses on recordings of everyday and even intimate situations in his photography, devoted his computer animation to simulating space and depicting everyday things as attributes of the material world.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/fE7gn52Nvec4XDjxXAS9PzMyfgu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flower","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1598428,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"René Slauka","original_name":"René Slauka","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fd1b5a61b1c4bb329933b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fE7gn52Nvec4XDjxXAS9PzMyfgu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":673}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
