In the film, a pair of allegorical figures of disorientation and order (David Pacholík and Ivana Málková) navigate the metro spaces in repetitive movements and confront a system of rules, procedures and geometric order. It authentically illustrates the period atmosphere of personal choice between social resignation, tacticianism in public space or the search for inner freedom, which could be provided by relatively free movement in a parallel world.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/2znHkjiBfjSKfRjkYFpt3mvgmBM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Metrofilm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5370186,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Tatíček","original_name":"Ivan Tatíček","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fbfaa63110bd82dfad0334","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2znHkjiBfjSKfRjkYFpt3mvgmBM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
