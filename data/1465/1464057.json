They met in Libya in 2019, in the abyss of a detention center. Yonas managed to escape and attempted several times to cross the Mediterranean. Like many others who jump from one hell to another, Yonas's only option was to flee forward, and what lay before him was a small boat. Yonas's News chronicles the epic journey in which his life was at stake, summarized in the WhatsApp and voice messages, photos, and videos he was able to exchange with Jérôme. Jérôme Tubiana, journalist, researcher, and member of Doctors Without Borders, has visited Libya five times between 2018 and 2020.","popularity":0.1442,"poster_path":"/wuQAb8VP9aGhCiLDddRkm7JH0jn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Yonas tries to reach Europe, we know it from his chats","title":"Notices from Yonas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Noticias de Yonas","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5370408,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jérôme Tubiana","original_name":"Jérôme Tubiana","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fc0f69ec22ba3b49d95ef4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1543612,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gustavo Almenara","original_name":"Gustavo Almenara","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fc0f7cc74c16bf88ad39d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2664261,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Aurélie Pollet","original_name":"Aurélie Pollet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fc0f89765c5222f39930f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":947,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jWWCFtQCiI6WiudEPPCygBtLiu0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1687}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wuQAb8VP9aGhCiLDddRkm7JH0jn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5949,"name":"doctors without borders"},{"id":8344,"name":"lebanon war"},{"id":287773,"name":"inmigration"},{"id":289049,"name":"refugees"},{"id":309328,"name":"documentary short"},{"id":322980,"name":"animated documentary"},{"id":350267,"name":"social cinema"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
