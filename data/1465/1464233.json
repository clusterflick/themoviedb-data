Even in outports and relatively small Newfoundland communities, young people are vulnerable to becoming infected with HIV. The story centres on Trudy Parsons who was 20 when she contracted the virus, a young woman with the determination to show others that people like us do get it. The direct and candid way in which trudy and her friends discuss current social and personal views of sexuality makes for another stirring experience that inspires as much as it moves.","popularity":0.1443,"poster_path":"/oApweruYmU0msE3SProWMoHCkD6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thinking Positive","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5371106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trudy Parsons","original_name":"Trudy Parsons","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67fc824d3015363286d92109","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5371106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trudy Parsons","original_name":"Trudy Parsons","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fc826bde5e4dec62ae1ff5","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3972918,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Val Teodori","original_name":"Val Teodori","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fc8272de5e4dec62ae1ffa","department":"Art","job":"Title Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2714615,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jennice Ripley","original_name":"Jennice Ripley","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fc8279765c5222f3994368","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2184545,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Debbie McGee","original_name":"Debbie McGee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fc8280de5e4dec62ae2004","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3901985,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vanessa Larsen","original_name":"Vanessa Larsen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fc8288de5e4dec62ae2007","department":"Production","job":"Production Secretary"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3964072,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Bryan Innes","original_name":"Bryan Innes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fc8290de5e4dec62ae200b","department":"Crew","job":"Technical Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3964071,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Wayne Cormier","original_name":"Wayne Cormier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fc829fec22ba3b49d977ad","department":"Crew","job":"Technical Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3895855,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Claude Cardinal","original_name":"Claude Cardinal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fc82aaec22ba3b49d977bb","department":"Crew","job":"Technical Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3964074,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jane Boyle","original_name":"Jane Boyle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fc82b1de5e4dec62ae2017","department":"Production","job":"Administration"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2135573,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Steffler","original_name":"Paul Steffler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fc82c13015363286d92133","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5371112,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Roger Howse","original_name":"Roger Howse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fc82cbec22ba3b49d977e7","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4428441,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rick Hollett","original_name":"Rick Hollett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fc82e3ea80d851759a4cd7","department":"Sound","job":"Music Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2531920,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lyly Fortin","original_name":"Lyly Fortin","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fc8327de5e4dec62ae207c","department":"Crew","job":"Editorial Staff"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1871658,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dominique Gusset","original_name":"Dominique Gusset","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fc8332ec22ba3b49d97812","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1567318,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Robert J.
