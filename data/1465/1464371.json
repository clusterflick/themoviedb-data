The strong, graceful Odette captivates us, surrounded by arching backs, spiralling arms and mesmerising formations.  David Dawson’s daring, visceral choreography from Swan Lake is perfectly paired with the rich, romantic Tchaikovsky score in this short film, The Swan, directed by Eve McConnachie.  With an all-female cast led by Constance Devernay-Laurence, The Swan is a powerful showcase of our dancers’ strength and connectivity.","popularity":0.0454,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":132637,"logo_path":"/3j4mQS3YlAlcDPkdwlLh087BKcq.png","name":"Scottish
