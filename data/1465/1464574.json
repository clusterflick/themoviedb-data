Narrated by an older version of one of the key characters, Kennedy Abera, the film follows a single day in the lives of five close friends—Peter Antombey, Kennedy Abera, Sera Flynn, Josh Cramer, and Seth Vargus—as they attempt to make their last day as high schoolers before graduation the best it can be. This movie follows the effects of suppressed depression. At the center is Peter, a charismatic but quietly tormented teen hiding years of abuse and emotional trauma. As Sera documents the day with her camera, subtle cracks begin to show. This is Peter’s story, Peter’s story, told by Kennedy, through the eyes of Sera Flynn.","popularity":0.0944,"poster_path":"/jdhfOtwW9iR3RoBoeW30O9kpCfC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"You never know the time you have until it's gone.","title":"Through the Eyes of Sera Flynn","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5372545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Logan JaySmith","original_name":"Logan JaySmith","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/7gBn934n6tlQCYaiARmfJHHDG0l.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Peter Antombey","credit_id":"67fd63d4765c5222f39969c3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5376763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"JohnMichael Jaques","original_name":"JohnMichael Jaques","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/gHl90BY8kLtDWiUX3Mtxz6X6bXO.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Jordan","credit_id":"67ffec7cef5ae687cbd9b087","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5392401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Parker Caldwell","original_name":"Parker Caldwell","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/d1ySiFetK3o41LI672ZqzS4m4BI.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Alex (archive footage)","credit_id":"6809a2b9142b09cecf8a2503","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5372545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Logan JaySmith","original_name":"Logan JaySmith","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/7gBn934n6tlQCYaiARmfJHHDG0l.jpg","credit_id":"67fd640d7c29ae5bc3d96a8f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5372545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Logan JaySmith","original_name":"Logan JaySmith","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/7gBn934n6tlQCYaiARmfJHHDG0l.jpg","credit_id":"67fd64243110bd82dfad416b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5372545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Logan JaySmith","original_name":"Logan JaySmith","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/7gBn934n6tlQCYaiARmfJHHDG0l.jpg","credit_id":"67fd6442c1e0a708cbad3af1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5372558,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sawyer Luke Ervin","original_name":"Sawyer Luke Ervin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/w6noX9WmTdyPummfI3vPuHNlcAt.jpg","credit_id":"67fd64a1765c5222f3996a18","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5372601,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Angel Finnell","original_name":"Angel Finnell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/68tmztdpPekFewO8fbq7va8BLtb.jpg","credit_id":"67fd6e43765c5222f3996b00","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5372598,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Justice Martin","original_name":"Justice Martin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fd723bc1e0a708cbad4092","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5372552,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ryder J.
