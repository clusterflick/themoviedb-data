Nighttime is coming and her children are hungry. Gmanun is packing 14 years of life in bags and preparing to go home and Maate is controlling the local water pump with an iron fist. In Gushegu 100 women live in exile. They have been expelled from their villages because of witchcraft accusations. As years go by, the women become old and weak, and some are allowed to return home. However, years of separations from their families makes the repatriation challenging.","popularity":0.0621,"poster_path":"/mXMjO9ZF0aMdzrMXVMNgzPJ9eJS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2018-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gushegu Exile","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2580607,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emil Nørgaard Munk","original_name":"Emil Nørgaard Munk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/2ed3tvwpNCvp1xLgDRA29RKFfDF.jpg","credit_id":"67fd67e861b1c4bb329944bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3321515,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nicholas Bluff","original_name":"Nicholas Bluff","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fd68179d1f778ab89937ae","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4889359,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fanni Liv Engelbrecht","original_name":"Fanni Liv Engelbrecht","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/3u8dZFeDouHNF7d1dPyAMQEjldM.jpg","credit_id":"67fd683a3015363286d9547d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5365278","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mXMjO9ZF0aMdzrMXVMNgzPJ9eJS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"CPH:DOX - Copenhagen International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2018-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"OKO International Etnographic Film Festival","release_date":"2020-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"OKO International Etnographic Film Festival (retrospective screening)","release_date":"2021-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
