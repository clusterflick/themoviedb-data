His inventiveness and passion led him to become a popular, innovative, and self-taught technologist, bringing electricity to remote communities in the Andean region for the first time. Awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Los Andes (ULA), his name can be found on the doors of the School of Mechanics at this institution. Until his death in 1990, he continued to work tirelessly on machines and artifacts that resembled beings from other eras.","popularity":0.0437,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El Hombre De La Luz","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1356122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juvel Vielma","original_name":"Juvel Vielma","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67fdbddc7c29ae5bc3d980f9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1292345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leónidas Urbina","original_name":"Leónidas Urbina","popularity":0.049,"profile_path":"/fi13CY6aS25K59Iyy7TQxBJzD9e.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67fdbde93110bd82dfad52e3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilfredo Cisneros","original_name":"Wilfredo Cisneros","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67fdbe03437f0b80eead1a1c","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
