In the summer of 2021, a French film crew has just arrived in Central Asia to begin shooting Nikah. Guzel, the lead actress and a trained circus performer, arrives from Sweden and begins rehearsals under the guidance of the director, Mukaddas. Following Guzel and Mukaddas from rehearsals, to shooting on set, to where they've ended up three years later, this documentary examines the complexities of identity, loss, and what it means to be Uyghur.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I AM HERE / مەن بار","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5939702,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sonya Imin","original_name":"Sonya Imin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696826268ed7fec3eb32ab33","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
