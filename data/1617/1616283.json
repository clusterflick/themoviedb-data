The film presents a static, unchanging scene over an extended duration, inviting viewers to confront time, stillness, and inactivity as meaningful experiences. By rejecting narrative, motion, and traditional structure, it explores the concept of “uselessness” as a form of freedom and quiet resistance to a culture obsessed with efficiency and output.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-12-04","revenue":40,"runtime":999,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Longest Film of All Time","title":"The Freedom of Uselessness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5610902,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samuel Felinton","original_name":"Samuel Felinton","popularity":0.1947,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6967e16116a28aba375a7054","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5492909,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Declan Mungovan","original_name":"Declan Mungovan","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/htioC5wG2EOqdyRPRXutZ4FkLpO.jpg","credit_id":"6967e1687dbc9e948a9a87f3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5610902,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samuel Felinton","original_name":"Samuel Felinton","popularity":0.1947,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6967e232c0e01b8d339e8dc7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5492909,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Declan Mungovan","original_name":"Declan Mungovan","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/htioC5wG2EOqdyRPRXutZ4FkLpO.jpg","credit_id":"6967e24cf9ad7d6a50c5d575","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt38066726","wikidata_id":"Q137782690","facebook_id":"thefreedomofuselessness","instagram_id":"freedomofuselessness","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":228988,"name":"slow cinema"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
