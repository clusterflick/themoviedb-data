In the beginning, film had no voice. Even so, he must have heard the sounds that emanated as he watched. It was late 19th Century Paris that gave birth to both the medium of film and the play “Salome” by Oscar Wilde. In this work, the peculiar connection between the two is articulated through the telling of their stories simultaneously but separately, one in sound and one in images. In the soundtrack (audio), twelve people bombard us with the text of “Salome” in raging billows of songs, chanting, and storytelling, while the video tells the personified history of film dispassionately, in titles.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/j0zAeI8VLyVf4QbUgPJLvab1sTn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Music as film","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1155124,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kei Shichiri","original_name":"七里圭","popularity":0.18,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696811fb85c5387fb85b2178","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1284,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j0zAeI8VLyVf4QbUgPJLvab1sTn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":856}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
