Thousands of \"Cape fur seals\" are fighting a deadly and ever-growing threat: marine debris. Ghost nets, fishing lines and plastic waste drift silently through the ocean, ensnaring thousands of animals each year. UNSEEN LINE follows the work of Ocean Conservation Namibia (OCN), a small but fiercely dedicated NGO founded by Naude and Katja Dreyer. What began as a spontaneous rescue of a single seal has evolved into a full-time mission: a race against the increasing tide of ocean waste.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/x0bUf3lASS63rpddnF3GpvxlMzm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unseen Line","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5939774,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leo Stolz","original_name":"Leo Stolz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696830115a898ab37901a299","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4960666,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leo Stolz","original_name":"Leo Stolz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696830216c274c7bd068a05c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4960664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niklas von Klitzing","original_name":"Niklas von Klitzing","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6968303a349a0e3408dbcd44","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4960664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niklas von Klitzing","original_name":"Niklas von Klitzing","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696830435ffec245b0e70d69","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":854,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x0bUf3lASS63rpddnF3GpvxlMzm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":569}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
