Today, not even 20 remain in the wild—confined to a tiny pocket of habitat in far Eastern North Carolina. This short film uses over four years' worth of National Geographic Explorer Jess Suarez's photographs to tell the imagined story of one young wolf. Raised in captivity, she's eventually released into that last remaining habitat, and in the wild she finds freedom, danger, and the possibility of a new future for her species. Long ago, the red wolf was America's wolf, and with our help they could be again.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/zNPfmskkE4W1gsq4Vx9usaqL1ok.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":269647,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Geographic Society Impact Story Lab","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"America's Wolf","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5939769,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Devin Swanson","original_name":"Devin Swanson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69682eb1fc53806d31a87bd4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5939770,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sam Sheline","original_name":"Sam Sheline","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69682ebfa0d6ea937d078941","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zNPfmskkE4W1gsq4Vx9usaqL1ok.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
