Her words become a dance, and the story begins. An enigmatic note has been left on the table: “I’m going to the mountain.“ Who wrote it—mother then, or me now? The single ray of a flashlight roves through the darkness. The thundering roar of a falling tree lacerates the silence. Burning meadows, translucent horses, and beautiful mother in memory. A mysterious group, Wangel , does an uncanny dance, in gymnastic movements. While horses, horses, horses bound across snowy fields. These waves of images intersect with the woman ‘s unceasing monologue.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/3PK1eHs5GWMuxA3u0LD0pvgfBN5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Salome’s Daughter / Another Side (First Fruits)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1155124,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kei Shichiri","original_name":"七里圭","popularity":0.18,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69680fa4ba2d62417fc4d756","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1284,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3PK1eHs5GWMuxA3u0LD0pvgfBN5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":856}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
