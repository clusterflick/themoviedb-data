She tried for years to write her story and couldn't. Eighteen years later, she's building a world where that trauma belongs to someone else—narrated by DANI, the artificial consciousness she created to watch over her fictional selves. The film reveals her rebuilding identity through imagination, and asks what happens when the only way to tell the truth is through fiction.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Yztari","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5939334,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mary Dague","original_name":"Mary Dague","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6967f5d9f9dac88c4f8e50d2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5939330,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim O'Donnell","original_name":"Tim O'Donnell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6967f552fe65a63d968e4ffb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5939332,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Oldmeadow","original_name":"Sam Oldmeadow","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6967f56e59045dd5612f88a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5939334,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mary Dague","original_name":"Mary Dague","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6967f59956fbb539aa8e5104","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5939340,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jon Mercer","original_name":"Jon Mercer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6967f607f3877ebec72f88dc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5939344,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Allison Silva","original_name":"Allison Silva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6967f62762583f51c12f88a8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5939345,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vincent Vargas","original_name":"Vincent Vargas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6967f649f3877ebec72f88e8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5939334,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mary Dague","original_name":"Mary Dague","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6967f65d62583f51c12f88ad","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5939350,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeff Schmidt","original_name":"Jeff Schmidt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6967f683355d8f3b63c5d64f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
