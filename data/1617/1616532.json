And that, in reality, is most of us. In an instant, a world has been shattered. No one knows what to say because there are no sufficient words. Walls go up and those in grief are left isolated. And because of the isolation, they don’t know that others experience something similar. Into the Light of a Dark Black Night is a documentary feature that allows the participants to tell their stories directly, without the interjection of narration, commentary, or data. It is not about statistics or studies. It is about survival. It is candid, raw, engaging, and heartbreakingly powerful. It is offered with the hope that, as their stories honor their loved ones, they will also shed light for those who are feeling alone in their grief, and for those who’d like to better support them.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Into the Light of a Dark Black Night","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5939875,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dianne Martin","original_name":"Dianne Martin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69683fdfdd43f3820bdbcdf0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5939875,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dianne Martin","original_name":"Dianne Martin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69684024defb8166bd0789d0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5939875,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dianne Martin","original_name":"Dianne Martin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69684037556ae6b7b768a09b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5939881,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Pellington","original_name":"Mark Pellington","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696840598d4492c17bf40715","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
