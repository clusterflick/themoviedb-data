On the train he met Stanisław Michowski, who was returning from the Bolshevik War. Michowski knew Japanese and persuaded Umeda to visit Warsaw. The Japanese man knew nothing about Poland, but he followed Michowski’s advice and got off at the station in Warsaw. He stayed there until 1939. He taught Japanese at the University of Warsaw and translated Polish literature into Japanese (including Quo Vadis). Yoshiho will be spoken about by his friends and family.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Góral z Tokio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5940802,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bożena Garus-Hockuba","original_name":"Bożena Garus-Hockuba","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6968e6c9ba70d668d8dbd0d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
