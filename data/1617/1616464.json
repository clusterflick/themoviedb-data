However, only the voices of its two characters have been removed from the everyday sounds that surround them, so the viewer is unaware of what they are saying. Boy meets girl in a world where verbal communication is inaudible. This is an experimental short filled with a strange, solitary sadness, just as if you had wandered into someone else’s dream.
