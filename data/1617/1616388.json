Despite a sudden onset of strange neurological symptoms in his twenties that stifled his big-city musical dreams, Hal carved out a career as a folk singer, multi-instrumentalist and music educator in his charming hometown of Kent, Ohio. After an inexplicable downturn of mysterious symptoms in 2021, Hal’s music life was shuttered to the confines of his home. Within these limitations, he traverses through his complicated past as a son of a preacher, an addict and a divorced father to his only daughter, Hallie. An honest portrait of a flawed person with extraordinary talent, Living in a Body is a rare humanization of a man trying to survive an impossible circumstance where every action, every feeling has permanent, devastating consequences.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/jJr7t7fqdMTdVjKi1cnlQAyFf1j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Living in a Body","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5939371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hal Walker","original_name":"Hal Walker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6967f8f0bf7345b4b29e8dfa","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4103252,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elanor Nadorff","original_name":"Elanor Nadorff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6967f8c83b3de987fac5d5b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jJr7t7fqdMTdVjKi1cnlQAyFf1j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
