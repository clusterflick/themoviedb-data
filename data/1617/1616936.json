Live From Mexico City","overview":"Norwegian alt-pop artist AURORA, plays her biggest ever headline performance at Mexico City’s Palacio de los Deportes as part of her What Happened To The Earth? Tour.  Filmed on Dia De Los Muertos (Day Of The Dead), the arena is transformed into a space of spellbinding sound and light, and filled with fans in festive dress. AURORA’s ethereal voice is ever-captivating as she sings haunting ballads including Dreams and Exist for Love as well as fan-favourites Runaway, The Seed and Churchyard. Known for blending electronic pop with folk and vivid storytelling, AURORA’s performances are always immersive and emotional, and this concert – celebrating nature and the human experience – solidifies her as a beacon of originality and inspiration.","popularity":0.0786,"poster_path":"/fYShYKxsa8ZiMkPkbjiVoKnD9jV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139109,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trafalgar Releasing","origin_country":""},{"id":178150,"logo_path":"/aWXC584uLR18zZQZHsuqJnodwSg.png","name":"Mercury Studios","origin_country":"US"},{"id":12700,"logo_path":"/1oyIA1tQWgAbARPsqMFUUjESRpB.png","name":"Warner Music Group","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"AURORA: What Happened to the Earth?
