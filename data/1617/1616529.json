As the soul of the Hoka Theater, Ronzo built more than a venue — he created a sanctuary for misfits, where music, films, poetry, and progressive ideas flourished. The Hoka became a launching pad for writers, artists, and musicians, including celebrated figures like John Grisham, Barry Hannah, Willie Morris, and the North Mississippi Allstars. It was a space where students from the University of Mississippi mingled with locals, blues legend Bobby Rush brought the house down, and counterculture icons like Abbie Hoffman and Allen Ginsberg passed through.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/i720yqJjk2ZqcEyq1S5yotQwDJ8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ronzo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5939860,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jon Brick","original_name":"Jon Brick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69683df078b6becc6adbcd80","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5939860,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jon Brick","original_name":"Jon Brick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69683e06599f190718e70d90","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5939860,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jon Brick","original_name":"Jon Brick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69683e228d4492c17bf406ed","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i720yqJjk2ZqcEyq1S5yotQwDJ8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
