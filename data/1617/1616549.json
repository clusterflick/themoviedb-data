Speller, Braids presents the familiar act of hair braiding as a gesture of intergenerational care. The video features two young girls—one Black, one Indigenous-each having her hair braided by an adult representing an older sibling, mother, or aunt. The work honors hair braiding as a tradition and an everyday expression of love, identity, and memory within both Black and Native cultures.\r In the audio track, the artists ask their mothers questions about hair and home. Their stories illustrate the distinct yet interconnected ways in which colonization has impacted both communities.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Braids","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
