This time the center of gravity is shifted to the narrative, and the relationships between the mother, daughter and absent father are explored. But what are “mother,” “daughter,” and “father”? These labels of self endlessly waver in the spaces between the polyphonic monologues and the multiple layers of image and sound. Loss of the family is shown in silhouette. A dance using stage equipment is projected on a scrim. Images presented in silence in the previous work are fleshed out with synchronized sound, and the mysterious group Wangel are now in a talkie . This might be a dream that orphans saw when they were dancing.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/bK9vuJlPHv03vUmiisVA9OWXn3a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Another Side / Salome’s Daughter – Remix","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1155124,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kei Shichiri","original_name":"七里圭","popularity":0.18,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6967e741f22eac13e7c5d5e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1284,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bK9vuJlPHv03vUmiisVA9OWXn3a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":856}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
