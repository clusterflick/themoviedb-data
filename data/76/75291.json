This show earned Mr. Mason a special Tony award for outstanding theatrical achievement in 1989 as well as his first Outer Critics Circle Award, ACE Award, Emmy Award, and Grammy nomination. Once in a generation a performer emerges who is so extraordinary and so brilliant that everyone else in the field is measured against them. Jackie Mason is such a performer, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest stand-up comics of all time.","popularity":0.2717,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1988-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jackie Mason: The World According to Me!","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"On Location: Jackie Mason on Broadway","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackie Mason","original_name":"Jackie Mason","popularity":0.2211,"profile_path":"/7MvjlJMLKDt5o2m9Rsu4CkW1SSx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe48fac3a368484e1147b9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackie Mason","original_name":"Jackie Mason","popularity":0.2211,"profile_path":"/7MvjlJMLKDt5o2m9Rsu4CkW1SSx.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48fac3a368484e1147b5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79469,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dwight Hemion","original_name":"Dwight Hemion","popularity":0.2012,"profile_path":"/m4Iz1nbvYz1ruEbV6Wb7DMbMyaL.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48fac3a368484e1147af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1002472","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
