The players in this story are everyone from villagers to George W. Bush,  Condoleezza Rice, Barack Obama, peace activists and lobbyists representing American  arms manufacturers. Can the Mayor of Trokavec (population 80) take the US on? CZECH PEACE shows the workings of geopolitics and the way they affect the little people.  The personal clashes with the impersonal, the specifc with the universal, and an individual  with the so-called great history.","popularity":0.694,"poster_path":"/tyCgu936lzOgOyBgAOQhLnIG4Ih.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8655,"logo_path":"/iy3xGixP7KGlZ6eNgsDv28DXBOl.png","name":"Hypermarket Film","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2010-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"From the makers of legendary CZECH DREAM, comes the big story of STAR  WARS, the COLD WAR and the WAR ON TERROR all coming to a head in a small  Czech village.","title":"Czech Peace","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":574389,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vít Klusák","original_name":"Vít Klusák","popularity":0.0827,"profile_path":"/7RDYb4TDygwFUv1Ef0LQbtap3TU.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48fac3a368484e114617","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":441778,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filip Remunda","original_name":"Filip Remunda","popularity":0.1412,"profile_path":"/ypMRhjfGgMZ0MCIkdba61bsyfui.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48fac3a368484e114611","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1439897,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michal Gábor","original_name":"Michal Gábor","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca9ae69c3a3683f526109c3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":574389,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vít Klusák","original_name":"Vít Klusák","popularity":0.0827,"profile_path":"/7RDYb4TDygwFUv1Ef0LQbtap3TU.jpg","credit_id":"5ca9ae259251415654ff8569","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2283157,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Nagy","original_name":"David Nagy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca9ae929251411467ff2f93","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":441778,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filip Remunda","original_name":"Filip Remunda","popularity":0.1412,"profile_path":"/ypMRhjfGgMZ0MCIkdba61bsyfui.jpg","credit_id":"5ca9ae17c3a3683f456103c5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":574389,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vít Klusák","original_name":"Vít Klusák","popularity":0.0827,"profile_path":"/7RDYb4TDygwFUv1Ef0LQbtap3TU.jpg","credit_id":"5ca9aedac3a368502c5e3059","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1026854,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Petr Marek","original_name":"Petr Marek","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":"/xTgg4tbba5UPJayoLqRBLpnBFWu.jpg","credit_id":"5ca9af13c3a3683f52610bcb","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":574389,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vít Klusák","original_name":"Vít Klusák","popularity":0.0827,"profile_path":"/7RDYb4TDygwFUv1Ef0LQbtap3TU.jpg","credit_id":"5ca9ae08c3a3683f48611a69","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1532926","wikidata_id":"Q11293895","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kBktF87PaWkkMXrdDso599frglt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"cs","file_path":"/tyCgu936lzOgOyBgAOQhLnIG4Ih.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1416,"iso_639_1":"cs","file_path":"/vVrdvDf79neKGNQmwl8tOAdepMn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":6057,"name":"peace"},{"id":2810,"name":"anti-globalisation activist"},{"id":155170,"name":"inspiring story"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Traverse City Film Festival","release_date":"2010-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"DOBRÝ DEN, PRAPORE Z HVĚZD A PRUHŮ","key":"zaP3jyANFl0","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Featurette","official":true,"published_at":"2009-03-03T13:05:51.000Z","id":"5dd7d7a3439be100122b89d7"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"ČESKÝ MÍR TEASER 4 MIN CZ","key":"61TbbRx3Tr8","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2009-03-03T03:40:13.000Z","id":"5dd7d7b6439be100102b89cc"}]}}}
