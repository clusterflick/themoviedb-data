Davis takes his audience through a side-splitting, roller coaster riot of subjects ranging from The Hood to Hollywood, as well as hood-rats and heaven. From relationships gone bad to rappers gone rogue, nothing is too taboo and no one is safe from the knock-out power punches that only DeRay The Difference can deliver. Filmed in front of a sold-out audience at the Best Buy Theater in New York s Times Square, Power Play is DeRay's best uncensored performance to-date and will surely be regarded as a classic among the comedy greats.","popularity":0.2315,"poster_path":"/1uiaSxiz4wv2IeuuhWcHAJlyVw4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35327,"logo_path":"/oQk0VMjBQt4ldzWinHG78No7ycn.png","name":"Codeblack Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deray Davis:  Power Play","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"DeRay Davis","original_name":"DeRay Davis","popularity":0.5587,"profile_path":"/c1kNORRWnzOoBRTM0XLIMe2raGo.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4918c3a368484e119e57","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":559968,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leslie Small","original_name":"Leslie Small","popularity":0.2465,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5485ce4fc3a3686767001790","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"DeRay Davis","original_name":"DeRay Davis","popularity":0.5587,"profile_path":"/c1kNORRWnzOoBRTM0XLIMe2raGo.jpg","credit_id":"5485ce65c3a3680b36003610","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1396550,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sylvia V.
