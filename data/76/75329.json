His world is turned upside down upon meeting a charismatic and inspirational professor at a garden party, who demonstrates to Stephen and his friends what life would be like if they themselves were merely one, or two, dimensional beings. He then proceeds to explain that by manipulating other dimensions, time travel may actually be possible. As Stephen’s life unfolds, events lead him to dedicate himself to turning the Professor’s theories of time travel into reality. Jealousy, love, obsession, temptation and greed surround him, influencing his fragile mind and the direction of his work.","popularity":1.3398,"poster_path":"/2XoGZzsKcqnQ6fv1PAEq4lv0UUy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17884,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sculptures of Dazzling
