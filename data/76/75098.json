Reiniger began her career in Germany, making The Adventures of Prince Achmed, one of the first and most ingenious full-length animated films in the history of cinema. After the war, she moved to Britain with her husband Carl Koch and made short films for the GPO and later, in collaboration with Primrose Productions, an extensive series of famous fairy tale short films. This is a DVD collection of her work.","popularity":0.1433,"poster_path":"/vsjDHSXs80FJGGUD7qzijMn7NSD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2008-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":192,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lotte Reiniger: The Fairy Tale Films","video":true,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Lotte Reiniger The Fairy Tale Films","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":549834,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lotte Reiniger","original_name":"Lotte Reiniger","popularity":0.137,"profile_path":"/tHompQjOe14o9WvImnIw4qGSAMj.jpg","credit_id":"5b155b3d9251417862009d06","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pz3TXUZOJkws4wp2weW1yo4zUeW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d4DtbAPhyfjtGTBlrDtCRM4ddDu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vsjDHSXs80FJGGUD7qzijMn7NSD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1377,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9aarqlMkKrFS4VhP05afdMoZKHR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":918},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sw9bJ2hUKGhsbQvigypfc53Dipg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3205,"name":"fairy tale"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD","release_date":"2008-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
