His duties include protecting mill owners from restless workers who are on the verge of strike or outright revolt. Meanwhile, Sharpe's faithless wife and her lover fall within range of Sharpe's wrath.

workers.","popularity":2.0215,"poster_path":"/1gSrftajShSSvLvRztIDIOyL9mC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7783,"logo_path":"/gXDRmyPivfsS5jVAoDdrbhpdyk7.png","name":"Celtic Films
