Vic falls for gorgeous blonde Wendy (Carol Lynley). The film's title refers to the name of his speakeasy, and to his gang, which consists of himself, Wendy, and a brace comic-relief hoodlums. The Four Deuces opens with cartoon credits, and attempts a stylish comic strip look. Expecting some wit upon seeing the name Don Martin in the credits will drive you stark raving nuts - this is not the cartoonist who worked for \"Mad\" magazine. Light bondage and female flesh scenes might have upped ratings for those 1980s \"Late Late Show\" airings. Perhaps most notable is the that Ms. Lynley and Mr. Berlinger worked much more memorably together in the stage and film versions of Blue Denim","popularity":1.645,"poster_path":"/2bK5wJA2Buwm021CCJ3iUlWk5o6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114233,"logo_path":null,"name":"AmeriEuro Pictures Corp","origin_country":""},{"id":494,"logo_path":"/ioc65azmsAeL1XQN4dFnrpdJoMO.png","name":"AVCO Embassy Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1975-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Four Deuces","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Palance","original_name":"Jack Palance","popularity":1.0413,"profile_path":"/fna5JPJcX6JnDDzpIypAYP8a3Mk.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Vic Morono, the Boss","credit_id":"52fe48fec3a368484e11535d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":7504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carol Lynley","original_name":"Carol Lynley","popularity":0.7848,"profile_path":"/kIs3zLyRkIFvcsWXlOzoExx4UDI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Wendy Rittenhouse, the Girlfriend","credit_id":"52fe48fec3a368484e115361","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Warren Berlinger","original_name":"Warren Berlinger","popularity":0.3258,"profile_path":"/cyQbiCXyWsHNSQa2OLRjgBpn4Ip.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Chico Hamilton, the Arch Rival","credit_id":"52fe48fec3a368484e115365","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Roarke","original_name":"Adam Roarke","popularity":0.1871,"profile_path":"/2FkXBHNz5kdO5LZ7nlwCZaudRcz.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Russ Timmons - the Reporter","credit_id":"5cdc348e9251416b5bd0e427","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gianni Russo","original_name":"Gianni Russo","popularity":0.7896,"profile_path":"/jfeGnQfXMzKXsuSPm9oTxm6FOuz.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Chip Morono - the 'Deuce of Clubs'","credit_id":"5cdc34a90e0a264c87cc350c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"H.B.
