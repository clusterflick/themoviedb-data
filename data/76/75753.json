He's a slob, she's controlling. She works too much, he won't get a job. Time goes by... They both want out, finally something they can agree on! But at the end of every relationship there's that one awkward moment. That time when when you're forced to face each other, maybe at a restaurant, the dry cleaner or maybe the old apartment. And sometimes you ponder the obvious and tey to figure out exactly What Went Wrong ... and maybe, just maybe, you'll discover everything that went right.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/prsWzuxOmnJLIQgOPc0rvLjsLe4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7840,"logo_path":"/lapCUo8VFaazEMzQkutsLOOYlPs.png","name":"Wicked","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sometimes you ponder the obvious and tey to figure out exactly What Went Wrong...","title":"What Went Wrong","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":99803,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stormy Daniels","original_name":"Stormy Daniels","popularity":66.426,"profile_path":"/4fpNrQzQLA0luPvToFLYr7w9BiB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Vicki","credit_id":"52fe4910c3a368484e118cd3","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":124972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexis Texas","original_name":"Alexis Texas","popularity":37.083,"profile_path":"/6qmipP5hOfPTsAVTCmFPENCT4ZF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Neighbor","credit_id":"52fe4910c3a368484e118cd7","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":132381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tori Black","original_name":"Tori Black","popularity":50.107,"profile_path":"/41PZjviG3CuLDFTt3DISIjyA9LD.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Inga","credit_id":"52fe4910c3a368484e118cdb","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":136332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kagney Linn Karter","original_name":"Kagney Linn Karter","popularity":57.724,"profile_path":"/8TxTXSSDhDyjRurllfR5ogy1LGb.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Girl on Couch","credit_id":"52fe4910c3a368484e118cdf","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":136937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Rosano","original_name":"Anthony Rosano","popularity":2.71,"profile_path":"/ksifM8qjC3Muinze24Wx5LZDyM5.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Neighbor","credit_id":"52fe4910c3a368484e118ce3","order":4},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":131979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcus London","original_name":"Marcus London","popularity":2.881,"profile_path":"/2b7W8NnSiMlGNNxNuaTLk6tCmJF.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Michael","credit_id":"52fe4910c3a368484e118ce7","order":5},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":116457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rocco Reed","original_name":"Rocco Reed","popularity":3.175,"profile_path":"/49DOUigYjI2Rs1liWHzl2rLoJxG.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Guy on Couch","credit_id":"52fe4910c3a368484e118ceb","order":6},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":132343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sascha","original_name":"Sascha","popularity":0.98,"profile_path":"/nXxGkbkW1sxQ9Hg8OICsidIFlif.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Teacher's Assistant","credit_id":"52fe4910c3a368484e118cef","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":140399,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Morgan","original_name":"Jonathan Morgan","popularity":1.908,"profile_path":"/tkFSElHNdYnZhtn101YSsDiFh2v.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4910c3a368484e118cc9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":140399,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Morgan","original_name":"Jonathan Morgan","popularity":1.908,"profile_path":"/tkFSElHNdYnZhtn101YSsDiFh2v.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4910c3a368484e118ccf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1600110","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.619,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/prsWzuxOmnJLIQgOPc0rvLjsLe4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":557}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NC-17","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-02-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
