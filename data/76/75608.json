The Dani people, whom Gardner identifies mysteriously as \"a mountain people,\" believe that there was once a great race between a bird and a snake, which was to determine the lives of human beings. Should men shed their skins and live forever like snakes, or die like birds? The bird won the race, dictating that man must die. The film's plot revolves around two characters, Weyak and Pua. Weyak is a warrior who guards the frontier between the land of his tribe and that of the neighboring tribe. Pua is a young boy whom Gardner depicts as weak and inept.","popularity":0.7285,"poster_path":"/wPmfQlZbqQgCU66pGVVBhoEb0DM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79427,"logo_path":null,"name":"Peabody Museum","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PG","name":"Papua New Guinea"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1963-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dead Birds","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1601664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Gardner","original_name":"Robert Gardner","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"59d7b25dc3a36862000132fa","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1601664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Gardner","original_name":"Robert Gardner","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5704afc4c3a3683ef8000ce0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1601664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Gardner","original_name":"Robert Gardner","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59d7b167c3a3686227011bae","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1901176,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jairus Lincoln","original_name":"Jairus Lincoln","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59d7b1b9c3a36861ec012c6b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1601664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Gardner","original_name":"Robert Gardner","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59d7b16fc3a3686227011bc5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1601664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Gardner","original_name":"Robert Gardner","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59d7b161c3a36862000130cd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1901175,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Rockefeller","original_name":"Michael Rockefeller","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59d7b19dc3a3686200013155","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":146150,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joyce Chopra","original_name":"Joyce Chopra","popularity":0.1699,"profile_path":"/grMXQuW4BxM0IRdoid4mjVLuWwp.jpg","credit_id":"59d7b1cac3a3686227011c8c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1901178,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Peter Chermayeff","original_name":"Peter Chermayeff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59d7b20e925141252c012586","department":"Art","job":"Title Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0059091","wikidata_id":"Q1936875","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aiY332gJcT9IAsSFQxwmeY6PYHS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.682,"height":1143,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wPmfQlZbqQgCU66pGVVBhoEb0DM.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":780},{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/87Qg6IilyV2OlcHsj9s7nxzXcKH.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":836},{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":1778,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oMhw23KxzxFvoN3xirCMLNzIwrp.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1240}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2167,"name":"ethologist"},{"id":193173,"name":"papua new guinea"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1963-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Dead Birds - PREVIEW","key":"CO58Si-u4sI","published_at":"2013-03-20T17:12:52.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"5a69df620e0a260d71012e19"}]}}}
