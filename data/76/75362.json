Over three decades later, up-and-coming young director Kubata Takashi brings a new generation of Hiroshima motorcycle gangsters to the big screen with Badboys. Based on Tanaka Hiroshi’s hit comic series of the same name (which also spawned five animated OVAs in the 1990s), Badboys depicts a violent battle between three rival gangs in the aftermath of a gang-related murder in Osaka. A gripping, exciting gangster action drama starring some of Japan’s brightest young actors, Badboys is the kind of new blood the Japanese gangster genre needs!","popularity":1.3432,"poster_path":"/2XSpKRWuZVgWGsoxxBzlwSLaBTD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9148,"logo_path":"/rtW3NadfF4kR5mTW00ahiFxw6k7.png","name":"Pony Canyon","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":132565,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zenryoku Agency","origin_country":""},{"id":95641,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shonen Gahosha","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2011-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Badboys","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Badboys","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"バッドボーイズ","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1039311,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shinnosuke Abe","original_name":"阿部進之介","popularity":0.5526,"profile_path":"/oa8PhjIOahozCiMA8zMCd9ZC9SS.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"547a98d0c3a36877f00002cd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":235147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoshihiko Hosoda","original_name":"細田善彦","popularity":0.7019,"profile_path":"/dPG05qmZNGiIhcldQb0Cc9hfiDM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"547a98f4925141298a003c92","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":226738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kazuki Namioka","original_name":"波岡一喜","popularity":0.4398,"profile_path":"/A3xhZlyPTRQ8MqtQNcTm1X8JqkT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"547a9905c3a36803df001848","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shôgo Suzuki","original_name":"鈴木勝吾","popularity":0.2944,"profile_path":"/xjYpv7KEqCxEX5je5tcAoWwFeOU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"547a9918c3a3682aa7000d3f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1186984,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mari Iriki","original_name":"入来茉里","popularity":0.2717,"profile_path":"/tv8RGqoxKHOGUExA77ACo6NrHKW.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"63c0c5f1e16e5a008ac7b982","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1945573,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kenji Utsuki","original_name":"Kenji Utsuki","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a3b08040e0a264cc420ff0f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1104256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takashi Kubota","original_name":"Takashi Kubota","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a3b076d925141547e090968","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1945574,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Takashi Kubo","original_name":"Takashi Kubo","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a3b08229251415472091242","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1945572,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hiroshi Tanaka","original_name":"Hiroshi Tanaka","popularity":0.0364,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a3b07b7925141032c21fc71","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3146899,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yoshifumi Yarimizu","original_name":"鎗水善史","popularity":0.0531,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c8bd8df067bcfd6d6e47ab","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1659190","wikidata_id":"Q6414679","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2XSpKRWuZVgWGsoxxBzlwSLaBTD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":535}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":210238,"name":"yankii"},{"id":210239,"name":"furyo"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"F&S Asia Coming Soon: \"Bad Boys\" (Japan)","key":"jej4D77cpC4","published_at":"2011-02-08T06:18:10.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6c6c3a3685448006fb7"}]}}}
