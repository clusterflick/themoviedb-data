Cartier-Bresson pulls out photographs, comments briefly, and holds them up to Bütler's camera. A few others share observations, including Isabelle Huppert, Arthur Miller, and Josef Koudelka. Cartier-Bresson talks about his travels, including Mexico in the 1930s, imprisonment during World War II, being with Gandhi moments before his assassination, and returning to sketching late in life. He shows us examples. He talks about becoming and being a photographer, about composition, and about some of his secrets to capture the moment.","popularity":0.5609,"poster_path":"/qKZxdKhkegav4SYPCs0ZKqoXL5t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Henri Cartier-Bresson: The Impassioned Eye","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":17882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabelle Huppert","original_name":"Isabelle Huppert","popularity":1.4772,"profile_path":"/wGG9v1Uci3sfrbjt0bRXkLrTqjY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56884816c3a3686075023dee","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36208,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arthur Miller","original_name":"Arthur Miller","popularity":0.3305,"profile_path":"/ttjDqWZkHbAWImK2yZq06UFWBVq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5688483c9251417e6300c011","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henri Cartier-Bresson","original_name":"Henri Cartier-Bresson","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/8PoxkduHwvoTlahyhPWpgYZOehK.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5688485b9251414ecb015a97","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1532040,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heinz Bütler","original_name":"Heinz Bütler","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"568847f29251414ecb015a7f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0369523","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pBKsnOpC1VQV9A8tkFORBgrQvE5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kiiRuOjHsoBGl435Z6l1WTB63e6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vcelhHLAogogPoe4V7aT97UaB6r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qKZxdKhkegav4SYPCs0ZKqoXL5t.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/63DeDXQQanWuyN3OfdiUwiuJgAi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":903},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/n77gZe4vyG2b3q4orEXX5bxjNoP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
