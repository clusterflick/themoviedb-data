And although he's not eighteen, he can't swim, and has never been to camp, he manages to get a job as a camp couselor. But his mother makes him take his younger brother, Sullivan, with him to camp, since she can't look after him while she's working. But camp turns out to be harder than both Ryan and Sullivan thought it would be; and as they fight their battles, they learn about each other, themselves, and what they can do together.","popularity":2.47,"poster_path":"/9E54HRi91wYsP9OyOORMxKdVNbQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12296,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sullivan
