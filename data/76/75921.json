This would be the first time Douglas would take part in this type of interview project. Its flow replicates a meandering day-long conversation that was held between Douglas P. and Darryl Hell at Mindswerve Studio, New York City, in 2004. Their many life experiences in 1970's, 1980's punk rock, made for a fertile ground. Hell's vision for the project was to give Douglas a chance to fully articulate himself without the boundaries of the traditional interview format. The result is a roller coaster ride through Douglas' life from childhood into the future.","popularity":0.1042,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Death In June: Behind The Mask","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":577212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Douglas Pierce","original_name":"Douglas Pierce","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1000,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe491cc3a368484e11abb9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":577214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Murphy","original_name":"John Murphy","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1001,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe491cc3a368484e11abbd","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4824399,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Darryl Hell","original_name":"Darryl Hell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66900da076edda3c2ff228c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4824403,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sara Schetter","original_name":"Sara Schetter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66900e0ceafe123d33f22850","department":"Crew","job":"Lighting Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1808100,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Wolfgang Busch","original_name":"Wolfgang Busch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66900dec2f3be4bcdd1f54f9","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4824399,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Darryl Hell","original_name":"Darryl Hell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66900dabf307020b2e181833","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hztX3MW8sUXL5jZHigiWY1X9WWW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
