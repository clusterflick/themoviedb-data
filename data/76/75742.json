When his parents (Carl Betz and Vera Miles) balk, he talks them into joining him in traveling the country and educating themselves about the state of things. They, along with Grandma (Ruth McDevitt) trick out an old Greyhound bus and hit the road. The picaresque plotline brings the family into contact with a variety of colorful characters. The producers of In Search of America never declared outright that the made-for-TV film was intended as a series pilot, but it ends on an ambiguous note with plenty of loose plot ends. In Search of America was first telecast March 23, 1971.","popularity":0.2238,"poster_path":"/pALrprsU3xrqBSPsH8vrWOF2zhW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19746,"logo_path":null,"name":"Four Stars Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1971-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Search of America","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Betz","original_name":"Carl Betz","popularity":0.4916,"profile_path":"/v2azQL7807RwKx94Ohkztca1Pls.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ben Olson","credit_id":"52fe4910c3a368484e118a83","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":7303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vera Miles","original_name":"Vera Miles","popularity":1.0845,"profile_path":"/ke0e0i8RkzGfTixKk6nuh6HuQkz.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Jenny Olson","credit_id":"52fe4910c3a368484e118ab3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Bridges","original_name":"Jeff Bridges","popularity":2.025,"profile_path":"/xms1RAY6q7Lzp7wNeRCB0kzhucn.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mike Olson","credit_id":"52fe4910c3a368484e118a87","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":85833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth McDevitt","original_name":"Ruth McDevitt","popularity":0.2067,"profile_path":"/4mPxaegx2KjdUbMS17Z7uRxuara.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Grandma Rose","credit_id":"609b1ead54a0980029e6b701","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":161341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renne Jarrett","original_name":"Renne Jarrett","popularity":0.0826,"profile_path":"/xj80kzZCSWTEcJrVSCeSmg8DmIc.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Kathy","credit_id":"52fe4910c3a368484e118a8b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Howard Duff","original_name":"Howard Duff","popularity":0.6805,"profile_path":"/7LFu95tQM8IRLbSIcsgvfOBwnf2.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Ray Chandler","credit_id":"52fe4910c3a368484e118a8f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Hunter","original_name":"Kim Hunter","popularity":0.9276,"profile_path":"/knu87rUxQVZ65Plp6BgoyasAHOT.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Cora Chandler","credit_id":"52fe4910c3a368484e118a93","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sal Mineo","original_name":"Sal Mineo","popularity":0.8358,"profile_path":"/glfs6BXlFIMprrJSuiT74VzJIOJ.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Nick","credit_id":"52fe4910c3a368484e118a9b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Anderson Jr.","original_name":"Michael Anderson Jr.","popularity":0.4902,"profile_path":"/v6TqyJmAerCz8PpYGx9PrD3qSL.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"J.J.","credit_id":"52fe4910c3a368484e118a97","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":66221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tyne Daly","original_name":"Tyne Daly","popularity":0.881,"profile_path":"/uR0nx2bniih1Kdhst5R3LH59smk.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Anne","credit_id":"52fe4910c3a368484e118a9f","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glynn Turman","original_name":"Glynn Turman","popularity":0.8108,"profile_path":"/ac5gjylih4RTCGf2HWuSnoZWDus.jpg","cast_id":21,"character":"Bodhi","credit_id":"609b1ee828d7fe00403b1abd","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2033277,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Gilmore","original_name":"Chris Gilmore","popularity":0.0647,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"Girl","credit_id":"609b1f2342022800791a4d0c","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1273694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George D.
