A celebration of friends, their adventures, and the spirit of East Coast Snowboarding. No sponsors, no heli-shots, no HD dollys or crazy special effects. Just a group of homies out of New York who love to shred, and snowboarding captured in its most raw form. Even if the snow is old, brown and crusty.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It's Always Snowing Somewhere Else","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"It's Always Snowing Somewhere Else Teaser","key":"lhu3WsIINbU","published_at":"2009-04-10T13:21:42.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6c6c3a3685448007056"}]}}}
