Describing herself as an old woman, she sends them cheerful letters and baskets of small gifts until one of the soldiers, Harry Ledyard, informs her that he has been released and will visit her in New York. Panic-stricken, Jeanette dons a wig and spectacles, and although she convinces Harry that she is old and gray, she soon falls in love with him. Harry worships his \"godmother,\" and when secret service agents discover coded messages on her letters, he shields her by assuming the blame.","popularity":0.5378,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1307,"logo_path":"/z6FFp0gxKiB2KLS9n3fC8uX6ZcR.png","name":"Triangle Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Flames of Chance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margery Wilson","original_name":"Margery Wilson","popularity":0.1192,"profile_path":"/lEcSh2qIB3tldz7wNPKU8qd87MS.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jeanette Gontreau","credit_id":"62e021b8481382004cbd8e4d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mulhall","original_name":"Jack Mulhall","popularity":0.3,"profile_path":"/4r33PICmACJZ2Bjum0v1EkvOxbx.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Harry Ledyard","credit_id":"62e021c733a533051fba653b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":150178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Dodge","original_name":"Anna Dodge","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":"/6gjFkcwkKKag9gKPjSvYIOhjUcf.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mrs. Ribbits","credit_id":"62e021d9e9da69149541e0cc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gino Corrado","original_name":"Gino Corrado","popularity":0.2657,"profile_path":"/f4FxGEcWMoRcBbArEvYCxy7QSk7.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Anatole","credit_id":"62e0222d33a533051fba656c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Phelps","original_name":"Lee Phelps","popularity":0.6567,"profile_path":"/vCmf8eRDjbj7o5yvFU4w6CAId6k.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Paul","credit_id":"62e0223e55bc35027d40d3b7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William V.
