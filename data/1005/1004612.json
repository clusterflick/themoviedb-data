Several critics saw in Albertine Proust’s driver Alfred Agostinelli, a young Italian with whom Proust had been madly in love. The novel and Proust’s life become the excuse for a contemporary love story – where Marcel, Albertine and Alfred hide, bluff, swap genders and roles, experiencing love as an eternal question, aware that the heart of things cannot be captured, but only glimpsed at.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/p0L5CtBFCbiDhladrqiJQOychWX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":182159,"logo_path":"/hWbdYJW26HLpyrpdroXXCKNGOoD.png","name":"Guidone Apulia
