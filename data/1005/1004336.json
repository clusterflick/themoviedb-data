Portia's father has died and left a very strange will: only the man that picks the correct casket out of three (silver, gold, and lead) can marry her. Bassanio, unfortunately, is strapped for cash with which to go wooing, and Antonio wants to help, so Antonio borrows the money from Shylock, the money-lender. But Shylock has been nursing a grudge against Antonio's insults, and makes unusual terms to the loan. And when Antonio's business fails, those terms threaten his life, and it's up to Bassanio and Portia to save him.","popularity":0.1166,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1919-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Merchant of Venice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6210,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William Shakespeare","original_name":"William Shakespeare","popularity":0.5039,"profile_path":"/60ZqefTZIgfGtklgihIjXmi4ClH.jpg","credit_id":"62dec022ea84c714e6fb9c72","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187708,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anson Dyer","original_name":"Anson Dyer","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62dec0161dbc88067447c2f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3298156","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1919-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
