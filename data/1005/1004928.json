The piece, originally made in 2010 in collaboration with Abigail Severance, was remixed for Visual AIDS in 2014. Tolentino's self-made sound piece was added and initiates the video with a queer list of loved ones living and lost, recognizable or not, as both invocation and provocation of individuals who deeply shifted her perspective. As the listed names blur and are archived in Tolentino's body, evidence opens up to the list's potency through a female, brown, artist/activist body in the unseen yet held spaces of relationship, memory, sex and loss.  Commissioned by Visual AIDS in 2014 as part of ALTERNATE ENDINGS, a program of seven videos that bring together charged moments and personal memories amidst the public history of HIV/AIDS.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/pL3GaDoh2pgufGARLknTvaRoReS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139738,"logo_path":null,"name":"Visual AIDS","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Evidence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2013625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julie Tolentino","original_name":"Julie Tolentino","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e04676e9da691496f3de9a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1194823,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Abigail Severance","original_name":"Abigail Severance","popularity":0.0036,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e046bdbbcae000557926f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5080451,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Visual AIDS","original_name":"Visual AIDS","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674a1bdfb72de59123ee2407","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8315926","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pL3GaDoh2pgufGARLknTvaRoReS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
