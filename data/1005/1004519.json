The films have been directed by a selection of young directors and blend existing Shakespeare's Globe footage with new material shot in locations that capture the breadth of the Bard's imagination, including the Pyramids of Dahshur in Egypt, the rocks of Elsinore, Denmark, and the historic Jewish Ghetto of Venice, Italy. “Romeo and Juliet”, which starred Jessie Buckley as Juliet, was filmed at Juliet's Tomb, Verona.","popularity":0.8356,"poster_path":"/fde3r78cejP8dP56bftzGTZRVF1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Shakespeare's Globe invites the world to join The Complete Walk.","title":"The Complete Walk: Romeo and Juliet","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1498158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessie Buckley","original_name":"Jessie Buckley","popularity":1.8746,"profile_path":"/jKhDQOMVQ1JP4gaUXCQg75gvsrm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Juliet","credit_id":"62df2f0a1dbc88067447edf8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luke Thompson","original_name":"Luke Thompson","popularity":0.827,"profile_path":"/nPNXCTpvBsnVILldwjVcDK4yrby.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Romeo","credit_id":"62df2f155aba32005d1c7ce0","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1287083,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dominic Dromgoole","original_name":"Dominic Dromgoole","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62df2f261a32480069940785","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2672845,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jessica Lusk","original_name":"Jessica Lusk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62df305fbbcae0004dca105f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6210,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William Shakespeare","original_name":"William Shakespeare","popularity":0.5039,"profile_path":"/60ZqefTZIgfGtklgihIjXmi4ClH.jpg","credit_id":"64c3884e1d1bf400e56971fa","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6352700","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pRP3PsLWuvh0w9aO42X6WfTEAdx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":930,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fde3r78cejP8dP56bftzGTZRVF1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":620}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
