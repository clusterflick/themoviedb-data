Voice is not needed. Yes there are sounds, music, but not human voices, as in primitive cinema. There are faces, slow or fast movements, despair, fatality, a barely glimpsed horror, desire and fear of freedom. There is also love, perhaps as an illusion, rather than as a reality.","popularity":0.2444,"poster_path":"/1HQCOG6Sw2meDhUQKIXmi0mrZwS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205083,"logo_path":"/drHzrTQ5BR128p78i86FrBaXlLG.png","name":"El Colchón
