The film lays bare the ‘banality of evil’ and is devastatingly relevant today, as Ukrainian people are once again being subjected to the violence of barbarian invaders.","popularity":0.1884,"poster_path":"/tYu0dXVPPwrtO1c91f29xPqG1sN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109618,"logo_path":"/hHgwcVNXh3WE1UbtIOu8EcU7j3d.png","name":"Atoms & Void","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2022-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kiev Trial","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Київський процес","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Kiev Trial","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"LT","title":"SCA'22: Kyjivo procesas","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":543674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergei Loznitsa","original_name":"Sergei Loznitsa","popularity":0.1481,"profile_path":"/gxs4Qqw5DjgbChJNU9cZ3UkK9Vw.jpg","credit_id":"62dfceb333a533051e0bd91b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":927436,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Danielius Kokanauskis","original_name":"Danielius Kokanauskis","popularity":0.0592,"profile_path":"/pw94GSlRoD9G7BJAfVragQAekpT.jpg","credit_id":"636f940d1684f700dd946980","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1571207,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomasz Wolski","original_name":"Tomasz Wolski","popularity":0.099,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636f9405ca4f6700c68d863c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":543674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergei Loznitsa","original_name":"Sergei Loznitsa","popularity":0.1481,"profile_path":"/gxs4Qqw5DjgbChJNU9cZ3UkK9Vw.jpg","credit_id":"636f93f1172d7f0092da7601","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238623,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vladimir Golovnitsky","original_name":"Vladimir Golovnitsky","popularity":0.0832,"profile_path":"/l31CZDOz3llbpOHVBM38kI1Ov5w.jpg","credit_id":"636f9416172d7f00ced4421c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":543674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergei Loznitsa","original_name":"Sergei Loznitsa","popularity":0.1481,"profile_path":"/gxs4Qqw5DjgbChJNU9cZ3UkK9Vw.jpg","credit_id":"636f93eb81383100dd369a5f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":543674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergei Loznitsa","original_name":"Sergei Loznitsa","popularity":0.1481,"profile_path":"/gxs4Qqw5DjgbChJNU9cZ3UkK9Vw.jpg","credit_id":"636f93e52495ab007821af9d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1887988,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maria Choustova","original_name":"Maria Choustova","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636f93fdd7fbda00bb90107c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21376884","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vZxitcXFAJM0GC9p6mAQtnn52rW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":788,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xHziNG7Oq8JrF4anRuwBtjMmAtX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":788,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iiXGnd5190KSi1sD7COpGPWRxx2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":788,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2RGInxLIXfQQpfdMtidZfSZZGhs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tYu0dXVPPwrtO1c91f29xPqG1sN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/invHOjh3Caq7lF8joQagfQXZX2b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":525}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DMZ International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2022-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"N-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"SCANORAMA'22","release_date":"2022-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
