The unmistakable voice, filled with raw emotion and tinged with Southern Comfort, made her a must-see headliner from Monterey to Woodstock. From Broadway to your screen, now you’re invited to share an evening with the woman and her influences in the musical, A NIGHT WITH JANIS JOPLIN. Fueled by such unforgettable songs as “Me and Bobby McGee,” “Piece of My Heart,” “Mercedes Benz,” “Cry Baby” and “Summertime,” a remarkable cast and breakout performances, A NIGHT WITH JANIS JOPLIN, written and directed by Randy Johnson, is a musical journey celebrating Janis and her biggest musical influences—icons like Aretha Franklin, Etta James, Odetta, Nina Simone and Bessie Smith, who inspired one of rock & roll’s greatest legends.","popularity":0.552,"poster_path":"/i6JryG6gsmGuqBEEz8MeC1z1M61.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103196,"logo_path":"/eA1H91t6I1NHTsyDnmEDsk7BZbD.png","name":"BroadwayHD","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A night with a legend","title":"A Night with Janis Joplin","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3637195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aurianna Angelique","original_name":"Aurianna Angelique","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Odetta","credit_id":"62dee746bbcae0004dc9f6f2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":228686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamar Davis","original_name":"Tamar Davis","popularity":0.1077,"profile_path":"/opskniaZS4aVZB1FWj97OxUF8Xw.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Aretha Franklin (as Ashley Tamar Davis)","credit_id":"62dee7661dbc88067447d418","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3637196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Bridget Davies","original_name":"Mary Bridget Davies","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Janis Joplin","credit_id":"62dee77c1dbc880673158e07","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3637197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tawny Dolley","original_name":"Tawny Dolley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/2zuTtC37Jd9L4PoLPjprEUpCta1.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Etta James","credit_id":"62dee78a1dbc880672cfa9ff","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":91850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Leigh Warren","original_name":"Jennifer Leigh Warren","popularity":0.2062,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Blues Singer","credit_id":"62dee79bea84c714e7e89475","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":217776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Horn","original_name":"David Horn","popularity":0.2116,"profile_path":"/imYeAGs6NJYPhP3QEmKRaON0NRY.jpg","credit_id":"62dee7b0238513005090b804","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3637198,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Randy Johnson","original_name":"Randy Johnson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62dee7bfe9da691496f32e31","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":993618,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bonnie Comley","original_name":"Bonnie Comley","popularity":0.1457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62dee7cd23bcf4004d533a4f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":217776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Horn","original_name":"David Horn","popularity":0.2116,"profile_path":"/imYeAGs6NJYPhP3QEmKRaON0NRY.jpg","credit_id":"62dee7da1dbc88067447d43f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1993821,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stewart F.
