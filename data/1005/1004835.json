The process triangulates mother (Chloe), lover (Kelly), and child (Viva) in a deliberate ritual to uplift the spirit and legacy of an ancestral teacher. Through artifacts from the moment when video first became accessible and before mobile phone cameras became ubiquitous, we witness Chloe declare herself and her sisters as leaders in art, advocacy and culture for evermore.  Commissioned by Visual AIDS in 2019 as part of STILL BEGINNING, a program of seven short videos responding to the ongoing HIV/AIDS epidemic.","popularity":0.0407,"poster_path":"/zoGDcPWkb3vYikxMbdDirC0ppoy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139738,"logo_path":null,"name":"Visual AIDS","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chloe Dzubilo: There is a Transolution","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chloe Dzubilo","original_name":"Chloe Dzubilo","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62e040e2681888004d389ba2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3638170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Viva Ruiz","original_name":"Viva Ruiz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e01f2c5aba32005d1d026e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5080451,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Visual AIDS","original_name":"Visual AIDS","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674a15640dc2fdb0523ee7fc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2802,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zoGDcPWkb3vYikxMbdDirC0ppoy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1868}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
