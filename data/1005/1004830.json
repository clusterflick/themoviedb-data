Through conversation with longterm survivor Patric McCoy, the film traces the height of activity in the 1970s, the downfall of cruising culture in the 1980s, and the prevailing summer heat, which continues to linger. Together, McCoy and Woods-Morrow reflect on their relationship to cruising, to photography, and to each other; attempting to bridge the gap between what was, and what still remains to be explored.  Commissioned by Visual AIDS in 2019 as part of STILL BEGINNING, a program of seven short videos responding to the ongoing HIV/AIDS epidemic.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/1uI6TJpbLvYzFKTjpLUL6kBJ2yt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139738,"logo_path":null,"name":"Visual AIDS","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Much handled things are always soft","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3638157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Derrick Woods-Morrow","original_name":"Derrick Woods-Morrow","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e01d525aba32004d1e60c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5080451,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Visual AIDS","original_name":"Visual AIDS","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674a156b4593a7f05c0138ef","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1uI6TJpbLvYzFKTjpLUL6kBJ2yt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
