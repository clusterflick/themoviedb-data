Patrick heads to San Francisco, where the thriving queer community welcomes him, and where his prodigious and visionary musical talent will take him to the brink of stardom. Lily follows a more seemingly conventional path of marriage and children. Dear Lily, Love Patrick is a poignant look at the power of true connection, a young life ended by tragedy at the onset of the AIDS epidemic, and a love that still endures.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/djjdACxaNNX4XDvQegWkGJF0wWg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dear Lily, Love Patrick","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3637684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lily Bartels","original_name":"Lily Bartels","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"62df8c6b0d9f5a004fc36452","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3637683,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jennifer Bartels","original_name":"Jennifer Bartels","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62df8cbabbcae0004dca3eae","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3637683,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jennifer Bartels","original_name":"Jennifer Bartels","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62df8c3f1dbc880674482185","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/djjdACxaNNX4XDvQegWkGJF0wWg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-07-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
