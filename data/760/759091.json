As no specific cause was identified, there was an immediate torrent of assumptions and speculation. The film uses local children to retell the story.  \"It's based on a true story of mass hysteria in 2015 - pleased to have made it last year as this year it wouldn't be possible to have 29 teenagers in a studio together. A timely re-telling.\" - Alex Culshaw","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/sqVaL3ZRbz5aPNj6rUxcvgYYPCK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ripple","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2836956,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Culshaw","original_name":"Alex Culshaw","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9c557d26dac10036d171ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1333,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sqVaL3ZRbz5aPNj6rUxcvgYYPCK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
