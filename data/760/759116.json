Three disparate elements, then — a female pair, a structure in ruins and a river surrounding Lisbon and winding through the city’s outskirts — lay the foundation for a historical inventory of a military defence line that with time assumed a different role and another meaning. This anachronous defence wall sets a paradox before our eyes — it began as a military defence complex to keep the French from the capital during the invasions at the beginning of the nineteenth century; and now, more than a century later, it’s a territory where a by-and-large African population coming from the Portuguese ex-colonies, established their communities when they found themselves with no means to live in the prosperous, much-desired capital.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/83UoJoir45sCVgUbSEpKJ9NmOp6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"South Circular","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2836986,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mónica de Miranda","original_name":"Mónica de Miranda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9c5eb2f031740039800fa6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/83UoJoir45sCVgUbSEpKJ9NmOp6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Portuguese\", \"english_name\"=>\"Portuguese\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"pt\", \"native_name\"=>\"Portuguese\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
