Their parents are struggling with their own demons and they are bullied at school. Life doesn't seem to offer the two outsiders any perspective either. And so they start planning their revenge on their tormentors and do shooting exercises with the old NVA rifle of Erik's father. Driven by a voice from the swamp, Erik increasingly drifts into the darkness. Only when he meets a young punk girl his world suddenly turn upside down. And so he has to choose between what makes him happy and his dark thoughts, which seem inseparable from his friendship with Sebastian. But in a world of violence, there is inevitably an escalation that will shake the foundations of the small village on the edge of the former German-German border forever.","popularity":0.164,"poster_path":"/mSkoCDqezydp9ekzXKQQvLEBHTK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arboretum","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":569353,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oskar Bökelmann","original_name":"Oskar Bökelmann","popularity":0.1964,"profile_path":"/nyTjObh1yD7Tx5fHcqHV8heDimO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Erik","credit_id":"5f9d8e0ba24232003563db7d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2838195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niklas Doddo","original_name":"Niklas Doddo","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sebastian","credit_id":"5f9d8e1c1511aa0038a48ff0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2384562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Volker Figge","original_name":"Volker Figge","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Eriks Vater","credit_id":"5f9d902e39a45d00361f2fe2","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":2838200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elena Halangk","original_name":"Elena Halangk","popularity":0.661,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Sebastians Mutter","credit_id":"5f9d905039a45d00361f305c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1852946,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anna Jung","original_name":"Anna Jung","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Elli","credit_id":"5f9d905f6350130031578663","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2977195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Mantei","original_name":"Simon Mantei","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/3sX515Kv47i958WI59UYv90VdhJ.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Ronny","credit_id":"64702e4f77070000df13bb95","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2063317,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tobias Krebs","original_name":"Tobias Krebs","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/c33Jp1xiBTEyKafgyni8UacwYKX.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Patrick","credit_id":"64702e629672ed00de70b72e","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2838194,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julian Richberg","original_name":"Julian Richberg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6097fd23356a71003dc8beaa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2838194,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julian Richberg","original_name":"Julian Richberg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9d8e6bbd990c0038471755","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11205640","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/feGqq2MYqFE6SvP4FnxAkF9gcvy.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/afR00cDRpJ2ZxljYIrK8vG0aoTx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":3.461,"height":1157,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kCNiR7bX1XlVpBFOPDQcL6tAnLv.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":4004}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/mSkoCDqezydp9ekzXKQQvLEBHTK.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/y68tOOoYoyT5a9vPwQJpqiHvbuc.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":764,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4fOrbZSwEr4joWwJ8c5WiBCLNln.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":538}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"16","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"German\", \"english_name\"=>\"German\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"de\", \"native_name\"=>\"German\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
