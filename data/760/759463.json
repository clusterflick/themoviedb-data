Working their blue-collar jobs for hours and hours, for over 45 years, their purpose was to return to Spain wealthy and comfortable. There, in a house full of Dutch porcelain and shiny gold, they can now finally rest. Vanesa was raised as Dutch, but still feels trapped in their expectant illusion, even with the distance between them. Torn between two homes, she starts to re-examine her past.","popularity":0.2584,"poster_path":"/akfKbwEgYMDjjBhQqGe3ixuX40Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51184,"logo_path":null,"name":"Basalt Film","origin_country":""},{"id":99613,"logo_path":"/u9a9AizRCLzcDMKqJnAy0uYtCJT.png","name":"KRO-NCRV","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2020-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life Is Dream","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"La vida es sueño","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1182706,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Xander Nijsten","original_name":"Xander Nijsten","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b5ed2260ff276b63a766b4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2845480,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vanesa Abajo Perez","original_name":"Vanesa Abajo Perez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa54c3b43494f003f19cd39","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13144070","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":855,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/akfKbwEgYMDjjBhQqGe3ixuX40Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2200,"name":"generations conflict"},{"id":3371,"name":"family history"},{"id":18035,"name":"family"},{"id":193049,"name":"estrangement"},{"id":226776,"name":"culture shock"},{"id":272598,"name":"migration from spain"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"AL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Spaans; Castiliaans\", \"english_name\"=>\"Spanish\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"es\", \"native_name\"=>\"Spaans; Castiliaans\"}","note":"Documentaire ","release_date":"2020-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
