This short film by Bettim & Coelho pays tribute to Piva in relation to the Brazilian city. A tribute to a poet who is missed, but also a visual and sonic epitome of explosions, nightlife and rock, which is also invoked through the self-portrait, the frantic exploration of the city and its lights.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/e5YLBJsSGH57h1lzRnrGMIpvliv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2018-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Visão 2013 para Roberto Piva","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2023614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Priscyla Bettim","original_name":"Priscyla Bettim","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9d389f1511aa0039a5b406","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2126878,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Renato Coelho","original_name":"Renato Coelho","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9d38bc53866e0037e9e56d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e5YLBJsSGH57h1lzRnrGMIpvliv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Mostra do Filme Livre","release_date":"2018-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Internet","release_date":"2014-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"corrient.es","release_date":"2020-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
