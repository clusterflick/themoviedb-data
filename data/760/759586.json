A small flaw, something imperfect that we seldom consciously direct our attention to. Filmmaker Ondřej Vavrečka finds holes in every corner. His focus is on the imperfections of human existence. A hole can also mean an uncertain future, or an empty stomach. The gap that partners leave behind after a breakup. Ondřej Vavrečka does not only deal with visible holes. He looks at the incomplete from a philosophical perspective. He also lets a nuclear physicist, a theologian and an ethnologist have their say. He underscores their thoughts and theses with absurd everyday scenes: a woman with a chair on her head or an invisible skier. These scenes combine with interviews, sounds and stop-motion sequences to create a playful collage.","popularity":0.1482,"poster_path":"/wLTNjXRK8Ovwt2w14PXdKavaGyG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127505,"logo_path":null,"name":"Silk Films","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2021-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"„A window is a hole in the wall... or in the roof.“","title":"Personal Life of a Hole","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2707691,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alžběta Janáčková","original_name":"Alžběta Janáčková","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9e986e1967570036a0dd83","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2313618,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lucie Navrátilová","original_name":"Lucie Navrátilová","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9e9981bc8abc0038335cea","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2528559,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Simon Todorov","original_name":"Simon Todorov","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9e987af04d010034a1a5c4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2257184,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tomáš Vtípil","original_name":"Tomáš Vtípil","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9e99b21511aa0039a8b90c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2363086,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ondřej Vavrečka","original_name":"Ondřej Vavrečka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9e98642790bf003745012f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2839081,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anna Petruželová","original_name":"Anna Petruželová","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9e98859ee0ef00368360cb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2216339,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Věra Krincvajová","original_name":"Věra Krincvajová","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9e99721967570035a1eedc","department":"Crew","job":"Dramaturgy"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2364821,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jan Richtr","original_name":"Jan Richtr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9e99a95f2db10039267710","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2283331,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zdeněk Hala","original_name":"Zdeněk Hala","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9e99bf7314a1003535a91a","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14510568","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7aYhxUvktArAN2uBrZgyacoV8wi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1kzLU373GNvnDMOdiqiJDReYWO8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eNB5cdJf9QTrSKXIHcq1J48pzur.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1811,"iso_639_1":"cs","file_path":"/wLTNjXRK8Ovwt2w14PXdKavaGyG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1207}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":170487,"name":"essay film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ji.hlava International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2020-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
