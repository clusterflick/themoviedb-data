This self-defined family is assuaged and even inspired by the ghosts who inhabit this home and begin to see their squatting as a matter of destiny and resistance rather than urgent fear.  Combining spoken word, contemporary movement, video projection, classical, R&B and jazz singing, and a brooding, often joyful score filled with place, purpose, and possibility, We Shall Not Be Moved is a timely exploration of past and present struggles which suggests an alternate future through the eyes of its young protagonists.","popularity":0.1601,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":142840,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opera Philadelphia","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Shall Not Be Moved","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2836922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lauren Whitehead","original_name":"Lauren Whitehead","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Un / Sung","credit_id":"5f9c50389ee0ef00397de80b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2642802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kirstin Chávez","original_name":"Kirstin Chávez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Glenda","credit_id":"5f9c505053866e0038e773fc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2235168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Holiday","original_name":"John Holiday","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"John Blue","credit_id":"5f9c5067fdfc9f0036392ea1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2836924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Shirley","original_name":"Daniel Shirley","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"John Little","credit_id":"5f9c5075028f140036916356","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2836926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Richardson","original_name":"Adam Richardson","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":"/oo5KMt7iZ6phQxmvrETeRmkhglU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"John Mack","credit_id":"5f9c508b9ee0ef00367e67fb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2836927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aubrey Allicock","original_name":"Aubrey Allicock","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"John Henry","credit_id":"5f9c50a4028f140038922253","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2836929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael bishop","original_name":"Michael bishop","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"OG","credit_id":"5f9c511efdfc9f0036393069","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2836930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Duane Lee Holland, Jr","original_name":"Duane Lee Holland, Jr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"OG","credit_id":"5f9c5138bc8abc003b2f7da3","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2799845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tendayi Kuumba","original_name":"Tendayi Kuumba","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/tVUa0rNtXZZSTRmyylSAINVCRqo.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"OG","credit_id":"5f9c516e9b6e4700369de342","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2836932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caci Cole Pritchett","original_name":"Caci Cole Pritchett","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"OG","credit_id":"5f9c518e5f2db10039212451","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240800,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bill T.
