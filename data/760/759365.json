The audience is witnessing a film being made as they watch.  61 Scenes, 58 Camera Setups, and everything LIVE - this is definitely not a zoom call. The film tells the story of four twenty-something co-workers, bored with their day jobs and sick of being locked up in isolation, who play a silly online game and unwittingly prove the truth of an urban legend. However, whilst they may not be able to get out, that doesn't mean that something can't get in.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2020-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Shadow It Waits","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2838161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Pham","original_name":"Robert Pham","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f9d821d1511aa0039a61c18","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2838162,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily O'Connor","original_name":"Emily O'Connor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f9d822c028f140033d02967","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2612153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cezar Zamfir","original_name":"Cezar Zamfir","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f9d823b6350130031577287","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2838163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nalanie Wakita","original_name":"Nalanie Wakita","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f9d824563501300305776a7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2838164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"S.C.
