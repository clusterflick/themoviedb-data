The film reveals the dramatic decline of the American interior through a combination of emotional personal stories and thoughtful conservative commentary. Filmmaker Christopher F. Rufo spent five years gathering these intimate portraits of Americans on the edge, including an ex-steelworker scrapping abandoned homes to survive, a recently incarcerated father trying to rebuild his life, and a single mother dreaming of escaping her blighted urban neighborhood. Ultimately, despite these grave challenges, the film offers a glimpse of hope for rebuilding America's families and communities from the bottom up.","popularity":0.0622,"poster_path":"/bfQALSHpa0SG7V8MIxByB2lQJHf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"America Lost","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3531568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Dougherty","original_name":"Michael Dougherty","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"626e650a245dbe338072b2a6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2837626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Rufo","original_name":"Christopher Rufo","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self - Narrator","credit_id":"626e6522245dbe338072b2ae","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2185879,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ford Fischer","original_name":"Ford Fischer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626e64dfa24c5017bc254319","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2837626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Rufo","original_name":"Christopher Rufo","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9cf79e9f5dfb0037282ebc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8151086","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bfQALSHpa0SG7V8MIxByB2lQJHf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
