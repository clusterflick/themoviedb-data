In the first part of the work, Padrissa plays with the present-day meaning of \"Trojans\" as computer viruses: his Trojan horse carries within it the infection that will cause system failures and, ultimately, destruction. In the second part, Carthage is presented as the mysterious seat of a future civilization, where human life is heading towards self-destruction through environmental disasters.","popularity":0.1051,"poster_path":"/yyprwwt3tPq3oTt0td7jyxlQuwn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174190,"logo_path":null,"name":"Palau de les Arts Reina
