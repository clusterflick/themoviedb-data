This short film is a present day look at the life of a young saint who died at the ripe age of 24-- The places he lived and frequented  \"The week before I left for Italy to shoot this film, I realized I did not have nearly enough money to cover the costs of stock and processing. I was spending time with my Grandpa in adoration at Church, when suddenly, after I loaded him up in the car, a small Spanish woman tapped me on the shoulder and gave me an envelope saying, \"Here, this is a gift from God.\" She scampered away, and I opened it, deeply touched, as I pulled out two thousand dollars. I could never find this woman to thank her, though I have looked for her every time I return to that same parish.\" - Jake Hart","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/29O9RlD9tq7v9EeETHQEnM9itGE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"July 4th, 1925","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2836678,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jake Hart","original_name":"Jake Hart","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9c376b5f2db1003720a8b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/29O9RlD9tq7v9EeETHQEnM9itGE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
