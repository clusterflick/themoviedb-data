Offended by the Emperor’s insolence, Death refuses to let anyone die, wreaking havoc throughout the world.  Der Kaiser von Atlantis's origin as the only surviving opera composed in a Nazi concentration camp elevates it to a unique memorial against forgetting. Yet in the Deutsche Oper am Rhein’s production, the parable of living death is never cautionary, but ominous, disturbingly comical and deeply human.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4xgLjPJ0okbc2UXLakXY57x9HOC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ullmann: Der Kaiser von Atlantis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2861889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emmett O’Hanlon","original_name":"Emmett O’Hanlon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5fb63ff8ae3843003de0ebab","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2861890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thorsten Grümbel","original_name":"Thorsten Grümbel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5fb63ffcf29d66003c33a77a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2861891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luke Stoker","original_name":"Luke Stoker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5fb6400268929c003c7832e5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2861892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Fischer","original_name":"David Fischer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5fb6400f091e62004152036b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2861893,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergej Khomov","original_name":"Sergej Khomov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5fb64016ae3843003de0ec9b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2233857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anke Krabbe","original_name":"Anke Krabbe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5fb6401fecbde9003eb3bb04","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2861894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kimberley Boettger-Soller","original_name":"Kimberley Boettger-Soller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5fb640258741c4003e36a1a9","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2861896,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilaria Lanzino","original_name":"Ilaria Lanzino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fb6405719ab590042dfb5d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1654405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Axel Kober","original_name":"Axel Kober","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fb64049ed96bc0041b1f811","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4xgLjPJ0okbc2UXLakXY57x9HOC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
