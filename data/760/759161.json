The film is an intimate poetic window into the lives of the Kondh adivasis in Odisha- who eschew the duality of Man and Nature. The Kondh have internalised the Forest – pacing the rhythms of their lives with the cycle of the seasons. The Forest is a metaphor for their identity and their sovereignty. Against the foil of the bloodshed in what the Indian government calls the ‘Red Corridor’, their philosophy gives a counterpoint to the dominant discourse.","popularity":0.0423,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2015-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Cannot Give You My Forest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3453073,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kavita Bahl","original_name":"Kavita Bahl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6271b12d89d97f0050846f7f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2837115,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nandan Saxena","original_name":"Nandan Saxena","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9c710d60975000384b845e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
