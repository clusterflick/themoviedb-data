It is an encounter with his alter-ego, a dialogue with his own conscience, a gradual dawning of the truth and an authentic glance at life... themes understandable by all. The film is an episode in the life of the director, a life full of surprises, and all the more so for being a cosmopolitan Armenian-American now standing on his native soil, his ultimate source of creative energy and ideas.","popularity":0.4874,"poster_path":"/1aHdcWVzTKPzKeoVijrnHr3gDUY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":142921,"logo_path":null,"name":"VS and Tigers Film
