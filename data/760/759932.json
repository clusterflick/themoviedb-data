They are professionally trained dancers that chose to break from the norm and explore the queerness of their bodies and their everyday self-expressions to turn their art form into a political tool, questioning the double standards of Colombian society. They create impromptu happenings, choreographed dances, kiki balls and have performed on stage with groups such as Pussy Riot, among others. Bogue stands for \"Bogota Voguing\" and seeks to capture the Tupamaras's attitude, athletic musculature, and spunky personalities.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/o5RUJ7C07nCK7AcgBcovXVrwnBZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bogue","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2483140,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Santiago Echeverry","original_name":"Santiago Echeverry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9fbaf41511aa0039ab9204","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14013184","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o5RUJ7C07nCK7AcgBcovXVrwnBZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
