In recent years, technical equipment has been developed which enables much more effective work. Included are seismometers and inclinometers, devices which can detect small changes in land elevation in volcanic areas. A network of such monitors and seismometers is now in use, monitoring for example, Mt. Hekla, Katla and the Krafla volcano as well the main earthquake zone in S-Iceland. There is a new inter-Nordic project which aims at developing forecasts for earthquakes.","popularity":0.0557,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":193093,"logo_path":null,"name":"Saga Film (ICE)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Watching the Volcanos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3940666,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ari Trausti Guðmundsson","original_name":"Ari Trausti Guðmundsson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fc0fd596e30b0087f8876f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3940666,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ari Trausti Guðmundsson","original_name":"Ari Trausti Guðmundsson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fc0fc67646fd0082232fd2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1945469,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sigmundur Arthúrsson","original_name":"Sigmundur Arthúrsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fc0fdee4b576009d1b5a6a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3940879,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Einar M.
