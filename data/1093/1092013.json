But after a deathly betrayal, he stumbles into Closure Cafe, an eerie watering-hole for misfits from across the ages. The bullet wounds don't hurt, but the memories do, and unless he finds answers soon, he will stay trapped there for all eternity, much like his mysterious bartender, Izumi. Can he ever learn to trust again, or can a lost soul never move on from a broken heart?","popularity":0.1099,"poster_path":"/sxbQh7ktf3n8YXUXtmVNLUDTYNP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":196222,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cerulean Sounds Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What's your poison?","title":"Closure Cafe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3972184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurence Warner","original_name":"Laurence Warner","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Aleksandr Mikhailovich Pastukhov","credit_id":"6419bc480d5d8500ba10db07","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3972185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shreya Jhalani","original_name":"Shreya Jhalani","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Tasneem Niazai","credit_id":"6419bc5a6a222700e976e192","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3768418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachanee Lumayno","original_name":"Rachanee Lumayno","popularity":0.1701,"profile_path":"/qZKGjQCKhZfGBa41OhkzAoeJPEo.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Haruki Izumi","credit_id":"63fad5e784f249008db06202","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1809216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ego Mikitas","original_name":"Ego Mikitas","popularity":0.1647,"profile_path":"/6bpMVYgZVbrpWiEFn2jNwaYQWv4.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Colonel (voice)","credit_id":"63fad52f6aa8e000968f634f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3972187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monique Gonsalves","original_name":"Monique Gonsalves","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Charon Styx","credit_id":"6419bc72e7414600f7efe649","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3972198,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Abhishek Pandit","original_name":"Abhishek Pandit","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6419bd29310325007c0b52b8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3034331,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tara Jenkins","original_name":"Tara Jenkins","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6419bd010d5d85007b69570b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3034331,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tara Jenkins","original_name":"Tara Jenkins","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6419bd1e6a22270085f163c6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3972184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurence Warner","original_name":"Laurence Warner","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6419bca00d5d8500f2d8366d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3972205,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Holland Maevers","original_name":"Holland Maevers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6419bd9d5690b5007a561145","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22180660","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q2q9wva6r05oZwbxjTpWW944TTD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sxbQh7ktf3n8YXUXtmVNLUDTYNP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xgYEIGo8U2CFFNV5odo3kX27pd5.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hEybSuylR2KYHVezGcqHS15YObv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"YouTube & Vimeo","release_date":"2023-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Closure Cafe trailer","key":"2CpEwVNSgHU","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-02-24T16:00:02.000Z","id":"63fad732344a8e00e6cdf023"}]}}}
