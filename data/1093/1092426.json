They don’t make cars here though, they make jet engines. Dennis, the manager of the department that assembles the engines, says that they breathe life into metal and make people’s dreams come true. He has been with the company since 1976 and is currently overseeing the assembly of the 1000th Trent XWB jet engine.  Things are looking good for the business at the moment, but after the pandemic brought the aviation industry to a standstill, no-one is taking anything for granted.
