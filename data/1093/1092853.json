After thirty years, the photos still elicit painful differences between a grieving mother and her stoic husband; Rúna a housewife living in the harsh and isolated west fjords keeps funeral photos of a terrible family tragedy. For Rúna, they mark a profound event which forever changed her and which belong side by side with photos of weddings, confirmations and baptisms; Erlendur and his stepdaughter Úlfhildur, after nursing his wife through a long battle with cancer, use photography to record her on her deathbed, in peace at last. And Sigrún, morbidly fascinated with funerals and wakes, compulsively videotapes acquaintances' family funerals as a bulwark against her own fear of death. When she experiences death first hand however, her attitudes change.","popularity":0.0567,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":193190,"logo_path":null,"name":"20 Geitur","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"1999-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Corpus Camera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1582586,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hrafnhildur Gunnarsdóttir","original_name":"Hrafnhildur Gunnarsdóttir","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fd08df84f24900ef624a31","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1582586,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hrafnhildur Gunnarsdóttir","original_name":"Hrafnhildur Gunnarsdóttir","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fd08c396e30b00dd71599c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117992,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jóhann Jóhannsson","original_name":"Jóhann Jóhannsson","popularity":0.2026,"profile_path":"/6TWdYn3opC6l5FBGACpTVbJn3yC.jpg","credit_id":"63fd08f672d85500bc84e468","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3941786,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sigurjón Baldur Hafsteinsson","original_name":"Sigurjón Baldur Hafsteinsson","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fd08d057176f009db47a72","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1582586,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hrafnhildur Gunnarsdóttir","original_name":"Hrafnhildur Gunnarsdóttir","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fd08e684f24900a9426f36","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3941786,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sigurjón Baldur Hafsteinsson","original_name":"Sigurjón Baldur Hafsteinsson","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fd08da84f249008db14d2d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3941786,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sigurjón Baldur Hafsteinsson","original_name":"Sigurjón Baldur Hafsteinsson","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fd09104772150086eebc14","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1582586,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hrafnhildur Gunnarsdóttir","original_name":"Hrafnhildur Gunnarsdóttir","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fd08eb47721500a2458bf9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1582586,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hrafnhildur Gunnarsdóttir","original_name":"Hrafnhildur Gunnarsdóttir","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fd09076aa8e000f0b79c6d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3050433,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Böðvar Bjarki Pétursson","original_name":"Böðvar Bjarki Pétursson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fd090072d85500bc84e46f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"is","note":"","release_date":"1999-04-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
