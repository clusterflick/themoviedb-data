When he flew his last flight in 1988, after 46 years in the air, he was the pilot with the highest amount of flight time in the world: most of it employed in adventurous and dangerous flights. This film follows Thorsteinn in his last flight, and walks down memory lane with him where his sparkling recital, and period footage, tells of his years as a pioneer aviator in Iceland, fighting pilot in the second world war, salvation flights into war-torn Biafra, and numerous other interesting and amusing tales.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":193093,"logo_path":null,"name":"Saga Film (ICE)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"1989-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tony Jónsson, Flight Certificate #13","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1945469,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sigmundur Arthúrsson","original_name":"Sigmundur Arthúrsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fbf5980c1255009c1037b5","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3053938,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jón Þór Hannesson","original_name":"Jón Þór Hannesson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fbf59196e30b009fca4b54","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":123958,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Skafti Guðmundsson","original_name":"Skafti Guðmundsson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fbf5b7344a8e007cba6267","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1945469,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sigmundur Arthúrsson","original_name":"Sigmundur Arthúrsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fbf5ac84f249007bf00e12","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3053938,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jón Þór Hannesson","original_name":"Jón Þór Hannesson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fbf59d96e30b0087f8740d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3918200,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jón Kjartansson","original_name":"Jón Kjartansson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fbf5c184f2490086155f35","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"is","note":"","release_date":"1989-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
