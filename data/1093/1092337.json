They have bought an old farm to pursue Susie’s dream of building her own business. She is a conservator and makes her living by stuffing animals, while he commutes for hours every day to do his job. She goes hunting, but he never really gets his hunting license. She wants a new hunting dog, he wants a new roof. ‘Revir’ is a sensitive tale of an unusual sibling bond against the dark backdrop of their shared upbringing, which the two adult siblings are forced to confront when their mother unexpectedly announces her arrival. Peter Hammer has a sure eye for all the little rifts and ingrained habits that shape any sibling relationship, as ‘Revir’ works its way towards a dramatic and existential turning point in Susie and Sune’s lives.","popularity":0.2386,"poster_path":"/lZ5NTEZZXgZed3oFvtD8kAx8saA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13209,"logo_path":"/oRnIhQrSz04N1TvffuiDZz3n4Rd.png","name":"Bullitt Film","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2023-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Revir - Everything You Hold Dear","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3940559,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Hammer","original_name":"Peter Hammer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fbc7ca84f249008615503c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":111140,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vibeke Vogel","original_name":"Vibeke Vogel","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643823991d538601135b88cb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15084,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anders Villadsen","original_name":"Anders Villadsen","popularity":0.0961,"profile_path":"/fVDHZcKCFHwF6PKAeiAOuwHu68y.jpg","credit_id":"64b530c437806200e2ac1b50","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3940559,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Hammer","original_name":"Peter Hammer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b530db0e4fc8519fec3e53","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2864425,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jacob Sofussen","original_name":"Jacob Sofussen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b530e90bb076014e4fbbae","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1784718,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rasmus Winther Jensen","original_name":"Rasmus Winther Jensen","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b530fb0e4fc8519ebaa256","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2528529,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lars Greve","original_name":"Lars Greve","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b531120e4fc8519b3eabea","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":234896,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clara Bruun","original_name":"Clara Bruun","popularity":0.1309,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b5313778570e00e33bfc6c","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310988,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Anders V.
