YouTube sensation and stand-up comedian Humza Arshad embarks on what is, at times, an uncomfortable journey to see if unsettled scores can be left behind.  As a teenager, Humza’s cousin suffered a brutal and unprovoked attack by a group of young men - an attack which left the family fragmented and scarred. Grappling with his inability to move on, Humza has an unexpected encounter with a killer and goes head-to-head with a ‘forgiveness academic'. With the help of his straight-talking mum and kept afloat by his faith and his unique sense of humour, he must confront the past and look for a way forward. Humza has clocked up more than 100 million views on YouTube, has won an MBE for his work in education and has over 240,000 followers on Instagram, but fame and notoriety has done little to prepare him for his current mission. This could be his toughest gig yet.","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":"/iQoJngbhk8nHUllOjbiIxKATufJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Humza: Forgiving the Unforgivable","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1625003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Humza Arshad","original_name":"Humza Arshad","popularity":0.0747,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63fd21c384f24900ef625100","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3941955,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Brendan Coles","original_name":"Brendan Coles","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fd2231344a8e00cdcd28ae","department":"Editing","job":"Online Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3941952,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rachel Drummond-Hay","original_name":"Rachel Drummond-Hay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fd220984f249007bf09aab","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3941949,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ahmed Peerbux","original_name":"Ahmed Peerbux","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fd21e284f24900a9427625","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3941953,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tamsin Summers","original_name":"Tamsin Summers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fd221596e30b00be5acca1","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2923503,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Colin Chipchase","original_name":"Colin Chipchase","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fd22236aa8e000c62d6f7a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3941956,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Arun Hall","original_name":"Arun Hall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fd223de4b5760081579f69","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26675900","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iQoJngbhk8nHUllOjbiIxKATufJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
