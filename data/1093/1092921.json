Following a wide-ranging exhibition at the Kjarvalsstaðir Art Gallery in 1989, he has become tired of the fantasy style which he had been developing for thirty years. What needed to happen in order for him to create something new? What sacrifices would it involve? This film is about that struggle experienced by creative artists. The film is not a biography, or a learned review of the painter's style, but it does show a side of the man which very few see. One evening, he feels he is not alone in his studio; it feels as if some being is there who wants to help him.","popularity":0.0817,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":194493,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kvikmyndaverstöðin ehf.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"2001-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Passio: A Painter's Psalm of Colours","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hjalti Rögnvaldsson","original_name":"Hjalti Rögnvaldsson","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"63fd393ecee2f600812613ad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3942062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sveinn Björnsson","original_name":"Sveinn Björnsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"63fd3989965220007cb9e518","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3942063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helga E.
