After overing the historical background of the bace, the film deals with the present situation from three different viewpoints: A) The role of the base in the context of international warfare in the North Atlantic and how Iceland would be defended in case of crises; B) The social impact that the presence of these forces has had on everyday life in Iceland, especially the surrounding communities; C) The economical importance of the base in Icelandic society. The film is an objective study of the situation and its author's purpose is to inform rather than influence the viewer.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":194437,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmusmiðjan hf.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"1987-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Land Without Arms","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3050042,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sigurður Snæberg Jónsson","original_name":"Sigurður Snæberg Jónsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fbf0ff0c125500a70b6068","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3050042,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sigurður Snæberg Jónsson","original_name":"Sigurður Snæberg Jónsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fbf1040c125500843ef437","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1945471,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Þorsteinn Úlfar Björnsson","original_name":"Þorsteinn Úlfar Björnsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fbf1306aa8e0008e841d2d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3050473,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Steingrímur Eyfjörð Guðmundsson","original_name":"Steingrímur Eyfjörð Guðmundsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fbf12884f24900a941f293","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1876618,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Karl Oskarsson","original_name":"Karl Oskarsson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/d9SGvzK5DsaNp33EK5qcNYoqo0z.jpg","credit_id":"63fbf11584f249008db0c96d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3050042,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sigurður Snæberg Jónsson","original_name":"Sigurður Snæberg Jónsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fbf11e344a8e00e6ce5b00","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0491058","wikidata_id":"Q16422512","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"is","note":"","release_date":"1987-06-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
