But extensive scientific research has shown that the Thingvellir area is one of the wonders of the world and is indeed unique. The American plate and the European plate separate exactly at Thingvellir so the area and Lake Thingvallavatn are positioned between two continents. This is shown in detailed video graphic as well as in extensive aerial and close-up shots of the area. At Thingvellir we are standing on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge – we can see the ground split, Thingvellir sink and Lake Thingvallavatn grow. In flora and fauna – here is the meeting place of the East and the West. Lake Thingvallavatn is a very young – no more than 10,000 years old. However, four varieties af Arctic Char have evolved in it, and that is a world wonder. The lake is extremely clear which makes the underwater pictures of the Arctic char in their natural habitat very real.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/gHGKcFhOl6WjvTUdYxOhpschQrU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":193782,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lífsmynd Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lake Between the Continents","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1277217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valdimar Leifsson","original_name":"Valdimar Leifsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fd09bae4b57600bd3984e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1277217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valdimar Leifsson","original_name":"Valdimar Leifsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fd09bf477215008295b82a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gHGKcFhOl6WjvTUdYxOhpschQrU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"is","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
