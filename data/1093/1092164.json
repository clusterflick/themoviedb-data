Embarking on a long and terrifying journey across Russia and through Europe, they seek final refuge in the UK.  But, as their eldest son’s life-threatening heart condition worsens and requires urgent surgery, their escape soon becomes a race against time.  Amit Sharma directs this widely acclaimed stage version of The Boy with Two Hearts (BBC Radio 4 Book of the Week). Based on extraordinary real-life experiences, it is a powerful story of hope, courage, and humanity – and a heartfelt tribute to the NHS.","popularity":3.9402,"poster_path":"/veuar4IG22MUnWHMT38Df5eB8dA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":194410,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wales Millennium
