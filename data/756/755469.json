It documents and extracts evidence of the wall’s existence—there are three consecutive walls in the part of Mexico where grew up—in front of Trump’s proposed wall prototypes. This section of border fence, at Shroud of Turin, is made up of corrugated jet landing mats that were recycled from the Gulf War/Desert Storm. It was erected during Operation Gatekeeper, a strategic reinforcement of the U.S./Mexico Border, which was responsible for more migrant deaths in its first year than in the entirety of the previous seventy five years of Border Patrol History. She and her team took rust impressions from these walls on cotton as evidence of their existence.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"America’s Wall","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2822716,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tanya Aguiñiga","original_name":"Tanya Aguiñiga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f8ec3dc89f7490039050659","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2822718,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackie Amézquita","original_name":"Jackie Amézquita","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f8ec3e817c4430038ddfdf7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2822720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cecilia Brawley","original_name":"Cecilia Brawley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f8ec3f1d9f4a60036d4bc5a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2822721,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalie Godinez","original_name":"Natalie Godinez","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f8ec3f9d9f4a60036d4bc63","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2822722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Izabella Sanchez","original_name":"Izabella Sanchez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5f8ec401ac617c003781b574","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2822723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shannen Wallace","original_name":"Shannen Wallace","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5f8ec40917c4430039dfa0ab","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2822716,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tanya Aguiñiga","original_name":"Tanya Aguiñiga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8ec3d6fed597003847e57f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Armory Center for the Arts","release_date":"2020-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
