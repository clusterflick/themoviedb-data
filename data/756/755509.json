Gathered from the internet, most of the images that compose the film are fragile, amateur-shot traces from within nature and its tremors that regularly rock these communities. Volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and tsunamis form the film’s visual fabric, and are set against images of grandiose natural landscapes. A visual elegy, the film resolutely acknowledges the superiority of nature, with its unrelenting force, capable of transcending all human ambition. With this, the filmmaker seems to remind us that humankind will not emerge victorious from the ecological havoc that it has created.","popularity":0.1323,"poster_path":"/vcMOnIcxVSkvpMKOWBNPUhM54uK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108683,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fondation Cartier pour l’art contemporain","origin_country":""},{"id":114055,"logo_path":null,"name":"ZKM Karlsruhe","origin_country":""},{"id":175818,"logo_path":null,"name":"Folk Arts Hub Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","name":"Armenia"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nature","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","title":"Բնություն","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Природа","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","title":"Daba","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1166966,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Artavazd Peleshian","original_name":"Artavazd Peleshian","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":"/w7fcAywIWYrPwAupDmV28b4TSes.jpg","credit_id":"631e7c461ac29200820062c3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1166966,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Artavazd Peleshian","original_name":"Artavazd Peleshian","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":"/w7fcAywIWYrPwAupDmV28b4TSes.jpg","credit_id":"5f8eeeb6f8aee80033c3d3db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11302200","wikidata_id":"Q110801574","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1068,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/icFvHZ9zBAOR1iJQf27v7sGbBBg.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1899},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/544oLFCDXFrlL0GFbx7OoRbNxD1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/nc3KS8hQxvmdTqoLIzU59ew0FrT.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vcMOnIcxVSkvpMKOWBNPUhM54uK.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1621,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wxSaiyGj6zORUIRLSTGiiWzdfxV.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/hAe0dIJvGZWbs2udO9KcfdV1q0L.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/j4OKcjqpSemttdPV5OlTqyovJsN.jpg","vote_average":1.222,"vote_count":3,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yEi2wCKMOjuE4JmVxrMGufs8mJ2.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":2120,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/s9xGZDHciKNyQd6Bjh2O5oAV5c4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jeonju International Film Festival","release_date":"2022-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"« La Nature » de Artavazd Pelechian au cinéma le 23 février 2022","key":"hocnmNotZtc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-02-16T13:45:09.000Z","id":"62fac4dce267de00928b8b23"}]}}}
