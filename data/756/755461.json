Few others try to look for the traces of the past there, some come just for a walk and yet another group engages into family feasting. Next to strollers and contemplators, there sometimes come cats creeping among the tombs and squirrels looking out from trees. Immersed in deadly silence, the cemetery comes to life from time to time, while the faces from tomb photographs, frozen in time, look at all this in silence.","popularity":0.1651,"poster_path":"/17hNIZdhVWUd2aCi4kWyB7ecBsX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BY","name":"Belarus"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2020-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Epitaph","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2032309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victor Asliuk","original_name":"Victor Asliuk","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8ebf3bce9e91003449044f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13432180","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/17hNIZdhVWUd2aCi4kWyB7ecBsX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Russian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Russian\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"ru\", \"native_name\"=>\"Russian\"}","note":"Northern Lights Nordic-Baltic Film Festival in Belarus","release_date":"2020-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
