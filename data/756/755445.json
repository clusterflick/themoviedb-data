The film is made in the technique of applying an image on a 35mm film. As a source material used some footage from the film by Evgeny Yufit \"Silver Heads\". In 1999, the film \"Cola\" took part in the Berlinale. Plot: nature cannot stop science, which creates a hybrid of man and tree.","popularity":0.077,"poster_path":"/uE8DFGhvWj9p048yr5oSoMvblbg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"1999-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stakes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Koly","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1104756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikolay Marton","original_name":"Nikolay Marton","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/bIZ1wjITG43AWHziZdamyvqfdGv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"623cd82f6f43ec0047808008","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2287629,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boris Kazakov","original_name":"Boris Kazakov","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/iowhfhOfdhVvan4gYO9BGqawnlL.jpg","credit_id":"5f8ea68211386c484ffdfdb8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0192211","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/etnq2H4OXT2CqSkYToObXwIolnw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uE8DFGhvWj9p048yr5oSoMvblbg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlin International Film Festival","release_date":"1999-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
