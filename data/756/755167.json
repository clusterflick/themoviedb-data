Nancy Chan plays a naïve young woman who can sing and dance. Under the arrangement of her stepfather, she becomes a star and indulges in the glitz and glamour of the entertainment world before getting married to a wealthy heir in Nanyang. Yet her husband is cruel and unfaithful, leading her to divorce and return to her parents in Shanghai. She is set for a comeback to the stage. Her young daughter suffers from a serious illness. A remake of the Bu Wanchang’s silent film The Light of Maternal Instinct (1933), this film takes cues from Hollywood musicals, resulting in an elegant and lively fusion of camera movement and musical numbers. The film also reflects the harsh reality of China in the 1930s and the pathos of popular literature by combining morals, entertainment and social commentary to show that changes in the idea of femininity is a symbol of progress.","popularity":0.591,"poster_path":"/hZaSYLsfkI67oKAo9gavFoBpVcO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":184567,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hua Cheng Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"1939-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Angel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"Mother and Daughter","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1692615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nancy Wan-Seung Chan","original_name":"Nancy Wan-Seung Chan","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":"/5hrLDEatLQS4PEfICVJqYreWyHL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f8dbd99f8aee80035bd7e5b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1366183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hong Bai","original_name":"Hong Bai","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/1bAMFFqw4rdw6fyQGzec6lcjEw3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f8dbe15f8aee80034bcc3da","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2095777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lu Luming","original_name":"Lu Luming","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/m5hekuMfxuwmumErbPiqjlFBsj2.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f8dbe1d11386c0037fee989","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1421649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yin Wang","original_name":"Yin Wang","popularity":0.1464,"profile_path":"/fKluyhPUcTBKV0qLNGDnmDdqDNY.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f8dbe27cb802800390b536e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2606145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xinyuan Xu","original_name":"Xinyuan Xu","popularity":0.0594,"profile_path":"/5nPjHF8typy3zLvcnpmdOtUHOwU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f8dbe4ece9e910035481746","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2901697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Min Sun","original_name":"Min Sun","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/unonOD1NfyIotMbrDdaDHQggEdV.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"66fc1fb0411656c0e4f18d7a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4974371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"傅威廉","original_name":"傅威廉","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"66fc2093f17b887599d6474b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1587075,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yiu Kwang-Chao","original_name":"Yiu Kwang-Chao","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/p7FUo6KCyxMjjQc53na4DU2qN8k.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"66fc20cbd8064165bdf1a08c","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2561506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xiucen Yin","original_name":"Xiucen Yin","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":"/ADkAWTwk9UNrAjL1MLilYGOAFK.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"66fc20f86ec7804796d65317","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1279061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jiqun Liu","original_name":"Jiqun Liu","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"66fc211a6ec7804796d6532d","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240182,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Griffin Yueh Feng","original_name":"Griffin Yueh Feng","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":"/nixVWUnhIoW7OcZ3ZPlpgoM68eh.jpg","credit_id":"5f8dbe5bac617c00377d8a02","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240182,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Griffin Yueh Feng","original_name":"Griffin Yueh Feng","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":"/nixVWUnhIoW7OcZ3ZPlpgoM68eh.jpg","credit_id":"5f8dbea47646fd003a912f24","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0194576","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hZaSYLsfkI67oKAo9gavFoBpVcO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9714,"name":"remake"},{"id":165643,"name":"song and dance"},{"id":206191,"name":"stardom"},{"id":292479,"name":"wenyi (melodrama)"},{"id":305385,"name":"nanyang"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1939-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
