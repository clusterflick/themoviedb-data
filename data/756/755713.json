But how can one put a price tag on something so personal as another’s music? Owner and Vinyl Buyer Rick Wojcik walks us into the homes – and stories – of strangers, digging their jazz, soul and hip hop records, buying their once-prized possessions. Each seller shares a common reason: they face a major life transition. The documentary is a collection of intimate narratives, akin to a record album of songs. About love, loss, and our deep connection to music.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/aP8MU5vpxk4TasFDHyGufDsbOa9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dusty Groove: The Sound of Transition (with Baba Sura)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1454574,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danielle Beverly","original_name":"Danielle Beverly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8f8cc117c4430039e216ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aP8MU5vpxk4TasFDHyGufDsbOa9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
