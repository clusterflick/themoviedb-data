The present film offers the opportunity to see screenwriter Galeen in front of the camera as the super-rich American Francis. The journeyman carpenter Harry is bewitched by Francis’s daughter Dorothy, whom he has to rescue from the clutches of dangerous hoodlums. The gang is also trying to steal the crown of a prince. Thus Harry finds himself in a sophisticated adventure that features spectacular nature shots (filmed in the Alps).","popularity":0.1671,"poster_path":"/efuVl4Ak3oBIFZrVafUfmkG216u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1924-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dangerous Paths","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1134642,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Piel","original_name":"Harry Piel","popularity":0.0946,"profile_path":"/7psHmYx8Qx1Ac84wjJmbXqtARaj.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f8f82c243cd540039fe84bd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1340386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dary Holm","original_name":"Dary Holm","popularity":0.0895,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f8f82c9ac617c0037843ec3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1374889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gustav Oberg","original_name":"Gustav Oberg","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f8f82cff90b190036038aef","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1719257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jenny Marba","original_name":"Jenny Marba","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f8f82d6383df20036ab2fd9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9833,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Henrik Galeen","original_name":"Henrik Galeen","popularity":0.3349,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f8f82dc17c4430036e45fa2","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29173,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Kurt Richter","original_name":"Kurt Richter","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606a9196a14bef00792a3639","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9833,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Henrik Galeen","original_name":"Henrik Galeen","popularity":0.3349,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8f837117c4430039e1c1b3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188612,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adolf Lantz","original_name":"Adolf Lantz","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8f836afed5970038496f32","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1134642,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Piel","original_name":"Harry Piel","popularity":0.0946,"profile_path":"/7psHmYx8Qx1Ac84wjJmbXqtARaj.jpg","credit_id":"5f8f837af90b190036038db1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0014686","wikidata_id":"Q16954094","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":837,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/efuVl4Ak3oBIFZrVafUfmkG216u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":559}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1924-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
