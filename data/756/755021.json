F.A.T.E were once a growing religion but, after a miscalculated doomsday prediction in the 1950s, membership has dwindled. In recent years F.A.T.E have been linked to disappearances of former members, the leader Daniel Love has gone into self-imposed exile, and this year their crops are failing. Except the potatoes. In need of money, the gang recruit new member Rachel, at a local rehab facility. Rachel breathes new life into the group and, when she turns the head of lifelong member Comet, old relationships begin to fracture. As the comet that F.A.T.E believe will bring with it the end of the world approaches, the group's beliefs are tested. New secrets emerge which threaten everything the cult has been working towards.","popularity":0.1174,"poster_path":"/yO0G40TP2nuwZh0D1saC7XlsOaM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Join us.","title":"Cult","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1748906,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elizabeth Sankey","original_name":"Elizabeth Sankey","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":"/3KL3VfVUyB49WOm8Y2LGRkTK0HD.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Rachel","credit_id":"5f8d627917c4430039dbd715","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2821290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Calvin Crawley","original_name":"Calvin Crawley","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Comet","credit_id":"5f8d6285397df0003a59c141","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2821292,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marianne Chase","original_name":"Marianne Chase","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/cfYaS0wdSujMZ5K3bQwoN52XV5z.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Beck","credit_id":"5f8d629989f7490038025871","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2021396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Pointing","original_name":"Jon Pointing","popularity":0.4345,"profile_path":"/44uiVF37L3jsIq90bBWVFUh8XAB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Voice Over","credit_id":"5f8d62a589f749003802588b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2821293,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luke Ibbetson","original_name":"Luke Ibbetson","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Filmmaker","credit_id":"5f8d62aeefd3c200383ad8ce","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2821294,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Luke Ibbetson","original_name":"Luke Ibbetson","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8d62c489f7490037009613","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2821295,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luke Ibbetson","original_name":"Luke Ibbetson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8d62d1cb802800380702a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2821297,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lauren India Stewardson","original_name":"Lauren India Stewardson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8d62e0397df0003b58adab","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2821298,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Josh Wardle","original_name":"Josh Wardle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8d62ee11386c0036ff7e6d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2821299,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Emily Taylor","original_name":"Emily Taylor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8d62fbcb8028003708684c","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2821302,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kyle Chase","original_name":"Kyle Chase","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8d6314f8aee80033be622f","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2821303,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Connolly","original_name":"David Connolly","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8d632ff8aee80034bc518a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10122846","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":859,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3wFme1etwXRvgoAsHfO0Hh1uh43.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1529}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":2807,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kp89KlBQzHXUI80SRgcbksqx0Os.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1997},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yO0G40TP2nuwZh0D1saC7XlsOaM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10123,"name":"dark comedy"},{"id":6158,"name":"cult"},{"id":11800,"name":"mockumentary"},{"id":163053,"name":"found footage"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
