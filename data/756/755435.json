Glorified vice. Crime that pays. You can’t do that said the film industry’s Production Code. But in the pre-Code era, Hollywood could – and did – with lots of classic style. On Disc 1 of this set of five pre-Code sizzlers, Norma Shearer is The Divorcée – her Best Actress Oscar®-winning* role – who believes sexual freedom is for women too. And she’s also A Free Soul who falls for gangster Clark Gable (and is defended in a murder trial by Best Actor Academy Award® winner* Lionel Barrymore). Disc 2 delivers platinum-haired Bette Davis in Three on a Match’s searing tale of adultery and Ruth Chatterton as a tycoon who buys herself boy toys in Female. And on Disc 3, Barbara Stanwyck defies sinister Clark Gable to protect an endangered child in Night Nurse.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forbidden Hollywood Collection Volume 2","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
