The horizon was limited to the view from the window, boredom permeated the days, and an endless stream of catastrophic rumors emanated from the radio and television. Against the backdrop of his own mental and physical discomfort, the director begins to shoot a video diary. The similarly non-existent static camera records existential monologues as well as activities serving basic bodily needs. This philosophical essay is woven from reflections on the coming transformation of the world and the images that try to capture it.","popularity":0.1342,"poster_path":"/6Ak0AkHruzPFp1rLLSpW78mlK8e.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dissipatio","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2823928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Federica Villa","original_name":"Federica Villa","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5f901524f8aee80034c01406","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1336330,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carlo Michele Schirinzi","original_name":"Carlo Michele Schirinzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5f90153355c1f40039223ffa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2655625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filippo Ticozzi","original_name":"Filippo Ticozzi","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5f90153f43cd540037fff2e4","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2655625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filippo Ticozzi","original_name":"Filippo Ticozzi","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9014ab7614210039867f01","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2655625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filippo Ticozzi","original_name":"Filippo Ticozzi","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9014c955c1f40037212c10","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2655625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filippo Ticozzi","original_name":"Filippo Ticozzi","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9014d0d9f4a60036d96be6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2655625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filippo Ticozzi","original_name":"Filippo Ticozzi","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9014d743cd540039008c3d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2655625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filippo Ticozzi","original_name":"Filippo Ticozzi","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9014f7c048a90039436f61","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2655625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filippo Ticozzi","original_name":"Filippo Ticozzi","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f901506fed59700394e6fee","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2655631,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Federico Minetti","original_name":"Federico Minetti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f901514f8aee80035c25e02","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14068342","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":850,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6Ak0AkHruzPFp1rLLSpW78mlK8e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jihlava International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2020-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"trailer Dissipatio","key":"461385559","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2020-09-24T12:54:56.000Z","id":"5f970a3f1cc4ff003444f9f2"}]}}}
