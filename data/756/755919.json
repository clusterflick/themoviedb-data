The major players talk freely about good times and bad — art rock, the wayward genius of Judd (including a rare interview), Noel Crombie’s spoon playing and costume design, hard times in England and the punk backlash, the big pop hits after Neil joined, Tim’s solo album, an obsession with paper darts, and the pre-gig ritual of One For One.","popularity":0.1634,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Split Enz: Spellbound","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2056667,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tim Finn","original_name":"Tim Finn","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f906178ac617c0037873a63","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Neill","original_name":"Sam Neill","popularity":2.486,"profile_path":"/iIfuxalf37xUayuGyK0zG7z6WEZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5f906199d9f4a60036da53f0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":781764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Finn","original_name":"Neil Finn","popularity":0.195,"profile_path":"/v6Ze04cxN5Tie16gmaQX4jFQdSY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f9061e7f8aee80033c8d974","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1151774,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bruce Sheridan","original_name":"Bruce Sheridan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself - Interviewer","credit_id":"5f906237fed597003749bb9a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2824249,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kerry Brown","original_name":"Kerry Brown","popularity":0.0678,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f906277383df20034af2c72","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2824250,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Sheridan","original_name":"Bruce Sheridan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f906291fed59700364cb0aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2824250,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Sheridan","original_name":"Bruce Sheridan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f90629d383df20034af2cdc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
