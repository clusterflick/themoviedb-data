Besides their behavior as children, they seem to act as tramps. For example they attempt to make a bed out of cardboard boxes, but also pelt each other with them. Franzson's sombre, repetitive music enhances the sinister atmosphere of Mik's film, while the images give an extra charge to the music, which consists of improvisation on ceramic windpipes and double bass. The low, constant tone of the windpipe, played by the composer himself, has its equivalent in the highly repetitive nature of Mik's work. Franzson wanted to imitate the sound of the wind till the point were nature meets culture.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/nZB05Cntxhq2s0WNOiVIQArYtlf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2820519,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aernout Mik","original_name":"Aernout Mik","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/k2eyhngkVEiTcV7M1d9oUOWQL2V.jpg","credit_id":"5f8ec38489f7490038075c7e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nZB05Cntxhq2s0WNOiVIQArYtlf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
