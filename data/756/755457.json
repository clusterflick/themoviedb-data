Commonplace but incredible at the same time, the scenes bear witness to the war in all its “rawness” with non-manipulated images, as the title of the work suggests. Soldiers and civilians intermingle. Shooting and fires form a background to the actions of ordinary people doing their jobs or walking through the streets.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/gqdkXNxwGYHx24wYR1zKAGQXM0i.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raw Footage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2820519,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aernout Mik","original_name":"Aernout Mik","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/k2eyhngkVEiTcV7M1d9oUOWQL2V.jpg","credit_id":"5f8eb8a7ac617c0036806158","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":948,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gqdkXNxwGYHx24wYR1zKAGQXM0i.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":632}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
