Thompson went to the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago as a journalist and returned home disgusted, yet motivated by what he’d just seen: violently suppressed protests, riots, corrupt politicians, and abusive cops. Back in Aspen, he finds more of the same. The local police and sheriff’s departments are targeting young people, harassing and charging them with absurd crimes and trying to push them out of town. Hunter decides he has to do something to change the police brutality that has become the norm.","popularity":0.19,"poster_path":"/wGPVka6V9WK2FCSlZICRomX3ZEe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro.","title":"Freak Power: The Ballot or the Bomb","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hunter S.
