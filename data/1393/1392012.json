Two particles? Perhaps they are also two musicians: the first and second violins. An absurd scenario. Voices A and B speak to each other, but they can't hear each other ... Without the words Fukushima or nuclear power being mentioned even once, “Kein Licht. (2011/2012/2017)” depicts a ghostly world after the nuclear disaster. The text by Elfriede Jelinek becomes the libretto of a world premiere musical performance at the Ruhrtriennale. Frenchman Philippe Manoury is composing a new musical theater work for actors, singers and a musical ensemble. The special feature: The music itself also becomes an uncontrollable element. Together with director Nicolas Stemann, Manoury is developing a new form in which pre-composed orchestral and electronic score modules are combined with live electronics that intervene in the modulation of the singers and actors - in real time. Music is verbalized and language is musicalized.","popularity":0.1628,"poster_path":"/kwlcptzAC2ji5ukHcmfTxmIlWas.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":245474,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ruhrtriennale","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":133,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ruhrtriennale","title":"Kein Licht","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2454614,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christina Daletska","original_name":"Christina Daletska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Alt","credit_id":"6741846fdae2e6a938257fc6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5076497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lionel Peintre","original_name":"Lionel Peintre","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Bariton","credit_id":"67418485d7bee5585c55c42b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5076499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Sun","original_name":"Sarah Sun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Soprano","credit_id":"6741849cdd53fa0060335013","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3025771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olivia Vermeulen","original_name":"Olivia Vermeulen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mezzosoprano","credit_id":"674184bad7bee5585c55c43d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niels Bormann","original_name":"Niels Bormann","popularity":0.1084,"profile_path":"/jJGfDbDBBsTjQsW62ZyIoBdjgXn.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Actor","credit_id":"674184d69f40a7aaf6ea0a0a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline Peters","original_name":"Caroline Peters","popularity":0.313,"profile_path":"/AeBxK1HDfrBaLpuexORgNZLwRck.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Actress","credit_id":"674184e47b825e685b4e47b0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5076508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"United Instruments of Lucilin","original_name":"United Instruments of Lucilin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Orchestra","credit_id":"6741850adae2e6a93825801d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5076509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julien Leroy","original_name":"Julien Leroy","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"6741851adae2e6a93825802e","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5076512,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Philippe Manoury","original_name":"Philippe Manoury","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6741852e9f40a7aaf6ea0a41","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1074827,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elfriede Jelinek","original_name":"Elfriede Jelinek","popularity":0.0754,"profile_path":"/GB1KJDPzA5QLAjJfrjxgdIArRx.jpg","credit_id":"6741853b7b825e685b4e47f4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3184853,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Stemann","original_name":"Nicolas Stemann","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6741854f7b825e685b4e4806","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":2346,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kwlcptzAC2ji5ukHcmfTxmIlWas.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1567}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2017-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
