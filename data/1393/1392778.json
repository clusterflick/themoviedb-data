The written text is from the example sentences in English dictionaries. I always find those examples fascinating as they display random, surprising and poetic qualities. Their fragmentary aspects also refer to the possibilities of varied narrative context. Subtitles typically function as a translation of the spoken (original) text in films. However, the English text in this piece is the original and the spoken text (voice-over) is a translation. There are two kinds of translations: from one language to another and from written text to spoken text. The B&W images were created as responses to either the English text or Korean text. The three elements had equal weights in terms of creating rhythms in editing process.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This is a story for small children. a true-life love story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2691728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sujin Lee","original_name":"Sujin Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6743719cdae2e6a93825bdd7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
