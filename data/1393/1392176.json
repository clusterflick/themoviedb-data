The plot of Carl Maria von Weber's romantic fairy opera, which premiered at London's Covent Garden in 1826, is quite astonishing: after the fairy king Oberon has fallen out with his wife Titania, it is humans of all people who are supposed to make things right. Titania will only be reconciled if a human couple proves the truthfulness of their love to the death. Oberon's servant Puck already has someone in mind: the crusader Hüon of Bordeaux, who loves the caliph's daughter Rezia.","popularity":0.1323,"poster_path":"/o6n77iaSFUx9PNX0yatRVkDT7E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37841,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bayerische Staatsoper","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":178,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Munich Opera Festival","title":"Oberon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2228928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julian Prégardien","original_name":"Julian Prégardien","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Oberon","credit_id":"674200b84b15b8ae31b02259","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5077212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alyona Abramowa","original_name":"Alyona Abramowa","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Titania","credit_id":"674200cbd8db7dd1ba4532c1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1154136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annette Dasch","original_name":"Annette Dasch","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Rezia","credit_id":"674200e17b825e685b4e5d86","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brenden Gunnell","original_name":"Brenden Gunnell","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Hüon von Bordeaux","credit_id":"674200f61bcb2c093805ab56","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2168815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachael Wilson","original_name":"Rachael Wilson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Fatime","credit_id":"67420110f0f2ed8f985211ef","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3455494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johannes Kammler","original_name":"Johannes Kammler","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/mvDYFg4Su2JZ56ObGAQBH2rZqEC.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Scherasmin","credit_id":"674201236370ecad3fffdcde","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3855296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna El-Khashem","original_name":"Anna El-Khashem","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Meermädchen","credit_id":"67420134f0f2ed8f985211f8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5077219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuela Linshalm","original_name":"Manuela Linshalm","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Puck","credit_id":"67420141f0f2ed8f98521206","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1727943,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel-Frantisek Kamen","original_name":"Daniel-Frantisek Kamen","popularity":0.0927,"profile_path":"/pP6jejcnqrfun25rZrnAd20kANf.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Puck","credit_id":"6742014e4b15b8ae31b0227e","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5077221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sebastian Mock","original_name":"Sebastian Mock","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Puck","credit_id":"6742015cd8db7dd1ba453321","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569419,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ivor Bolton","original_name":"Ivor Bolton","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":"/bdkL76voeiJzIMky1cEQWs8Klwp.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"6742016df0f2ed8f9852122b","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1103839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikolaus Habjan","original_name":"Nikolaus Habjan","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67420182f0f2ed8f98521231","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1376641,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carl Maria von Weber","original_name":"Carl Maria von Weber","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/bGp1h4AJGDAzLnSZb8IYMaHdRac.jpg","credit_id":"6742018ff0f2ed8f9852123f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.662,"height":2360,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o6n77iaSFUx9PNX0yatRVkDT7E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1562}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2017-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
