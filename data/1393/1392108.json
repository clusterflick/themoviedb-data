Sex Pistols Secret History","overview":"The '70s work of the late Dave Goodman leads US directly into the shocking true story of the birth - and initial success - of the Sex Pistols, the most explosive Rock 'N' Roll band ever (and the group for whom Dave G was the first serious producer). a band that still shock and thrill, in equal measure, some 30 years later. The filmmakers were lucky enough to know Dave back then and luckier still in getting other key figures to talk about him and the Pistols for this film - including manager Malcolm McLaren, Pistol Glen Matlock, photographer Ray Stevenson, film-maker Don Letts, broadcaster/label bigwig Tony Wilson and many others. Their words make up not just the bizarre tale of Dave and the Pistols but also the full flavor of what Punk, and Britain in the '70s, was really like.
