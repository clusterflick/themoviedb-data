This year, he is staging the love drama Alessandro nell'Indie by Leonardo Vinci based on a libretto by Pietro Metastasio. Alessandro nell'Indie was published in Rome in 1730, where women were barred from performing for religious reasons. The Bayreuth production takes up this fact with an all-male cast featuring the Brazilian soprano Bruno de Sá and the countertenors Franco Fagioli and Jake Arditti in the leading roles. The orchestra is the Polish {OH!} Orkiestra Historyczna under the direction of Martyna Pastuszka. The Bayreuth Baroque Opera Festival stages music theater in the authentic ambience of the Margravial Opera House in Bayreuth.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":"/zN5aBNyAXiJ3JWcinVsxmUTLvsK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":245472,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bayreuth Baroque Opera Festival","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2022-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":233,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bayreuth Baroque Opera Festival","title":"Alessandro nell'Indie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2148052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franco Fagioli","original_name":"Franco Fagioli","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/YBuTjY4XN87AIaaabVfk76NBqs.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Poro","credit_id":"67417920015d2e0f702e1aba","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5076438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruno de Sá","original_name":"Bruno de Sá","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Cleofide","credit_id":"6741794bdae2e6a938257ce4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2133010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jake Arditti","original_name":"Jake Arditti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Erissena","credit_id":"67417956015d2e0f702e1adc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5076440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maayan Licht","original_name":"Maayan Licht","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Alessandro","credit_id":"67417969015d2e0f702e1aed","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5076442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefan Sbonnik","original_name":"Stefan Sbonnik","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Gandarte","credit_id":"67417977dae2e6a938257d2b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2566090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicholas Tamagna","original_name":"Nicholas Tamagna","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/xQ1MngOTORhYSiQkU27Y4ekbLJs.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Timagene","credit_id":"67417988aab722bfa7c8dc4c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5076444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Orkiestra Historyczna","original_name":"Orkiestra Historyczna","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Orchestra","credit_id":"6741799a32a9aaf43d96a49f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5076446,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martyna Pastuszka","original_name":"Martyna Pastuszka","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"674179c7dae2e6a938257d5e","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2235200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Emanuel Cenčić","original_name":"Max Emanuel Cenčić","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/10ylP5jdFqf0XYovIWBdEvJgdZB.jpg","credit_id":"674179ff32a9aaf43d96a4be","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2369930,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leonardo Vinci","original_name":"Leonardo Vinci","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67417a157b825e685b4e45c4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1655135,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pietro Metastasio","original_name":"Pietro Metastasio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67417a2fdd53fa0060334db2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":2341,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zN5aBNyAXiJ3JWcinVsxmUTLvsK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1555}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
