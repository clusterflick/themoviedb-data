It was inspired by Alma Thomas’ Starry Night and the Astronauts, which depicts an expansive watery surface that captures the streaks of light from the Sun. Thomas’ painting not only immerses one within this blue space but allows one to reflect on her painting process, as it’s visibly constructed stroke by stroke. Like this extensive process, Streaks of Color intended to capture the smaller, transient moments in a relationship. Although we may often forget to appreciate these fleeting moments, Streaks of Color encourages its viewers to take a step back and reflect on and appreciate them.","popularity":0.093,"poster_path":"/5SGVT0v8RWvIJ903bF1UuqIUNis.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Streaks of Color","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5079615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriela Norwood","original_name":"Gabriela Norwood","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"674366cfd8db7dd1ba4570eb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5079616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cydney Brown","original_name":"Cydney Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"674366d67b825e685b4e96bb","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4735790,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"MJ Gudiño","original_name":"MJ Gudiño","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6743669f7b825e685b4e9696","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4752894,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mary Belay","original_name":"Mary Belay","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674366b080b44a8937b783fe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3812218,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Satarie Bennett","original_name":"Satarie Bennett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674366bed8db7dd1ba4570dd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5SGVT0v8RWvIJ903bF1UuqIUNis.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
