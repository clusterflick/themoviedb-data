But mother was busy. “You’re always busy when I need you!” Didi was angry, “I need you now!”  Didi, an impatient boy, embarks on a fascinating journey to the land of magic. On his way, he meets colorful characters who block his path and pile up difficulties. From his friends, the jackal and the giraffe, Didi learns the language of the heart, a language of non-violent communication that opens every door.  The giraffe has “magic keys” with which Didi solves his problems creatively and in pleasant ways.  Wait patiently, take a deep breath, use the magic keys:  “explain..observe…express feelings…”","popularity":0.2522,"poster_path":"/gdh3cN9tzjXerrYSxUkO3nYx87S.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":245503,"logo_path":null,"name":"NMC
