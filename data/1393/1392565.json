One night I was walking around the area with my little camera and decided to record the Maria's work and the space around it. The photographs in the window showed disjointed figures and faces that seemed to come out of a nightmare. Every one of them gave me a feeling of terrible anxiety. They were faces, hands and metaphorical cries that denounced a problem that affects a large part of the young population: the problem of housing. With these recordings as a starting point, I began to make this audiovisual piece.","popularity":0.0398,"poster_path":"/h4OFfJnXb5mIhtdrN95zuHFPfa1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The windows","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4604097,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guillermo Amengual","original_name":"Guillermo Amengual","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/3URzUyZd74LfmzCgZetfNTv6WQC.jpg","credit_id":"67431ddf1bcb2c093805c47c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4604097,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guillermo Amengual","original_name":"Guillermo Amengual","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/3URzUyZd74LfmzCgZetfNTv6WQC.jpg","credit_id":"67431de91bcb2c093805c487","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xwk2OkHgRnRw69LYSO4bQvIsrJC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5oVNA1qBD6a8FeMIwal79FGImss.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ncOI98Dq5m4pNWXW9zu2AqEeid1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/siSEKp2MppczC4NDPvgXFB8WQ6T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kvX9itnOTsYWiPPM8wIpGjgDuS3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e2KkyIvlREcj3UXhysuIFChgfBs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h4OFfJnXb5mIhtdrN95zuHFPfa1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ca","note":"YouTube","release_date":"2024-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Les finestres | Guillermo Amengual, 2024","key":"f9iChwsaNXM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-09-26T17:41:02.000Z","id":"67431da4ac27f516d9f374fe"}]}}}
