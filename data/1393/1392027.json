How it stirs the soul and quickens the heart. Like a flame, it flickers and dances, illuminating the darkness, warming the cold. It is a love that knows no bounds, that lives and dies in the same breath. Without games or pretense you lay yourself bare in hope of acceptance. A journey of exploration and discovery. And yet, as quickly as it begins, a transient romance can end just as suddenly. An opening act for the melancholy symphony. But even in its brevity, it can leave a lasting impact on our souls. We become both student and teacher, we hold and feel held, we lean fearlessly into time’s consequence. Let us reel in its beauty and it struggles, its joys and its pains. As we somersault through life, let’s not forget that to lose a connection it must first be found.","popularity":0.0648,"poster_path":"/usYjOxEa3c1C31ak95CD6bkUQro.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":245475,"logo_path":null,"name":"Present Space","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Transience","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5076572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Schoellkopf","original_name":"Brian Schoellkopf","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"67419d59dae2e6a9382580b4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5076574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jarrod Takle","original_name":"Jarrod Takle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"67419d67aab722bfa7c8e0d8","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5076568,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Munnings","original_name":"Adam Munnings","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67419ad8015d2e0f702e215b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5076575,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sarah Hawkins","original_name":"Sarah Hawkins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67419d7edae2e6a9382580d4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3085108,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucas Fiederling","original_name":"Lucas Fiederling","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67419d92015d2e0f702e21b5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5076576,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andrew Holmes","original_name":"Andrew Holmes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67419da568823004ca9c7591","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3141282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paulina Radic","original_name":"Paulina Radic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67419db5dae2e6a9382580e0","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5076577,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Adam Rajab","original_name":"Adam Rajab","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67419dc0015d2e0f702e21cb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/usYjOxEa3c1C31ak95CD6bkUQro.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/muDm4nRfmEZjO6DRGkS5hLjmEA7.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
