The artist can hear the music through his earphones, but as viewers we are only privy to the sound of his voice that whispers the melody. As we listen to the hypnotic interpretion of the familiar songs - as emblematic for pop music history as 'Psycho' is for film - we are forced to mentally 'reconstruct' the remaining orchestration, instrumentation and vocals. We must attempt to reassemble something we already know to be a fact by negotiating the sticky mess of interpretation, meaning, and memory.","popularity":0.1904,"poster_path":"/m1EfnnziFM2B1Wrymxj9Muw4JoK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1993-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Douglas Gordon sings the best of Lou Reed & The Velvet Underground (For Bas Jan Ader)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Douglas Gordon","original_name":"Douglas Gordon","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67434fd76370ecad3f0005fa","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Douglas Gordon","original_name":"Douglas Gordon","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67434ffb1bcb2c093805cc14","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m1EfnnziFM2B1Wrymxj9Muw4JoK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12990,"name":"singing"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":208733,"name":"video art"},{"id":248309,"name":"performative"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1993-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
