The entire Bear family is a very neat, but Baby Bear is so particular that Momma Bear thinks he may be just a bit too fussy.  When Momma Bear cooks up a lovely bubbling pot of creamy porridge, they all agree that it's too hot to eat and decide to take a walk while it cools.  While they are away, Goldilocks, an unusually clusmy girl, stumbles upon and through Poppa Bear's  garden, crashes into the cottage, pirates the porridge, fouls up the furniture and finally falls asleep in Baby Bear's bunk. When the Bears return home they can't belive the damage, but Baby Bear has to laugh he sees the mess!","popularity":0.5292,"poster_path":"/uIu9N1IgSzoy8oLYXCHD92toqZ8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72838,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bevanfield Films","origin_country":""},{"id":245324,"logo_path":null,"name":"Castle Communications PLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A lovely adventure!","title":"Goldilocks and the three bears","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1458295,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geoffrey Matthews","original_name":"Geoffrey Matthews","popularity":0.099,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"67418df5015d2e0f702e1ed3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1319585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Timothy Forder","original_name":"Timothy Forder","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67418dba015d2e0f702e1ec9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3204740,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Rosemary Welch","original_name":"Rosemary Welch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67418e788b4e4c2ef6f7acb2","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2885642,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Paul Gunson","original_name":"Paul Gunson","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67418ea78b4e4c2ef6f7acc6","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1421164,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ian Henderson","original_name":"Ian Henderson","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67418fcf015d2e0f702e1eee","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2885641,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Dawn White","original_name":"Dawn White","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674190294dfa06b5df931a07","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5072129,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lyndon Pickersgill","original_name":"Lyndon Pickersgill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674190489f40a7aaf6ea0d6e","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5072130,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kick Production","original_name":"Kick Production","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674190614dfa06b5df931a1d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1273479,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mary Swindale","original_name":"Mary Swindale","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674190a09f40a7aaf6ea0dbd","department":"Production","job":"Production Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1319585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Timothy Forder","original_name":"Timothy Forder","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674190c04dfa06b5df931a49","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6009344","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.776,"height":732,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8rJSEGzwhILoygHor48OQejgSPX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1300}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1535,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dwOUkL3xe1dnfps1ekCHSa0IFJr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1023},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":953,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uIu9N1IgSzoy8oLYXCHD92toqZ8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":635}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":262531,"name":"goldilocks & the three bears"},{"id":297442,"name":"animation"},{"id":342665,"name":"bevanfield"},{"id":342757,"name":"ricitos"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Vhs premiere","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bevanfield's Goldilocks & The Three Bears","key":"Q1zwOyT76-k","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2019-05-06T17:54:28.000Z","id":"6741952f8b4e4c2ef6f7ae18"}]}}}
