He said he came from the USA, but he was from Orgal, a tiny village in the municipality of Vila Nova de Foz Côa. He was a funny kid. Over the years I lost track of him. Nine years later I met him in Lisbon. He was making a film, \"O Fantasma\". A great actor! Nominated for awards in Portugal and abroad. He couldn't handle the exposure. He totally decompensated. He died alone.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/n2rtTUtGJXDRmLe2hxp435vl2Yv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2024-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"É um Outro País","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5079523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carla Pinto","original_name":"Carla Pinto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"67435a597b825e685b4e9576","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5079517,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuel Santos Maia","original_name":"Manuel Santos Maia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674359a6cfd24c3a7aab6b4a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5079521,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ricardo Novais Pereira","original_name":"Ricardo Novais Pereira","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67435a3f83158b0b2647c59f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5079517,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuel Santos Maia","original_name":"Manuel Santos Maia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67435a4edae2e6a93825bd53","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5079517,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuel Santos Maia","original_name":"Manuel Santos Maia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6754ac25e3b9b3f9145514e9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5105028,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"João Ricardo","original_name":"João Ricardo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6754ac746f37f6e89adc3f5b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5079517,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuel Santos Maia","original_name":"Manuel Santos Maia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6754ac840564b1ea9b6eb20a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5105028,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"João Ricardo","original_name":"João Ricardo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6754ac9e6f37f6e89adc3f6e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5079517,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuel Santos Maia","original_name":"Manuel Santos Maia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6754acc9a7b2fcb11e524b6c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5105030,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Samuel Silva","original_name":"Samuel Silva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6754ace5237849767575547f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5079521,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ricardo Novais Pereira","original_name":"Ricardo Novais Pereira","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6754acfbfdba938e86365362","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31101757","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bgFAGMzC6eLovSGAOMpGiQk3aAh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hhantlTgi8PX4vRj7clgyUDFiD7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n2rtTUtGJXDRmLe2hxp435vl2Yv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"Cinema Fernando Lopes","release_date":"2024-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"Espaço Mira","release_date":"2021-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
