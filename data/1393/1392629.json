The staging reimagined the opera’s exploration of fidelity and deception against the backdrop of colonial-era Africa, addressing themes of power and exploitation. Honoré’s bold interpretation divided audiences, with some praising its daring approach and others finding it controversial. Conducted by Louis Langrée, the performance featured an exceptional cast, including Sandrine Piau, Lenneke Ruiten, and Kate Lindsey, whose vocal finesse and dramatic commitment brought vitality to Mozart’s intricate score. The inventive production blended historical commentary with the opera’s timeless emotional and comedic core, marking a memorable contribution to the festival’s legacy.","popularity":0.212,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":147031,"logo_path":null,"name":"Festival Aix-en-Provence","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":189,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Festival Aix-en-Provence","title":"Così fan tutte","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2148378,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lenneke Ruiten","original_name":"Lenneke Ruiten","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Fiordiligi","credit_id":"6743364dd8db7dd1ba456347","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1438030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Lindsey","original_name":"Kate Lindsey","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/yeGObPyxVfGvXF09DBsO42xwheW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dorabella","credit_id":"6743365c4d50ccd7da48ae45","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2472489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joel Prieto","original_name":"Joel Prieto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Ferrando","credit_id":"674336724c3822726f31ca0c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1629184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nahuel Di Pierro","original_name":"Nahuel Di Pierro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/kJz1r1Enm3hUSUnYkC8EuPQ42Jx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Guglielmo","credit_id":"674336824d50ccd7da48ae4c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1115341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodney Gilfry","original_name":"Rodney Gilfry","popularity":0.0498,"profile_path":"/jPQJ6OkMQYYhKqdZrgcLoTJlq7R.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Don Alfonso","credit_id":"674336916370ecad3f00026e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1563177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandrine Piau","original_name":"Sandrine Piau","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/oTvtZoc68tqNPoEvQLz8OUxw8TS.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Despina","credit_id":"6743369f7b825e685b4e8f5b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Langrée","original_name":"Louis Langrée","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"67433b32cfd24c3a7aab65bd","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18170,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","original_name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":"/p4ueHlbsBraC1AMAGDCYJJ5L9cw.jpg","credit_id":"674336c0d8db7dd1ba4563a1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76910,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christophe Honoré","original_name":"Christophe Honoré","popularity":0.4225,"profile_path":"/vhRdx5xeSjlB6lPfXsnc0L3g02g.jpg","credit_id":"674336d18b4e4c2ef6f7e4f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2016-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
