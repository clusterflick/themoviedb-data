To prevent the eradication of the human species, the government has imposed the permanent isolation of adults, two by two, in cement chambers located in the heart of underground facilities. Locked up together for years, an ambitious young man and a good-natured old man have the daily task of turning valves fixed to the wall to distribute drinking water to a thirsty population. A chance reunion with a childhood friend could allow the young man to realize his dream of escaping their cell... and lead them to finally see the light of day.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/qF1FM9G875J1x0RSwM5jP9XX619.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":289804,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lost Production","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2025-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monde Souterrain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6017368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yves Cormier","original_name":"Yves Cormier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"699687aa4dc463a6f46f810a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6017369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Ferniot","original_name":"Victor Ferniot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"699687b3a2311d663d2871b8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6017370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mélissa Nolfo","original_name":"Mélissa Nolfo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"699687ba918f9da4ef2871ba","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6017361,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bauçan","original_name":"Bauçan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"699687539ba04913d33c8f03","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6017361,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bauçan","original_name":"Bauçan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6996875aa2311d663d2871ae","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6017365,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Francis Breton","original_name":"Francis Breton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69968786e26c8b05773df2a5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6017365,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Francis Breton","original_name":"Francis Breton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6996878f62fa1ac8e484ff79","department":"Crew","job":"Special Effects"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.753,"height":929,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qF1FM9G875J1x0RSwM5jP9XX619.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Fantasia Film Festival 2025","release_date":"2025-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
