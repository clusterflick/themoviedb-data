Surrounded by handmade voodoo dolls and walls covered in symbols, he prepares a new doll using hair and a piece of clothing taken from his chosen subject. As he slices the doll’s neck with a razor, a matching wound appears on his own body. Victor bleeds out in shock and triumph, collapsing onto the floor where the failed dolls from earlier experiments lie scattered. His camera captures the moment of his death, confirming that the ritual has finally worked.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Doll Experiment","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1990253,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iris Almaraz","original_name":"Iris Almaraz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69968748889bd86477851a97","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
