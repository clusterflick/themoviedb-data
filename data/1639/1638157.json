They were a musician named MARKUS TALAM in a Buru Island concentration camp prison for 10 years, a radioman named SUKIMAN and an ordinary farmer named SUYATMAN both were detained in Blitar, East Java prison for 1 year, all without a judicial process. A military operation codenamed “TRISULA” was carried out in the South Blitar area, East Java, to purge the remnants of the members of Indonesian Communist Party (PKI). They weren’t communists, just ordinary farmers who had been caught in that military operation, some of their family members were killed and tortured. Trauma haunts them throughout their lives and justice never served them. Through whispered stories, they hope that in their twilight they will get justice to restore political and citizen rights that were seized by the regime. This film is a story of a long and winding road with a big question, will justice come to those who are oppressed?","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":300000,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Last Supper (Whisper)","title":"The Last Supper (Whisper)","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
