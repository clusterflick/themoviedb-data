This venue, also known as The Fab Mab was somewhat of a legendary venue.  It saw the likes of The Runaways, Ramones, The Dead Boys and even Motorhead stretch their strings there. So what better place for the Dead Kennedys to launch their assault onto the world.  The Dead Kennedys would be formed through The Recycler. A now legendary newspaper that brought many influential groups together. Metallica, Guns N Roses and Motley Crue all started from classified ads here.  Whilst of course the Kennedys were a full band, one man would essentially become the spokesperson for the group and his name would become synonymous with them. You can’t hear the name Jello Biafra without thinking of the politics behind Dead Kennedys.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/hZ0m3fZ5Ph8fiOZ2KCmVlwmU2Kx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hell Nation - The Story of Dead Kennedys","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jello Biafra","original_name":"Jello Biafra","popularity":0.6923,"profile_path":"/ddoHZlkbI9WbimJRjIigwfQDlMm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"69972c333590c752a5850226","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"East Bay Ray","original_name":"East Bay Ray","popularity":0.1902,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"69972c569ba04913d33c91ac","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klaus Flouride","original_name":"Klaus Flouride","popularity":0.3306,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"69972c6e7d0d5a59881ae9d6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2513256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"D.H.
