The beginning of the film is illustrated by Repe's long rally \"Leave, leave for the fells\", which is probably not recorded anywhere else but in this film. \"You can forget about the bag of crumbs during the trip, only when you arrive can you have a nice rest...\" In the final part, Tapsa performs his bravura, Rakovalkea, written by Repe at night by fire: \"It is night and the stars in the sky shine brightly, the moon shines brightly on the fells... This land of ice and snow, it fascinates, enchants, and my mind keeps returning here.\"","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Laulu tunturille","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2316809","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
