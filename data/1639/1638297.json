With the festival entering its seventh year they invite their friend and filmmaker David Kew to make a documentary about their extraordinary life on the island. But when Sergei suddenly disappears without trace on Papa Westray three months into filming, the filmmaker is forced to embark on a profound journey of discovery and contemplation. As the filmmaker interviews those left behind each in their own way trying to make sense of Sergei's vanishing, the film gravitates towards Iszman as she attempts to come to terms with her grief by creating an elegiac and moving tribute to Sergei on the island.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/2TpUsTBwFS4Tr1t2kuQxa1hVoM2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"The Artist Who Disappeared","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2381912,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Armando Seijo","original_name":"Armando Seijo","popularity":0.4844,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"699708c69ba04913d33c90b0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6018066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Dolphijn","original_name":"Rick Dolphijn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"699708cf4989f213f33c9371","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6018067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Muir","original_name":"Tom Muir","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"699708ec04d9864d18863912","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6018069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergei Ivanov","original_name":"Sergei Ivanov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"699709030abcf1755d3df39d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6018065,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Kew","original_name":"David Kew","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"699708b2d9d38d18dcc854f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10376442","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2TpUsTBwFS4Tr1t2kuQxa1hVoM2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":731}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2026-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
