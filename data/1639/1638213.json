But when Chioma's phone lights up with a message from the man she's been \"talking to,\" something shifts. What begins as playful banter slowly turns into something more fragile. Beneath the laughter and kitchen chaos, Femi must confront feelings he has carefully buried, while Chioma wrestles with the safety of their friendship versus the possibility of something deeper. As the pancakes cook and tension rises, a single impulsive moment forces them to ask the question they've both been avoiding: are they just friends, or have they been pretending all along? In a story set entirely within the intimacy of a kitchen, Let's Make Pancakes explores vulnerability, timing, and the quiet risks required to choose love over comfort.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"they were just making pancakes... until feelings flipped","title":"Lets makePancake","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt39975727","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
