Instead, he is quietly interrogated, mocked, and reminded of his lower status by her friends, who see him only as a supplier, not an equal. The evening takes a darker turn when figures from the city's criminal underworld unexpectedly enter the space, bringing unresolved tensions and unspoken threats with them. As pressure builds from all sides, Alex finds himself trapped between social humiliation, criminal control, and his own desire for dignity. Over the course of one night, the lines between power and powerlessness blur, forcing Alex to confront the cost of the choices he has made and the consequences of the world he is trying to survive in.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Every choice has a price","title":"The Deal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6020220,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Imran Shaik","original_name":"Imran Shaik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69987612e87b1210f8ba3b48","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36981197","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
