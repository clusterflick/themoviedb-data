Composed entirely of original video fragments created for the kinetic scenography of a stage production by the Czech National Theatre's Laterna Magika, the film avoids wide shots and focuses on intimate details—skin, breath, joints, and movement. Each chapter mirrors a season, reflecting cycles of birth, vitality, decay, and stillness, forming an abstract visual poem on time and transformation.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Land of Body","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2389054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tereza Vejvodová","original_name":"Tereza Vejvodová","popularity":0.1166,"profile_path":"/q3FdCZBCFyg4T69a3zSWhP9Cc1t.jpg","credit_id":"69982fccd5860e23d07341b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wNDK7zDdQz6Sz0bfz0wazzOxiUo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"exact date unknown","release_date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Chiayi International Art Doc Film Festival","release_date":"2026-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
