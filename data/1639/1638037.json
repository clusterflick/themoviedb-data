Heeding an urgent call from his uncle, Collin has an adventure that opens his eyes to his Uncle’s tragic past of false incarceration stemming from generations of racism.  As the road unwinds, together they overcome the obstacles that are thrust in their way both externally and internally by ghosts from his uncle’s dark past. With grim determination and humor these two men bond together forever marking young Collin as he finally steps into manhood.  Jeffrey’s Turn with its universal message of coming to terms with your past while learning to live in the present is both hopeful but realistic in its portrayal of living as a Mi’kmag man in today’s society","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"JEFFREY'S TURN","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6017052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zeegwon Shilling","original_name":"Zeegwon Shilling","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"JR","credit_id":"6996645fee0d9508db6f6471","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6017054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Dove","original_name":"Grace Dove","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Anna","credit_id":"6996647d3b85058f2f3df252","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6017056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glen Gould","original_name":"Glen Gould","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Arty","credit_id":"699664993eaf943c6f863700","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6017057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sidney Francis","original_name":"Sidney Francis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Te'skum","credit_id":"699664b17c9082cc993df1a6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6017059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandon Oakes","original_name":"Brandon Oakes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Uncle Joe","credit_id":"699664c77c9082cc993df1b2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6017062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Skerry","original_name":"Sean Skerry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mitch","credit_id":"699664df351ad2b1ac28712f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6017065,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pamela Matthews","original_name":"Pamela Matthews","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Justine","credit_id":"699664f302e7f556ba288d4b","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6017072,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hank White","original_name":"Hank White","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"699665619ba04913d33c8e3b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6017074,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Richard MacQueen","original_name":"Richard MacQueen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"699665a10da21052713df1bf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6017076,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Glen Gould","original_name":"Glen Gould","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"699665bc2aa33ebcf04a938a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6017078,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marty Williams","original_name":"Marty Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"699665d3c6af8d459f6f80ad","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6017079,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thom Fitzgerald","original_name":"Thom Fitzgerald","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"699665ef18e82e4f816f63a6","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6017081,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Doug Pettigrew","original_name":"Doug Pettigrew","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69966658a8b17c10e0863615","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6476786","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
