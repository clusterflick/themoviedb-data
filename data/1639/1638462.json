On May 20, 2021, the X-Press Pearl container ship caught fire off the coast of Colombo, carrying 9,700 tons of potentially hazardous chemicals, oil, and epoxy resins. This tragedy also led to the world's largest-ever nurdle spill, with 87 containers releasing approximately 1,680 metric tons of plastic pellets into the ocean. Through contemporary dance and experimental filmmaking, the movie portrays the journey of a pearl oyster as it struggles to safeguard its precious pearl from the impacts of the X-Press Pearl disaster.  —Tharindu Ramanayaka","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/xFZwMZcJSnafwvZ4YNxT36qfq4T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This is not a Pearl","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6018660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ama Nethmi","original_name":"Ama Nethmi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Pearl Oyster","credit_id":"69975522e5bd016ac2a7262d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6018663,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tharindu Ramanayaka","original_name":"Tharindu Ramanayaka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6997554bb3e7310038ab8c8d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6018669,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ama Nethmi","original_name":"Ama Nethmi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69975590e727ba74f413b9fa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6018672,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tharindu Ramanayaka","original_name":"Tharindu Ramanayaka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"699755a5ab0047a81213ba47","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5122316,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kularuwan Gamage","original_name":"Kularuwan Gamage","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"699755e2d798b5bff2c9924c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6018687,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dilantha Perera","original_name":"Dilantha Perera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6997562adcd7754545d2c853","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5868221,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nadika Weligodapola","original_name":"Nadika Weligodapola","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/ruTKScUE2m1hGJO1BmUHzVPn9ju.jpg","credit_id":"6997567aa52253853f66623c","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31491055","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"61556466697249","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1024,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xFZwMZcJSnafwvZ4YNxT36qfq4T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":683}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐢𝐬 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐚 𝐏𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐥  - Official Trailer","key":"MZSDHopXzv8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-06-16T14:30:07.000Z","id":"69975860afd018cf49666281"}]}}}
