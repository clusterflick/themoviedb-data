All growth here remains low, both of people and other life. Here, you have to stay close to the surface of the ground so that the freezing wind doesn't cut the tops.\" Suomi-Film's film crew in the spring landscapes of Fell Lapland's Yliperä hiking towards the end point, the peak of the \"holy fell\" Halti.
