Filming spanned India, Thailand, Amsterdam, and Colorado, capturing the plant's cultural, economic, and scientific narratives across diverse landscapes. The project blends authentic footage with AI-generated imagery along with its creative interpretation. Through a non-intrusive filming style and a non-linear timeline, the film merges realism with metaphorical and abstract sequences, delving into cannabis' roles—from ancient spiritual rituals in India to modern medical applications in Thailand and global substance abuse challenges—while reflecting on the plant's enduring mysteries.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/XOLC3zpuGyQ2IF09lOToLzfkNC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2025-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Human-Cannabis III: Tracing Green","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","title":"人麻三部終章：逐綠","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6020164,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jawshing Arthur Liou","original_name":"劉肇興","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69986a20864c80684ec99639","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":800,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/XOLC3zpuGyQ2IF09lOToLzfkNC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Taiwan Contemporary Culture Lab","release_date":"2025-05-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Chiayi International Art Doc Film Festival","release_date":"2026-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Human Cannabis III, TRACING GREEN","key":"1040931485","site":"Vimeo","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-12-19T22:02:31.000Z","id":"69986a38f24df7e6236669c0"}]}}}
