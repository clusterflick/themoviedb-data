Located right on a cross of different gang territories, it became associated with drugs, violence, and its diverse homeless population: undocumented immigrants, abandoned veterans, transgenders, people who lost their job, and people with disabilities who can’t afford healthcare.\r For a course of 3 months, I visited MacArthur Park filming those who live there. Many of those people came to the US with a dream to find heaven. And LA indeed looks like one. My goal was to show this dramatic contrast between heaven and its tragedy.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Portrait of unhoused lives in Los Angeles.","title":"Homeless Angels","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3111225,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anatoliy Ulyanov","original_name":"Anatoliy Ulyanov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/auwwasGAEnZbX5HryarPfFeyZUg.jpg","credit_id":"6997308cd9d38d18dcc855b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2981,"name":"homelessness"},{"id":368200,"name":"macarthur park"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
