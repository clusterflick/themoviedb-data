Shu, born into privilege, is a gentle but drifting lawyer who dreams of a slower, unburdened existence. The two first met in a high school band and, years later, reunite, marry, and choose to bring new life into the world. Confined to a delivery room and an extended period of waiting, the couple are forced into difficult honesty. What begins as an intimate ordeal gradually expands into a pressure cooker of family drama, where unspoken expectations and old wounds refuse to stay contained. The arrival of family members and a former lover brings long-suppressed tensions to the surface. Over the course of 36 hours, before the child is born, the marriage is pushed to a breaking point—opening the possibility of change, responsibility, and renewal—at a moment when life and death feel perilously near, and yet nothing is certain.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Labour of Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1258375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Chen","original_name":"陳庭妮","popularity":1.0809,"profile_path":"/3H9URUQiFbcn1PvwV77KszIBExD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"69971f70c07669b5444a965b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2033784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fu Meng-Po","original_name":"傅孟柏","popularity":1.1797,"profile_path":"/efznd3HAadw6hF9Ir9Xz1xEyFif.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"69971f761b9d61da533df58f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1576095,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Hsin","original_name":"辛建宗","popularity":0.1386,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69971f68233cc35521c85574","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
