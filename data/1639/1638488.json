Through vivid field recordings and intricate depictions of sacred rituals, it immerses viewers in the profound connection between sound and the human experience. At its core, SWARAM looks into Kerala’s ritualistic art forms—Thottam Pattu, Pulluvan Pattu, and Kalamezhuthu Pattu—examining how rhythm and sound evoke trance states and facilitate spiritual transformation. It also blends ancient traditions with contemporary sonic explorations.  Structured as a visual research publication, the film adopts the format of an academic paper, with distinct sections such as Backdrop, Abstract, Introduction, Case Studies, Conclusion, and Expert References. This unique approach seamlessly blends research with cinematic storytelling, offering viewers both an academic exploration and an immersive cinematic experience.","popularity":0.0786,"poster_path":"/dBhWfe3J2SMudCHajZS1RZ9MuTP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":289866,"logo_path":null,"name":"Indian Institute of Technology - Hyderabad","origin_country":""},{"id":289867,"logo_path":null,"name":"Department of Design - IIT Hyderabad","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2024-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Malayalam","iso_639_1":"ml","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Journey into the Ritualistic Soundscapes and Trance States","title":"SWARAM","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6018793,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lijin Lohithakshan","original_name":"Lijin Lohithakshan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6997647d2284daf442ba350d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6018793,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lijin Lohithakshan","original_name":"Lijin Lohithakshan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"699764912cb3520cdc3022f8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6018793,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lijin Lohithakshan","original_name":"Lijin Lohithakshan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"699764a830a8af20adab8d03","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6018793,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lijin Lohithakshan","original_name":"Lijin Lohithakshan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"699767b82429d4709e733e49","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dBhWfe3J2SMudCHajZS1RZ9MuTP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":174109,"name":"documentary filmmaking"},{"id":237362,"name":"soundscape"},{"id":287803,"name":"experimental cinema"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"SWARAM: The Sacred Rhythms of Kerala | An Experimental Cinematic Documentary","key":"bSztqM1gYzc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-03-26T09:15:39.000Z","id":"69976ae85205163e0aa726fe"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"SWARAM Video Intro Abstract","key":"BznMY-lxSEQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-03-26T03:23:34.000Z","id":"69976538aea827ecbdba35b5"}]}}}
