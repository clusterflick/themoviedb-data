Shot in a single day by a rag-tag team of actors, camera operators and directors (usually taking multiple roles each), it explores the timeless themes of friendship and identity through the setting of a final college assignment.  The protagonists meet at one of their places for a final replacement assignment for their 'Professional Development' course. They all have different reasons to be anxious about their futures as their university time draws to an end. The energy and fun bursts off the screen as they get to know each other, sing together, dance together and eventually grow together.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Breakfast Club","title":"The Second Breakfast Club","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
