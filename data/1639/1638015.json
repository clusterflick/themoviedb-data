Due to deforestation, Thailand’s forests are vanishing, and hornbills are losing the ancient trees they depend on to nest. When Yanin first hears a hornbill's call, it becomes a call to action. With access to her family's polymer lab and support from Thailand's Hornbill Research Foundation, she helps develop a new artificial nest, which was then installed on Yao Noi Island, where nesting is in crisis.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ykvP4SXCinQ3nxoHpqF3XJnt2VC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2025-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Homes for Hornbills","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6016946,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yanin Tangkaravakoon","original_name":"Yanin Tangkaravakoon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69965412e26c8b05773df197","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ykvP4SXCinQ3nxoHpqF3XJnt2VC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Colorado Environmental Film Festival","release_date":"2026-02-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"tve Global Sustainability Film Awards 2025","release_date":"2025-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
