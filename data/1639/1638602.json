Their search takes them on a thrilling quest - by motorcycle, airplane, boat, and horseback - to recreate the historic, unprecedented expedition across Baja. They meet Mexican scientists, hospitable and vibrant locals, and are even greeted by old friends. But beneath Baja's unwavering friendly and peaceful demeanor, many Baja Californians hint at a darker story that threatens their home and way of life.  Realizing that the Baja of old has changed, the crew encounters the results of overfishing, destructive resource extraction, the excesses of tourism, and blatant pollution. Nevertheless, the crew captures stories of hope and aims to understand how lessons from the past can help us find a way forward.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":289900,"logo_path":null,"name":"Broken Wagon Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"One family's quest to recreate a historical expedition through Baja California.","title":"The Devil’s Road: A Baja Adventure","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6019226,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"JT Bruce","original_name":"JT Bruce","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6997a808742cf953623023bc","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6019228,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Todd Bruce","original_name":"Todd Bruce","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6997a854a5dbd323ea30245f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6019234,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bri Bruce","original_name":"Bri Bruce","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6997a94c0c55782365ab8e47","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6019235,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Greg Meyer","original_name":"Greg Meyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6997a97ae5b43a9f5fab8e9e","department":"Crew","job":"Scientific Consultant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
