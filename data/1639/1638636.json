As the image — composed of film excerpts, behind-the-scenes footage, conversations, and personal archives — reveals both the inner workings and the hidden underside of their collaboration in cinema and in life, the narration unfolds as a dual biography, reflecting on love, obsession, the passage of time, and death.  Guided by a profound desire to truly encounter the other, Mon amour, c’est pour le restant de mes jours is a love letter, a diary of everyday life, and a resolutely feminist proposition: one that envisions creation as a plural, shared act.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mon amour, c’est pour le restant de mes jours","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1037327,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"André-Line Beauparlant","original_name":"André-Line Beauparlant","popularity":1.1819,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6997bc094f7f91796e3024a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
