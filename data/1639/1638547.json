Set almost entirely inside an ordinary residence, the film investigates the invisible emotional violence that settles into family and intimate relationships. The narrative follows a young woman surrounded by figures who move between care and control, love and manipulation. Small gestures, prolonged silences, and restrained conflicts build an oppressive atmosphere in which terror does not manifest through jump scares or graphic effects, but through the gradual deterioration of sanity. With a raw, sensory, and minimalist approach, DISCOMFORT proposes an immersive cinematic experience that shifts horror into the emotional realm, exploring themes such as psychological abuse, emotional dependency, identity, and survival. The film invites the viewer to confront a discomfort that does not resolve — it only accumulates.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/cirJbzAvdDTdybcvhkO1QJR4hsm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"DISCOMFORT","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5785600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joelma Neves","original_name":"Joelma Neves","popularity":0.1357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Mãe","credit_id":"69977fe6b796f9801e6662dc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3266304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriela Moulaz","original_name":"Gabriela Moulaz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Filha","credit_id":"69977ff5152478852bab8dce","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3266290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aluísio Brandão","original_name":"Aluísio Brandão","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Abel","credit_id":"69978003d0c8c6aad7ba35cd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6019001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guido Lecogue","original_name":"Guido Lecogue","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Cliente","credit_id":"69978017b9e6b93efea726c4","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3266281,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ricky Foline","original_name":"Ricky Foline","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6997803374e5fe2189c99311","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3266281,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ricky Foline","original_name":"Ricky Foline","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69978047dcd7754545d2c9a1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3266281,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ricky Foline","original_name":"Ricky Foline","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6997805c6e9eff2880a726ee","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt39983035","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1600,"iso_3166_1":"BR","iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/cirJbzAvdDTdybcvhkO1QJR4hsm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1066}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2026-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
