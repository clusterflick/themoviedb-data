A musician invites them to sing lullabies. Within the intimate setting of these workshops, they reconnect with buried emotions and memories. These lullabies resonate with their testimony on the complexity of paternity from a great distance and life between two countries. From far away, the voice of a child tells us the father's lack and the wound of separation.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/iraZFHo1uGZ0PVCKZ3UwHKxYoKn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rajaa, That Means Hope","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4527858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marielle Duclos","original_name":"Marielle Duclos","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68011fa4b113ff8723d965c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4527858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marielle Duclos","original_name":"Marielle Duclos","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68011fb161b1c4bb3299f886","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5070209,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Camille Fougère","original_name":"Camille Fougère","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68011fc4de5e4dec62af0eec","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12390308","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/iraZFHo1uGZ0PVCKZ3UwHKxYoKn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"OKO International Etnographic Film Festival","release_date":"2020-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
