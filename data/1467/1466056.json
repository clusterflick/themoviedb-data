Days before the premiere, he is thrust into the spotlight, and rehearsals become a fragile dance between memory and reality. Shadows of his childhood in a war-torn homeland resurface—memories of a lost twin brother, Ahmad, and an orange grove torn apart by conflict. As Aziz delves deeper into his role, his own anguish bleeds into the performance. The play’s director sees a rare, unguarded truth in Aziz’s portrayal, unaware of the profound personal wounds that lie beneath it. On opening night, Aziz’s grief and guilt transform his performance into a raw, cathartic journey. Through the act of storytelling, he confronts the fractured pieces of his identity, merging the past with the present and finding a bittersweet peace in honoring his brother’s memory.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":8117,"logo_path":"/eVsVPEZRK63zsQMxxSHf5Cv017g.png","name":"Max Films","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":157609,"logo_path":"/5OgcjO2yZe8QzV2st8ug4MArICG.png","name":"The Imaginarium Films","origin_country":"JO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"JO","name":"Jordan"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"The Orange Grove","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2944938,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Murad Abu Eisheh","original_name":"Murad Abu Eisheh","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6800facdef5ae687cbd9e31c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38517,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roger Frappier","original_name":"Roger Frappier","popularity":0.0828,"profile_path":"/kYh5KSknAQf7JQ4lRDd59UmQVFw.jpg","credit_id":"6800fad4aacf7cfb269a3019","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4796234,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Veronika Molnar","original_name":"Veronika Molnar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6800fadbaacf7cfb269a301e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1456312,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sylvie Lacoste","original_name":"Sylvie Lacoste","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6800fae1ef5ae687cbd9e32d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uZdRH4Xij0vgoRfhyXGNyDbfcYt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
