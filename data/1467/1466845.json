The death of a fish awakens the sorrows of a lifetime. The Mother’s great losses take shape in the form of doubles, drawing her toward the center of a pond where her depression crystallizes. The Daughter uses dance to hold her back, as words seem devoid of meaning. The figure of a Heron, both symbolic and ordinary, urges the girl to accept her powerlessness and find her place.","popularity":0.0443,"poster_path":"/1GWpm57CLNVJHa1zYcxojiKJlRu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2025-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Death of the Fish","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2392688,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eva Lusbaronian","original_name":"Eva Lusbaronian","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6802ebd14315ae6d9aacf412","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36582083","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s0OvlfO3dcpITxATEEk8hZSaLoT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1GWpm57CLNVJHa1zYcxojiKJlRu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":908}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Quinzaine des Cineastes","release_date":"2025-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
