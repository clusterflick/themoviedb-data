This experimental journey seeks to liberate individuals from conventional notions of sex, urging a profound connection with one’s own erotic power as a life force. By delving into the rich tapestry and amplifying the voices and diverse experiences of disabled individuals, the film celebrates a crip sexual culture, broadening our constrained definitions of sex. The narrative dismantles normative beliefs, questioning the entrenched notion that nondisabled, heteronormative sex is the sole and default expression of intimacy. Ultimately, the film advocates for a centering of pleasure and joy as a lifeforce, strongly influenced by the great activists and writers adrienne marie brown, Audre Lorde, Shayda Kafai, Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha and Ingrid LaFleur.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"CripPleasurePower","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5378874,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"ari sinn","original_name":"ari sinn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68013db3f39c730125d96d47","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
