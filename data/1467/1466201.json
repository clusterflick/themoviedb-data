But instead of darkness, he is thrown into a hallucinatory limbo where time, memories, and nightmares melt together. Here, he is haunted by grotesque, symbol-laden creatures that mirror his own inner demons – fear, guilt, and the scars of violence on his soul.  As he fights his way through this surreal dreamscape, he experiences his own body mutating, transforming into something monstrous – a physical manifestation of his inner decay. The horrors of war have shaped him, but how much of his humanity remains?  With intense visual experimentation and a nerve-wracking narrative, Waking in Oblivion explores the boundary between nightmare and reality, between guilt and redemption. Can John Will break free from his inner prison, or will he be forever trapped in the shadow of war?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":259723,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kofal Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Waking in Oblivion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Vågner i Glemslen","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5378971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lars Mikkes","original_name":"Lars Mikkes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6801470aaacf7cfb269a3f7d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
