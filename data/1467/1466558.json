Through stop-motion animation and poetry, the film uses land-based artifacts to reflect the desert and the people who withstand harsh distances through rooted traditions of mobility. Each animated image evokes the earthâ€™s imposed complicity in the severance of border-dwelling families, yet also its role in the methods of care and closeness that sustain the rebellion inherent in loving across borders.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Border Dweller Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2352625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Asherman","original_name":"Laura Asherman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680257fd65c00a25a5d93df5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5380313,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Flores","original_name":"Anna Flores","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680258122c85e7966399b243","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
