Her practice is distinguished as well by her commitment to a particular way of presenting her work in public: generally projecting the films herself from within the screening space, Fanderl conceives of each screening program as a unique “montage” of individual works that together comprise a kind of ephemeral, never-to-be-repeated “film” in their own right (an approach made possible by the sheer multitude of pieces she’s created over the years). — Anthology Film Archives","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/m8AZntdfQAz1DVPO7ZRSOvpwLgC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Constellations Super 8 (2000-2024)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m8AZntdfQAz1DVPO7ZRSOvpwLgC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
