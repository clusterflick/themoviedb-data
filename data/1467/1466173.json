Nine-year-old Bilal, mischievous and daring, is pursued by a farmer after stealing a melon. He hides, terrified by the scarecrows he mistakes for his pursuer. After his sheep causes trouble in the village, Brahim, a 60-year-old villager, tries to turn himself in but backs down in the face of authority. Taja, 75, sells her jewelry to pay for having her traditional tattoos removed, fearing divine punishment. Meanwhile, Dalila and Omar, in love, hide from the eyes of Dalila's family, fighting off fears of an honor killing. As their paths cross one by one, the cornfield becomes a place of confrontation and reconciliation, culminating in a wedding celebration. Taja offers her jewels as a gift to the young lovers, sealing their fates.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":117431,"logo_path":"/4EJyUkz8IEGs88uSZygWzY8ydti.png","name":"Le Moindre Geste","origin_country":"MA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"The Field","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5215635,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Imad Benomar","original_name":"Imad Benomar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6801356291d3f65c5face111","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2790367,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mohamed Bouhari","original_name":"Mohamed Bouhari","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6801356865c00a25a5d90b96","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34729560","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
