Of Spanish and Moroccan heritage, she embarks on a trip to volunteer in Morocco after undergoing a personal crisis. Upon arriving at the Red Moon headquarters, she encounters a group of volunteers from various countries and travels with a caravan to a remote, conservative village in Morocco, where nothing ever seems to happen and the marriage of young Batool and Bashir is the event of the year. The caravan arrives, intent on providing a space to offer sex education, which Nadia leads. The presence of the caravan interrupts the villagers’ routine and divides them into two camps, leading to a confrontation and putting the long-awaited wedding at risk. In parallel, Nadia is on her own journey, getting closer to her origins and starting to believe in love again thanks to Khaled, a teacher who has just arrived in the village.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":259711,"logo_path":"/qyoxOze2HCRFe6qvywiLPi48KJO.png","name":"Apostrophe Films","origin_country":"MA"},{"id":259712,"logo_path":null,"name":"Berebera Films","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Fatwa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1114072,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ana Rodríguez Rosell","original_name":"Ana Rodríguez Rosell","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680133fb2c85e796639982e9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2881144,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mohamed El Badaoui","original_name":"Mohamed El Badaoui","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680134052c85e796639982ec","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2881144,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mohamed El Badaoui","original_name":"Mohamed El Badaoui","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680134bd2c85e7966399832f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cU4sBRa31QwxTITpY1xuJZhZjp6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
