It would be the first one in the country. One year later, WQED Pittsburgh was on the air and making broadcast history. The Best of WQED showcases some of t he station's earliest programs including \"The Children's Corner,\" with Josie Carey and Fred Rogers. Rare archival footage and photographs take viewers on a journey through the early days of television and reintroduces them to the people and programs that became part of the lives of thousands of Pittsburghers. The Best of WQED is hosted by WQED Cooks' Chris Fennimore and features seldom-seen footage of everyone from Art Rooney Sr. to Martha Graham to early Rick Sebak to the Great TV Auction.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":16021,"logo_path":"/2bjAiWiyI4nUWzxLcnGejDO0amC.png","name":"WQED","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Best of WQED","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3941583,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Fennimore","original_name":"Chris Fennimore","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6802eaa765c00a25a5d963f9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2656025,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Minette Seate","original_name":"Minette Seate","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6802e903e03207d0b1d94835","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2656138,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Frank Caloiero","original_name":"Frank Caloiero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6802e95ab13410cdc79926c5","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5381106,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Walt Francis","original_name":"Walt Francis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6802e96ab13410cdc79926d0","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2655865,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Bob Lubomski","original_name":"Bob Lubomski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6802e97b65c00a25a5d9638a","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2658719,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alisyn Blackwell","original_name":"Alisyn Blackwell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6802e996b13410cdc79926db","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2655914,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Paula Zetter","original_name":"Paula Zetter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6802e9ad61b1c4bb329a4cfc","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2655940,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kevin Conrad","original_name":"Kevin Conrad","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6802e9eeb13410cdc79926ec","department":"Editing","job":"Editorial Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5381108,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Luke Furedy","original_name":"Luke Furedy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6802ea0de506a8e3a0ad5ec0","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4021574,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Christa Majoras","original_name":"Christa Majoras","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6802ea22b113ff8723d9b8e7","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2658717,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rebecca Born","original_name":"Rebecca Born","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6802ea3465c00a25a5d963be","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5381111,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"George Hazimanolis","original_name":"George Hazimanolis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6802ea885570cba9e1acff9e","department":"Production","job":"Publicist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":193594,"name":"pittsburgh, pennsylvania"},{"id":254108,"name":"local television"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
