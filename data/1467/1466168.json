Yet, at the age of 23, she won the Madrid Open, one of the most prestigious tournaments in the world. She bested some of the biggest names in women's tennis, including Venus Williams, Justine Henin, and Marion Bartoli. The road to being named world champion was open to her. Then, at 24, she disappeared from the circuit overnight. Today, Rézaï is 37 and making a comeback, aiming to return to the world's top 10. To get there, she has called on her old coach: her father, the man behind her past success—and suffering. Through the prism of this sporting challenge, And Still I Rise examines the relationship between a father and his daughter, and her ability to achieve emancipation.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":207,"logo_path":"/uskenzq65wJe0cT0D8StQI3hJnO.png","name":"Agat Films & Cie / Ex Nihilo","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"And Still I Rise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5378827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aravane Rézaï","original_name":"Aravane Rézaï","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"680133784f59c24c0dad38ae","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5378830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arsalan Rezaï","original_name":"Arsalan Rezaï","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"680133902c85e796639982db","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2294424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Djanis Bouzyani","original_name":"Djanis Bouzyani","popularity":0.1041,"profile_path":"/9E00wRHlLR1ZdzDGGOm5UG14Xle.jpg","credit_id":"6801334fe506a8e3a0ad03f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1797398,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Coujard","original_name":"David Coujard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680133572e8958f0f9994c87","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qYjurimOlFiZUaUknoDbbsMBlW4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
