Billy’s longtime friends, Larry and Cynthia, try to talk him off a ledge in his dread of this years’ holiday. And in a feat to drink away his sorrows, he literally stumbles upon high powered lawyer, Harmony Davis. Though brief, their first encounter over chicken wings and a series of jokes turns to an unlikely romance that leads Billy to invite her to Christmas dinner. James, Haley and friends travel from separate coasts, dealing with delays, cancellations and daddy issues as their parents navigate their own past and pettiness.","popularity":0.1674,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":105244,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mo-tivation Unlimited","origin_country":""},{"id":259741,"logo_path":null,"name":"PattersonHouse Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":259742,"logo_path":null,"name":"Simpson & McGowan Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"#WorstChristmasEver","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1214865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"B.J.
