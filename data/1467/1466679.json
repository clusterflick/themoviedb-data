The film also reflects on the social conditioning of women to second guess their intuition, which oftentimes leads women to ignore and repress the red flags that pop up when danger is lurking. A number of years ago, I had to clean houses to make ends meet.  I felt and saw red flags while cleaning strangers' houses daily, and each time I struggled with the reality that if I listened to my gut I would not get paid. That is the decision women in this country must make every day and unfortunately most have to choose the paycheck over their own safety","popularity":0.0529,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Maid","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14721530","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
