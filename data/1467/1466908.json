Fifteen years later, the school has swelled to 7200 pupils and is a resounding success not least on account of its inspired, child-centred approach to teaching (known as CCA) as well as the integral role played by teachers, parents and income-generating vocational training programmes.  In this lively portrait, the school's abbot and several of Paungdaw Oo's teachers – many of whom were once pupils there themselves – talk about the school's CCA concept, the astonishing benefits of encouraging children to think for themselves, and how these methods can be a model for schools across Myanmar.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/2haM9foZMukKCNECmcpnKKfchzC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MM","name":"Myanmar"}],"release_date":"2009-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Burmese","iso_639_1":"my","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Bright Future","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2523974,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shin Daewe","original_name":"Shin Daewe","popularity":0.0784,"profile_path":"/hs8dOY17dMSHvifVPbDKi4LpxRy.jpg","credit_id":"680327585570cba9e1ad0954","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2383443,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thu Thu Shein","original_name":"Thu Thu Shein","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6803276a61b1c4bb329a5204","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2045825,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hnin Ei Hlaing","original_name":"Hnin Ei Hlaing","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6803277b5570cba9e1ad0964","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2383445,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Myo Min Khin","original_name":"Myo Min Khin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680327882368b12b17993992","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":809,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2haM9foZMukKCNECmcpnKKfchzC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":545}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MM","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
