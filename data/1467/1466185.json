Loui and Jacob, old friends from film school, meet in an anonymous hotel room. What Jacob doesn't know is that Loui has planned the evening as a confrontation: he wants to challenge Jacob with an accusation of a sexual assault he may have committed against their mutual friend, Sofie. As the night unfolds and their versions of the truth collide, the confrontation escalates into a gripping and emotionally charged battle over guilt and responsibility. In the final act, Sofie, the central figure in their conflict, enters the story, adding unexpected perspectives to an already complex narrative. The film, a Danish adaptation of Richard Linklaters's Tape, written by Stephen Belber, balances its heavy themes with subtle humor, challenging the audience to reflect on what defines an assault and who owns the truth.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/jT010QcG3katqKqATe7S351yYXs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":259720,"logo_path":null,"name":"Benjamin Brønnum Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Confession","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2271840,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gustav Scavenius","original_name":"Gustav Scavenius","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/u7wO1e46fDHfUsr1do5sEN1N8yS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Loui","credit_id":"680bcac85cea6daa8c9d1f65","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kasper Ørum","original_name":"Kasper Ørum","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/uSndAAtUEqnl2Wu2cS2EEuw6NBq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jacob","credit_id":"680bcadc63c5f9522989f552","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3169331,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rakel Dimar","original_name":"Rakel Dimar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/kjHmTOzt8nqoWLql0SaXpPIMXD2.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sofie","credit_id":"680bcaffe92f940ca69d63ae","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2189418,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tobias Scavenius","original_name":"Tobias Scavenius","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68013a2caacf7cfb269a3ced","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2189418,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tobias Scavenius","original_name":"Tobias Scavenius","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680bcb246aa1f90c7daac682","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87672,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephen Belber","original_name":"Stephen Belber","popularity":0.0807,"profile_path":"/rZQLg3Rf8GvxGr5wBptFNbNhrox.jpg","credit_id":"680bcb37271ecb3ae08a8f40","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87672,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephen Belber","original_name":"Stephen Belber","popularity":0.0807,"profile_path":"/rZQLg3Rf8GvxGr5wBptFNbNhrox.jpg","credit_id":"680bcb50271ecb3ae08a8f50","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":564,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Linklater","original_name":"Richard Linklater","popularity":0.6824,"profile_path":"/xSctxeZQzQbZoaxIvcDeHlDjbiN.jpg","credit_id":"680bcb65271ecb3ae08a8f78","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2189418,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tobias Scavenius","original_name":"Tobias Scavenius","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680bcb765cea6daa8c9d1fca","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3727,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Sloss","original_name":"John Sloss","popularity":0.172,"profile_path":"/hkawHBjaKfuMER18Qs13mySGvXq.jpg","credit_id":"680bcb8963c5f9522989f560","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2189418,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tobias Scavenius","original_name":"Tobias Scavenius","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680bcb955cea6daa8c9d1fee","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2189418,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tobias Scavenius","original_name":"Tobias Scavenius","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680bcba0271ecb3ae08a8f8a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2674175,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stefan Garfield Rasch Holm","original_name":"Stefan Garfield Rasch Holm","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680bcbb55cea6daa8c9d200e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35992075","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1418,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jT010QcG3katqKqATe7S351yYXs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1006}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
