When Lee atten­ded the 8th Paris Biennale in 1973, the expe­rien­ce dee­ply chan­ged his thin­king, and he began to con­si­der the body as an artis­tic medi­um in itself. He focu­sed on per­for­man­ces rela­ted to spa­ce, situ­a­ti­on, site and the body, giving it the name ​‘event’; dra­wing a line bet­ween ​‘hap­pe­nings’ and his own prac­ti­ce. From 1975 to 1979, Lee pre­sen­ted about 50 ​‘events’ in dif­fe­rent loca­ti­ons and exhi­bi­ti­ons, and alt­hough docu­men­ta­ti­on of Lee’s per­for­man­ces is extre­me­ly rare, Event Logical shows one of the­se events.
