Despite the females' hunting prowess, nine adolescent males dominate every kill. Bigger and stronger, they bully their way to the best spots on the carcass. The pride's two powerful males could easily enforce discipline, but with them away on patrol, the unruly youngsters are running riot. When eight strong lionesses split from the Megapride, food pressure mounts as the remaining females struggle to cater for their sons' growing demands.","popularity":0.1962,"poster_path":"/dLlW4uJ18GZ4iymQ62GOfg3CwdU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7521,"logo_path":"/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png","name":"National Geographic","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2009-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Battle To Survive","title":"Lion Army","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"National Geographic: Wild Lion Army","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Wild Lion Army: Battle To Survive","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1061782,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Billi-Jean Parker","original_name":"Billi-Jean Parker","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/vW7OLWqduacVO6c5J3QJGpDcpSF.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b75c3a36847f8204955","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1039028,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Lamberti","original_name":"Peter Lamberti","popularity":0.0842,"profile_path":"/ciZi1ZYejq504rPLCuGdrf2hN2O.jpg","credit_id":"534d53af0e0a2679eb00012d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2286254,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nathan Pilcher","original_name":"Nathan Pilcher","popularity":0.0737,"profile_path":"/u4hBDqVeLXX7qkQ4bZeuCXgAZXQ.jpg","credit_id":"65ee11ea50733c017c39b37e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2113704","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1237,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dLlW4uJ18GZ4iymQ62GOfg3CwdU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":824}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2043,"name":"lion"},{"id":251493,"name":"big cats"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
