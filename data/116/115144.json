Movie Maker Tom Hovinbøle has from the start in 2001 interviewed a number of artists in the noise genre. The artists relay their thoughts on the phenomenon of noise music - what is it, where does it come from, what is the trade off when replacing traditional harmony and melody for pure audio experience, which possibilities can be explored?  The movie explains the historical context of the genre, from the movement of Futurism and Luigi Russolo from before WWI to electronic experiments in the fifties, avantgarde in the sixties, industry and punk in the seventies to the final establishment of the noise genre at the end of the seventies in Japan. Adding to the flavour are concert performances.","popularity":0.1196,"poster_path":"/64NCRzVUggoduAow9V7EkwPZTea.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2004-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"12 Expressions About Noise Music","title":"Nor Noise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":585931,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Masami Akita","original_name":"Masami Akita","popularity":0.1025,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4b61c3a36847f82010fd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2290398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tore Honoré Bøe","original_name":"Tore Honoré Bøe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5cb70c6d9251414666f3466c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2290401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Cotner","original_name":"David Cotner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5cb70e0692514108cbf581f0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2290414,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lasse Marhaug","original_name":"Lasse Marhaug","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5cb7125192514108cef595f3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1316836,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Toshimaru Nakamura","original_name":"Toshimaru Nakamura","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5cb715309251414666f35220","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2290425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asbjørn Flø","original_name":"Asbjørn Flø","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5cb718110e0a266b9feeff9f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1812979,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Maja Ratkje","original_name":"Maja Ratkje","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/x5wpjUde3sixrfitKguwtIwyuRz.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5cb71a640e0a266b90ef03ee","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2290431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kjell Runar Jenssen","original_name":"Kjell Runar Jenssen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5cb71bc60e0a266b90ef0644","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2290442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helge Sten","original_name":"Helge Sten","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5cb720be0e0a266ba4eef37d","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1316840,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yoshihide Otomo","original_name":"大友良英","popularity":0.2426,"profile_path":"/eUUUsrlRIKvXIaeqBe4S6vZpbxv.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5cb72230c3a3686b0783ad3a","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1066756,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Francisco López","original_name":"Francisco López","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d173d34ca0e17001b6dc947","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1060557,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Hovinbøle","original_name":"Tom Hovinbøle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b61c3a36847f82010f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2290447,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Frank Furseth","original_name":"Frank Furseth","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/lHVIJ5CbmHLkABNinxHjLat6mlt.jpg","credit_id":"5cb724f40e0a266b98ef1275","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5531876","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/64NCRzVUggoduAow9V7EkwPZTea.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
