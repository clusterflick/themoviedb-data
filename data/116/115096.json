One morning, Salvatore is taking in the sunrise over the dunes when he meets a beautiful woman, leading to a romantic interlude between them. It would seem to be an encouraging way to start the day, but Salvatore and his new lover soon happen upon a group of beachcombers who engage them in a conversation about love, philosophy and the future. What began as a beautiful day takes a subtle, unexpected turn and Salvatore begins contemplating the uncertain path of his life and wondering where he could go from here.","popularity":0.1723,"poster_path":"/p39qg0znPtIkStoCneej4wd8KSJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":173758,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ripley's Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2008-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Day in a Life","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1060514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Merone","original_name":"Antonio Merone","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Salvatore","credit_id":"52fe4b60c3a36847f8200c87","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":226381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucia Mascino","original_name":"Lucia Mascino","popularity":0.1428,"profile_path":"/fgtvWOvKi9lCUzCC21XodglaA6C.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Daniela","credit_id":"52fe4b60c3a36847f8200c8b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1060515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco Grifoni","original_name":"Francesco Grifoni","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/4Iu8KUlWZhzBYmmKpdDTviUFnCX.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Cristiano","credit_id":"52fe4b60c3a36847f8200c8f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":223621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chiara Francini","original_name":"Chiara Francini","popularity":0.3394,"profile_path":"/jd3vRXj3w8EdNdaNzVLjxsZr4XZ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Stella","credit_id":"52fe4b60c3a36847f8200c93","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1043921,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiziana Avarista","original_name":"Tiziana Avarista","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Eva","credit_id":"6115e7e435c30a0045bd51d1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3031919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Grossi","original_name":"Mario Grossi","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/gBxlwz0G1hz7ZjhVXQsKq3METme.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Pino","credit_id":"6115e7f5b686b9002c84e490","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3854739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco Zecca","original_name":"Francesco Zecca","popularity":0.1171,"profile_path":"/aygzy6ozLZ11InMBP1UNDg8qJU6.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Massimiliano","credit_id":"67d9b0627e8778bd1c17dafa","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5312799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco D'Aiello","original_name":"Francesco D'Aiello","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Boy","credit_id":"67d9b07b41d983133217dd7e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5312801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saschat","original_name":"Saschat","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Raffaele","credit_id":"67d9b0cd8d312c5569bb4e3f","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1060513,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stefano Tummolini","original_name":"Stefano Tummolini","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/r1xEtOwRfWyP1OSsu0eLdv51ote.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b60c3a36847f8200c83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1327908","wikidata_id":"Q4003636","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.776,"height":811,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5LTD8NShKDt2tDY6Ru15VFVeWzN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440},{"aspect_ratio":1.776,"height":811,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yygNdNpqrmHsVSWtJHYfJZwsiSt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1029,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p39qg0znPtIkStoCneej4wd8KSJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":258533,"name":"gay theme"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
