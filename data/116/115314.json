It is a compelling history of the devastating early days of the epidemic in NYC, when men with \"GRID\" were a stigmatized population that died swiftly of a terrifying new disease. Few concepts have had as great an impact on sexuality over the past 28 years as that of \"safer sex.\" Yet, as a concept, it is important to remember two things: first, safer sex had to be invented amidst an alarming lack of information that existed before the discovery of HIV in 1984; and second, safer sex as a concept had to be sold by the persistent and creative persuasion of community based groups all across the country.","popularity":0.0784,"poster_path":"/qcu9AEUTKrxdgmLZp5IRjinf64L.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sex in an Epidemic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1060862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Shernoff","original_name":"Michael Shernoff","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"himself","credit_id":"52fe4b67c3a36847f8202109","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1060864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenyon Farrow","original_name":"Kenyon Farrow","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"himself","credit_id":"52fe4b67c3a36847f820210d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1060865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cynthia Gomez","original_name":"Cynthia Gomez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"herself","credit_id":"52fe4b67c3a36847f8202111","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1060867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maxine Wolfe","original_name":"Maxine Wolfe","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"herself","credit_id":"52fe4b67c3a36847f8202115","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1060868,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anne-Christine d'Adesky","original_name":"Anne-Christine d'Adesky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"herself","credit_id":"52fe4b67c3a36847f8202119","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":973370,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Carlomusto","original_name":"Jean Carlomusto","popularity":0.0839,"profile_path":"/iRJEV67gXkaCzPVbJxKHaX2Zznl.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b67c3a36847f8202105","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6740406","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qcu9AEUTKrxdgmLZp5IRjinf64L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"SEX IN AN EPIDEMIC trailer","key":"NBALp4x28lo","published_at":"2010-05-20T14:40:40.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6e5c3a3685448008a63"}]}}}
