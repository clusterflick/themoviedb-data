After nearly destroying a farmer's (Richard Fiske) pile of firewood, the boys come to the assistance of the Widow Jenkins (Eva McKenzie), who has just been cheated out of her land by a trio of swindlers (Dick Curtis, Eddie Laughton, James Craig). Attempting to fix the woman's well, the Stooges instead unleash an oil geyser. They manage to retrieve the deed to the land and are allowed to marry the now wealthy Widow Jenkins' daughters. Moe tells Curly to wish for quintuplets, and Curly replies, \"We'll honeymoon in Canada!\" (a reference to the Dionne quintuplets).","popularity":0.3789,"poster_path":"/avZBQEDqehnas8C6kUl7RzEgyzj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1939-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oily to Bed, Oily to Rise","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89614,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Curly Howard","original_name":"Curly Howard","popularity":0.2883,"profile_path":"/ozWdyoTNqWy55bOglIFqR4ZalwZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Curly","credit_id":"52fe4b7fc3a36847f8206973","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moe Howard","original_name":"Moe Howard","popularity":0.6107,"profile_path":"/93l6M2P42vracu6cfzuOqmYBYk1.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Moe","credit_id":"58a87ad8c3a36845a90002b4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Fine","original_name":"Larry Fine","popularity":0.3206,"profile_path":"/zdT16UWESRhhT48KGeXibmQzslQ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Larry","credit_id":"58a87adec3a36845cb000281","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":153638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Curtis","original_name":"Dick Curtis","popularity":0.3143,"profile_path":"/yLb6fRcbl1T58a0H7htYBQWlJI3.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Clipper -
