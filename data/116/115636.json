Filmed appropriately at Lake House, Sting's 16-century manor house in Wiltshire, and in the ancient gardens of Il Palagio, his home in Italy, the DVD also features the performers before a live audience at St. Luke's Church in London. Interspersed between performances of such timeless Dowland songs such as \"Can She Excuse My Wrongs,\" \"Come Again,\" and \"Flow My Tears,\" are discussions with musicologists David Pinto and Anthony Rooley of the composer's place in music history and his relevance today, plus recitations by Sting from Dowland's personal correspondence.","popularity":0.2643,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Journey And The Labyrinth: The Music Of John Dowland","title":"STING: The Journey & The Labyrinth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sting","original_name":"Sting","popularity":0.7867,"profile_path":"/y6gpCAf6LTHcqFXEZ2udXJkucAm.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ba15c8c925141167b003f98","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/goq5IAIrx4b3466QLhBdh8rHVeM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
