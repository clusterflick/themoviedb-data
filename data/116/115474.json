With his wife Nadia (Elena Stejko) in tow he sets sail from Russia in a tiny lifeboat, drifting cross the Pacific to finally arrive in New Zealand. Before long Misha realises that New Zealand is no more receptive to his ideas and aesthetic than Russia. Yet he perseveres with his experimental film, ignoring his wife’s pleas to find work. Misha increasingly withdraws into himself, and his relationship with Nadia collapses. Alone, his obsessions take hold and he steadily descends into madness. Only a chance encounter with a young Polynesian woman saves him from the ultimate act of self-destruction. His friendship with Roseanna (Stephanie Tauevihi) inspires a re-awakening, as he begins to reconnect with the world around him.","popularity":0.488,"poster_path":"/i495UGLaZA5qoG8ESpNBeG2A7Ie.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27550,"logo_path":null,"name":"Godzone Pictures Ltd","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"2010-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When you're making the film of your life, it's easy to lose the plot!","title":"Russian Snark","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Papps","original_name":"Stephen Papps","popularity":0.2252,"profile_path":"/gPVthH8eQPprIR5NdU8uScdCEhk.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Misha","credit_id":"53c4a425c3a368246b000e22","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1341670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elena Stejko","original_name":"Elena Stejko","popularity":0.0738,"profile_path":"/ehJ5KfnEHIK51ypEcxHsPr4cB6e.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Nadia","credit_id":"53c4a441c3a368246e000e57","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1236978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephanie Tauevihi","original_name":"Stephanie Tauevihi","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":"/m1UDQJ12xWtzNeajHqBu0c2bj4h.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Roseanna","credit_id":"53c4a464c3a368248f000e22","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rene Naufahu","original_name":"Rene Naufahu","popularity":0.2023,"profile_path":"/9YFXNZYTebxcp9lhNAP7SfpdClY.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Vincent","credit_id":"53c4fbf9c3a368249400127a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1235539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Rowley","original_name":"Peter Rowley","popularity":0.2237,"profile_path":"/asVFuTsigtObUMVAPZk56b1mfC.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Neville","credit_id":"53c4fc33c3a368248f0012c3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Johnson","original_name":"Greg Johnson","popularity":0.1814,"profile_path":"/rGrj5sqHkkTr2EBYPF5f3XBJTub.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Chicken Farmer","credit_id":"53c4fc84c3a36824790012af","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1300289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glen-Paul Waru","original_name":"Glen-Paul Waru","popularity":0.065,"profile_path":"/4Atfedx0WWlwsjppgr2S7UBd5Lq.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Young Man 1","credit_id":"5eae127b0c3ec8001dcc50af","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11325,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephen Sinclair","original_name":"Stephen Sinclair","popularity":0.1233,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53c4a508c3a368247c000ddd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1339875,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Liz DiFiore","original_name":"Liz DiFiore","popularity":0.0448,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53c4f91f0e0a261e03001537","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11325,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephen Sinclair","original_name":"Stephen Sinclair","popularity":0.1233,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53c4fb8cc3a368249400126f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1340119","wikidata_id":"Q3942919","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i495UGLaZA5qoG8ESpNBeG2A7Ie.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"M","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Russian Snark The Movie Trailer - HD","key":"s1GCd5IrpSY","published_at":"2011-05-30T03:39:13.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"53c4a855c3a3682476000ef7"}]}}}
