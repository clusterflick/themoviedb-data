Nevertheless, his assistant, Amador, informs him that he gave some of the mice to an old trapper, nicknamed “el Muecas”, who lives in precarious conditions in a shanty town outside Madrid, and that this poor man has successfully bred them with the help of the natural heat of his daughters. The incredulous scientist goes to the shanty town to obtain the mice. There, Pedro meets Muecas, Muecas's wife Ricarda and their two daughters Florita and Conchi. With the warmth of the women’s breasts, as the flirtatious Florita shows Pedro, the mice are able to reproduce.","popularity":0.4005,"poster_path":"/66gWTnOyoVk5X4KszuCC8ScAcYe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1986-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tiempo de silencio","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Imanol Arias","original_name":"Imanol Arias","popularity":0.3272,"profile_path":"/lbBiRaDzDzojfs6VbMfgzsf6QnI.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Pedro Martín","credit_id":"52fe4b76c3a36847f8204d13","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":25256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victoria Abril","original_name":"Victoria Abril","popularity":0.9555,"profile_path":"/eXI42Fp7MIGHxEzmAX20I94CZi6.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dorita","credit_id":"52fe4b76c3a36847f8204d17","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":258049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charo López","original_name":"Charo López","popularity":0.3102,"profile_path":"/g4NOfEwhBlcj3qGEDNe0IPR6RGD.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Charo","credit_id":"52fe4b76c3a36847f8204d1b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francisco Rabal","original_name":"Francisco Rabal","popularity":0.7356,"profile_path":"/4SXneju54P5QjrF7ZmAlU09HHxX.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Muecas","credit_id":"52fe4b76c3a36847f8204d1f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1061900,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joaquín Hinojosa","original_name":"Joaquín Hinojosa","popularity":0.143,"profile_path":"/mL2XDG2c3hXyJUmmlE03OoKreMY.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Cartucho","credit_id":"52fe4b76c3a36847f8204d23","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan Echanove","original_name":"Juan Echanove","popularity":0.1881,"profile_path":"/vxmDaQTD6mRFRwXMEtXqovoaPXj.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Matías","credit_id":"52fe4b76c3a36847f8204d27","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vicente Aranda","original_name":"Vicente Aranda","popularity":0.2573,"profile_path":"/9w6rHSUW4cW49qEzNVtA4i2bEUy.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b76c3a36847f8204d03","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1061867,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Antonio Rabinad","original_name":"Antonio Rabinad","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b76c3a36847f8204d09","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1061898,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Luis Martín Santos","original_name":"Luis Martín Santos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b76c3a36847f8204d0f","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vicente Aranda","original_name":"Vicente Aranda","popularity":0.2573,"profile_path":"/9w6rHSUW4cW49qEzNVtA4i2bEUy.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b76c3a36847f8204cfd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0092093","wikidata_id":"Q7801018","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3U3oiDnw4Qdvpaf9mGIsyEiAy9d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":846,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/flhBSN6QlzHu6ihthSzQw4jbeyw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1504},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1032,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3QkwtVIMtrBEQNrhzaYbP4c6u1L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1835},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":2159,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xlEThFOwyLUGqbnLh3m7GE9BmEq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gHypvsvRIM7M0tLlhy0iJJfN9k2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1918}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/66gWTnOyoVk5X4KszuCC8ScAcYe.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
