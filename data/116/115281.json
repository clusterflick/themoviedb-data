When we know how these habits are created we can set about not only breaking these patterns, but also re-program (rewire) our brain so that new and positive habits can take over and benefit us in our daily life. Dr. Dispenza has spent decades studying the human mind-how it works, how it stores information and why it perpetuates the same behavioral patterns over and over. Over the last 10 years, Dr. Dispenza has lectured in over 17 different countries on six continents educating people about the role and function of the human brain. He has taught thousands of people how to re-program their thinking through scientifically proven neuro-physiologic principles.","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":"/dpqjPh01VepaDtz5HatYBeYP1Xw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Evolve Your Brain: The Science of Changing Your Mind","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Evolve Your Brain - The Science of Changing Your Mind","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dpqjPh01VepaDtz5HatYBeYP1Xw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
