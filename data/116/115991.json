On the run, they are hired by a millionaire to pose as children. It seems the man's wife wants to adopt some refugees to impress her society friends. Moe is Johnny, Curly is Frankie and Larry is Mabel. Everything goes fairly well as the lady shows off the stooges to her friends, but they finally irritate her husband so much that he goes after them with an ax.","popularity":0.6423,"poster_path":"/64DItgMHTMBLYTzHbyxsRRxuxiY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1941-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All the World's a Stooge","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89614,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Curly Howard","original_name":"Curly Howard","popularity":0.2883,"profile_path":"/ozWdyoTNqWy55bOglIFqR4ZalwZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Curly","credit_id":"52fe4b81c3a36847f8206deb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moe Howard","original_name":"Moe Howard","popularity":0.6107,"profile_path":"/93l6M2P42vracu6cfzuOqmYBYk1.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Moe","credit_id":"58a87db3c3a3684584000466","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Fine","original_name":"Larry Fine","popularity":0.3206,"profile_path":"/zdT16UWESRhhT48KGeXibmQzslQ.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Larry","credit_id":"58a87db99251416f7f00047d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":120735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lelah Tyler","original_name":"Lelah Tyler","popularity":0.0705,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Lotta Bullion","credit_id":"52fe4b81c3a36847f8206def","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emory Parnell","original_name":"Emory Parnell","popularity":0.3292,"profile_path":"/eI6HoBY4IK8NP1k9gJKicLhIekv.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ajax Bullion","credit_id":"52fe4b81c3a36847f8206df3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1287806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Poppy Wilde","original_name":"Poppy Wilde","popularity":0.1234,"profile_path":"/rhMQrOF96yqeHSRjpsm98xxqlnf.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Party Guest (uncredited)","credit_id":"5cf0ffc992514141f2b8dd3e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32192,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olaf Hytten","original_name":"Olaf Hytten","popularity":0.1539,"profile_path":"/A47xM0KsIYVS0wMHNKdME8DyOwr.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Botters - Butler (uncredited)","credit_id":"647574f5c2823a014870c11f","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Del Lord","original_name":"Del Lord","popularity":0.2773,"profile_path":"/zGGlVrOKtnNXn9yxKMYkGY1yBMg.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b81c3a36847f8206df9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143563,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Grey","original_name":"John Grey","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b81c3a36847f8206dff","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Del Lord","original_name":"Del Lord","popularity":0.2773,"profile_path":"/zGGlVrOKtnNXn9yxKMYkGY1yBMg.jpg","credit_id":"64e50e401feac100c46c6fae","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1062834,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hugh McCollum","original_name":"Hugh McCollum","popularity":0.0695,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e50e2ad236e6013b31280f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":417176,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Art Seid","original_name":"Art Seid","popularity":0.129,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e50fd5e0ca7f011ddbc645","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96726,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Benjamin H.
