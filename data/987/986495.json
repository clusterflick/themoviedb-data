Portraits of bands playing in doomed houses, and the ritual of demolition set to music. These films always had in them a giant underlined subtext of temporality. This newest release, the Atlanta edition, is different in one major way. It is now being released almost a full decade after being filmed. The implied time capsule of the earlier films becomes explicit in this one, allowing us to view well known bands like Mastadon, Deerhunter, The Black Lips, and the Coathangers, in their infancy. Like finding an undeveloped roll of baby pictures, Burn to Shine 6: Atlanta takes us to a place that we forgot even existed.","popularity":0.1084,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":39210,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trixie Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Burn to Shine - Vol. 6: Atlanta, GA 07.29.2007","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":74331,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christoph Green","original_name":"Christoph Green","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a41cc7caaca2005079b64e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":74330,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brendan Canty","original_name":"Brendan Canty","popularity":0.0772,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a41cd77e12f02ff6583060","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3583959,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lee Tesche","original_name":"Lee Tesche","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a41d2ac8f858500b82dfa6","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
