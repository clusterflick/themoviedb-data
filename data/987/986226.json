Zaira, a girl of African origins, aspires to the role of the Marquis, but the teacher finds it more logical to assign her to a white girl. The two little friends will find a way to stage the true meaning of the poem, demonstrating that differences are overcome with a simple change of perspective.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"'A Livella De' Creature","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3583081,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angelo Borruto","original_name":"Angelo Borruto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a30dc2bccf1e0050fa5735","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3250845,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Pierfrancesco Borruto","original_name":"Pierfrancesco Borruto","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a30dd135d1bc5106b71921","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
