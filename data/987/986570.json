But within a few short days, nearly 10,000 of these proud warriors would be laying dead on Flodden Field. Among the hacked corpses would be the body of King James himself. This is the story of the most catastrophic military defeat in Scotland's history. For a turquoise ring and a foolish promise, James IV had risked, and lost, everything. This video includes dramatic and authentic battle re-enactments and the very latest in computer graphics to help tell this chapter in the bloody story of the conflicts between England and Scotland.","popularity":0.6763,"poster_path":"/yfzOKCNYTatQMFwzScVq46tYaPS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Battle of Flodden","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1225732,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terry Molloy","original_name":"Terry Molloy","popularity":0.2819,"profile_path":"/9z7NwtIyAidbPc9r0VN2QLXZKR7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"62a476ad85005d2b16cf8275","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3584207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Kingsley","original_name":"John Kingsley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Northumbrian Soldier","credit_id":"62a476c505b5494d6d297ac5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1647555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Rotherham","original_name":"Tony Rotherham","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"King James IV","credit_id":"62a476db00bfe802540b0d7e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3584212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lionel M Digby","original_name":"Lionel M Digby","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Howard, Earl of Surrey","credit_id":"62a476f6e38bd814d306074c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3584214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liz Moretti","original_name":"Liz Moretti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Queen Marguerite","credit_id":"62a4770c35d1bc5107cb9316","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2753668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Leighton","original_name":"Michael Leighton","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Pitscottie","credit_id":"62a477246c8492180709b744","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3546225,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sean Willis","original_name":"Sean Willis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a4778ae38bd814d306082f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229579,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bob Carruthers","original_name":"Bob Carruthers","popularity":0.1612,"profile_path":"/vWqpErkseOgbYYiKoc0VvmEvHDX.jpg","credit_id":"62a477b285005d2b1856ba8a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2753682,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Owen Parker","original_name":"Owen Parker","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a4776985005d2b16cf8337","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":231540,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Terry Shand","original_name":"Terry Shand","popularity":0.056,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a4779ee38bd814d4651485","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305097,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeremy Freeston","original_name":"Jeremy Freeston","popularity":0.0758,"profile_path":"/1W5Rjwy7DHt1vmBMi7NlOuI7KGV.jpg","credit_id":"62a477cb7e12f02ff658ee7b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305097,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeremy Freeston","original_name":"Jeremy Freeston","popularity":0.0758,"profile_path":"/1W5Rjwy7DHt1vmBMi7NlOuI7KGV.jpg","credit_id":"62a477c07e12f02ff658ee6f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":844,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wpOxoVBBjPNV6UzgaJjD6L4DUJW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yfzOKCNYTatQMFwzScVq46tYaPS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
