The BTCC is tin top racing at its very best, and the '07 season witnessed the closest door handle-to-door handle battles yet! In fact, the racing was so close many of the adrenalin-fuelled battles went to the chequered flag, and plenty of the stars ended their bids for glory in the gravel traps and tyre barriers. The Official season review brings you all the bumper-to-bumper racing, controversy and massive smashes from a truly gripping year of racing. Follow the ferocious championship battle between SEAT's Jason Plato and Vauxhall's Fabrizio Giovanardi to its dramatic climax - the pair separated by a single point with just one race left.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":424,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BTCC 2007 Review","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
