When she falls for Brad, a doctor at her clinic, and gets entangled in a steamy love affair, Melanie does the unthinkable. After drugging and murdering Bill, she dismembers him and places the body parts into three suitcases, throwing them into Chesapeake Bay. But when the suitcases are found on the shores of Virginia Beach, an investigation is launched leading to Melanie as the prime suspect. Led by the efforts of assistant attorney general Patti Prezioso, authorities eventually bring Melanie to justice, who despite being convicted, continues to maintain her innocence.","popularity":0.9694,"poster_path":"/bk9rCfidmjoe4uLHAsUWGjD8urZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6728,"logo_path":"/2HMc1LNp5BoVSJtM2vHh5UuLXfw.png","name":"Swirl Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Suitcase Killer: The Melanie McGuire Story","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":21,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":85144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Candice King","original_name":"Candice King","popularity":1.5157,"profile_path":"/qy290E0X2o1NZwhGyiGSmMi1tyB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Melanie McGuire","credit_id":"62a625f5a8b2ca00a4242606","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1447863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Roark","original_name":"Michael Roark","popularity":0.4745,"profile_path":"/9J2tP7yKXCPmAIfDC1Dpw1Ll66q.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bill McGuire","credit_id":"62a6260853866e0de1cd7681","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackson Hurst","original_name":"Jackson Hurst","popularity":0.4206,"profile_path":"/aizQOKQVc4mD9pyssS5eCf2vuiO.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Brad","credit_id":"62a62620875d1a009f836ec3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":61980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wendie Malick","original_name":"Wendie Malick","popularity":1.4932,"profile_path":"/4yDh5iu4Qyib35aXfo7SStFpnNC.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Patti Prezioso","credit_id":"62a62636d5569718c88bcc5e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2761025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tristan Laurence Perez","original_name":"Tristan Laurence Perez","popularity":0.0699,"profile_path":"/4DdX5gKi6c97II2kJPSK1ueacW6.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Joe Tacopina","credit_id":"63b4da7e9715ae0082d5c53a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4685375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Brown","original_name":"Kevin Brown","popularity":0.0635,"profile_path":"/luXZd6KQc4YGJ9626OYczdjwlme.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Bailiff","credit_id":"663154a0a843c10123a76b7b","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3585923,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicole L.
