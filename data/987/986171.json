An outgrowth of our earlier production, PICTURE START, this 95-minute documentary tracks the rise of Marian Penner Bancroft, Christos Dikeakos, Rodney Graham, Jeff Wall and Ian Wallace from the rich countercultural milieu of 1960s Vancouver, to their place of global prominence today. Drawing back the curtain on this extraordinary set of artists, IS THERE A PICTURE offers rare insight into their work, their relationships with one another, and how it is they emerged in a city until recently known more for its surrounding forests than its art.","popularity":0.0448,"poster_path":"/1BXFKkWGcEb2rJv4fvA8Nl6ppWW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":176869,"logo_path":null,"name":"Laughing Mountain Communications","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Is There a Picture","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2141262,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rafi Spivak","original_name":"Rafi Spivak","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a2c70fdc1cb42f0eebf195","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3582904,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ric Beairsto","original_name":"Ric Beairsto","popularity":0.1151,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a2c6c07d5db502f81c3a43","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2155210,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Harry Killas","original_name":"Harry Killas","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a11f0321621b012c595b87","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8151448","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.662,"height":1223,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1BXFKkWGcEb2rJv4fvA8Nl6ppWW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":810}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
