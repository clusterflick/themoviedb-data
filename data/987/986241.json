However, with the exception of switching to a relatively realistic screen for the recollections that accompany the dialogue, almost the entire film takes place in a space within or around a single tatami room, as in a rehearsal (reading) of a play. The clothing is an exaggerated representation of the character attributes of the original story. Sakiyo's mask is a headgear that is an exact copy of the head of the actor who plays him, and is simply made unusually large so that it is recognisable as a mask.","popularity":0.2323,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2020-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"犬神家の一族","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sosuke Ikematsu","original_name":"池松壮亮","popularity":0.7639,"profile_path":"/mNhgUAKfHdKQXhbhbAhKcRUHy30.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"62a3121f7e12f02ff813e4cd","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":818,"name":"based on novel or book"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
