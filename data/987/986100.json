Partially inspired by Freud's \"The Uncanny\" and the exploration of the etymology of the words ‘heimlich’ and ‘unheimlich’ or ‘homely’ and ‘unhomely,’ as it directly translates into English. This film looks into a familiar haunted house or, rather, a constructed environment haunted by its creator's ability to remain omnipresent. Designed with dubious goals, this room, or startup screen, is constructed to welcome you to The New Frontier of the digital era.","popularity":0.0411,"poster_path":"/bB89dBkZEQ8HOFAXOADcsvLOge.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Welcome Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2025477,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leonardo Pirondi","original_name":"Leonardo Pirondi","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/pyv8eYEGsWE4D2tSmrTIyt0mNcW.jpg","credit_id":"62a27dc7d2147c117daebb4b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bB89dBkZEQ8HOFAXOADcsvLOge.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/urEuGDwmwz8mnxnu4nBkCe5XIyM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Chicago Underground Film Festival","release_date":"2023-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
