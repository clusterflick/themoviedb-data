But to get out, he must first win a game with specific rules: first, he writes a number, from 1 to 6, and sends it in a message. Once he has received the answer, he proceeds to the next step: he rolls the dice. However, the dice number does not correspond to the message number. Punishment: instead of opening the front door, all the interior doors close. Trapped in the hallways of the house and separated from his locked dog in one of the rooms, P. now has to wait 24 hours to roll the dice again in order to get out or, most likely, face a new, more painful test. As time goes on, hallucinations, buried memories and dreams become entangled with reality and P. gradually reaches his limits. Filmed during the pandemic, \"ENA\" is a -not so much- dystopian thriller with comic elements that explores the marginal and paradoxical condition of home confinement, but also the forgotten mystery of everyday spaces.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/vownZF5LLpJTy0rJHjCOTnWnqhp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178474,"logo_path":"/AvEu3FUJOiul65MTD74MQmQckQi.png","name":"Film School of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2021-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2695876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anastasis Laoulakos","original_name":"Αναστάσης Λαουλάκος","popularity":0.0845,"profile_path":"/55byM4gyu0ZeGVksSjYXTeGkzr1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Π","credit_id":"62a7431c3d4d9617e7a9de45","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3586895,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Giannis Markopoulos","original_name":"Giannis Markopoulos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a743b3d5569718c88fd9f2","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3586893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mihail Laoulakos","original_name":"Mihail Laoulakos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a7435265e0a20066da41e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3586893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mihail Laoulakos","original_name":"Mihail Laoulakos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a743fbeb14fa09dca12ce9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3586893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mihail Laoulakos","original_name":"Mihail Laoulakos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a743c9eb14fa09ddb6e86a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3586893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mihail Laoulakos","original_name":"Mihail Laoulakos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a743dd7e12f00e28312cd6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3586893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mihail Laoulakos","original_name":"Mihail Laoulakos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a7437d65e0a20066da4240","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3586893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mihail Laoulakos","original_name":"Mihail Laoulakos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62af817d88b14800935ca4f5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3586893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mihail Laoulakos","original_name":"Mihail Laoulakos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6342ba391b7c5900791885e3","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3586893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mihail Laoulakos","original_name":"Mihail Laoulakos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63585695308131007c2d6aa4","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3586893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mihail Laoulakos","original_name":"Mihail Laoulakos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635856a4a13533007c45ec11","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"450646075674026","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":756,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vownZF5LLpJTy0rJHjCOTnWnqhp.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":506},{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":966,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3fvugIpdavTpWuWStsksyr60spR.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":646}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"5th Panorama","release_date":"2021-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"5th Panorama","release_date":"2021-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
