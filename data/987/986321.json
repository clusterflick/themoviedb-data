There were a record-breaking seven different winners in the first seven races, the closest-ever race finish, the debut of Grand Prix winner Johnny Herbert and just eight points splitting the top three in the championship-deciding final race - plus plenty of edge-of-the-seat action. Relive the BTCC drama in more than seven hours of highlights as we follow the nail-biting title battle right down to the final lap - with exceptional action footage, interviews with the stars and commentary from Ben Edwards and Tim Harvey bringing you the full story from all 10 rounds. We have extracted the very best action from all 30 races to not only deliver the complete story of the knife-edge championship battle, but to bring you more than seven hours of the very finest bumper-to-bumper, wing mirror-smashing, panel-denting racing.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":433,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BTCC 2009 Review","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
