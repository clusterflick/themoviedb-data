Using forest management, the Ashaninka Indians turn degraded land into a place for communal cultivation. Banana trees are grown for food and also as fertilizer for other crops, including plants that are used for building materials. The video also shows how the Ashaninka are able to attract more wild game with the fruit that they grow, as well as keeping honeybees and turtles for food. By conducting studies of plants and animals they are continually finding ways to improve their system. Through communal, sustainable cultivation of the forest, these Indians protect their land and plan to feed themselves well into the future.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/7lL8dm6vETIqZ72ns8e1RVJFcut.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Living Forest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3583665,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benki Pianko","original_name":"Benki Pianko","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a3c8c6e38bd8005158c918","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7lL8dm6vETIqZ72ns8e1RVJFcut.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
