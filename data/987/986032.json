Mondello Park provided a dream start for defending champion James Thompson with a win in both rounds. Title contenders soon emerged from Thompson’s dust and an enthralling battle prevailed. Whilst Paul O’Neill was scrapping it out for third place with Matt Neal and Anthony Reid, last season’s top two, Thompson and Yvan Muller, had scores to settle out in front. As Vauxhall appeared in a strong position for a one-two-three finish there was everything to fight for, and they did! The skills of Thompson and Muller shone through yet again as a season of intense bumper-to-bumper action drew to a close and the two ensured another mouth-watering finish to the BTCC season.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":233,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BTCC 2003 Review","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
