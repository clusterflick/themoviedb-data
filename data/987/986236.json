Yashiro Ryusuke's own home is located on Y Koji. When he first accompanies Kanako on the road, Kagawa meets her in front of Yashiro's house, and Kamei also appears there.  Dr Asano's wife did not show up.  It is explained that Kagawa has two girls (in the original story, one is a student at a girls' school, but the gender of the other is unknown).  The introduction of the 'one in 500 murderers' is told against the backdrop of Kindaichi excavating an air-raid shelter (which appears to have been made from a natural cave).","popularity":0.5759,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15505,"logo_path":"/3MuBcEqLa5QRkZTpXBLzyk9zOmO.png","name":"NHK","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2016-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Satsujinki","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sosuke Ikematsu","original_name":"池松壮亮","popularity":0.7639,"profile_path":"/mNhgUAKfHdKQXhbhbAhKcRUHy30.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"62a3103285005d00acba5da3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1080183,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daigo Matsui","original_name":"松居大悟","popularity":0.186,"profile_path":"/guo6jGYA1AkSgZDRXh5SbzmAQzm.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64a779bc957e6d00e210caab","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1179243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rila Fukushima","original_name":"福島リラ","popularity":0.774,"profile_path":"/raklPPc6AZcDnNrjmJu60FHxI2F.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64a779e065c26c00aedd095f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":551835,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takuya Muramatsu","original_name":"Takuya Muramatsu","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64a77a27af2da8014e558e0a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2430931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nagano","original_name":"永野","popularity":0.0356,"profile_path":"/n4kjbmNpF7CjDed5lHaIWnniFWi.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64a77a7465c26c014edc89a1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1234090,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shimako Iwai","original_name":"岩井志麻子","popularity":0.1181,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64a77a8ef9253200aee354f9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79458,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoshiyuki Morishita","original_name":"森下能幸","popularity":0.5867,"profile_path":"/yG5wnn8UrvZ1qelNpit6Lnba0xC.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"64a77aa365c26c012df9c607","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sakichi Sato","original_name":"佐藤佐吉","popularity":0.3897,"profile_path":"/1runpc2mcguDPdn7LTm2n06KISZ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"64a77ab0af2da800ae64519c","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sakichi Sato","original_name":"佐藤佐吉","popularity":0.3897,"profile_path":"/1runpc2mcguDPdn7LTm2n06KISZ.jpg","credit_id":"64a77ac896522000c60428c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
