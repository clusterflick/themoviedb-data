She moves in with him and his family, which includes his brother, Niranjan (Ramesh Deo), his sister-in-law, Jaswanti (Shashikala), their three children, and Deepak's father (Jagirdar). That leaves the humiliated Prakash determined to get Aarti back, whatever he may have to do. He manages to bring a discord in their marital life, so much so that Deepak asks Aarti to leave, and she returns home to her father.
