A West German scientist has discovered a way to recover missiles shot into space, and the major Western powers are after his secret. Even though the scientist is willing to pass his discovery on to NATO, it is guarded by an elite, undercover West German police force. As foreign agents, including the Russians and Americans, try to get their hands on the secret, \"The Gorilla\" is forced into the affair by his surly, aging boss -- he has to make sure that the scientist's discovery ends up with NATO.","popularity":0.3273,"poster_path":"/cZ7I6jCmQJhilLS5AZQQSPbvNBz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9055,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Raoul
