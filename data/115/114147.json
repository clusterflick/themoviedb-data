This lineup had an exceptional rhythm section , who help give the songs a lift and they make me want to watch and listen again and again .  One gets a good idea of how mellow Roxy could be as the ballads are convincingly done , with stirring lead work by Neil Hubbard on MY ONLY LOVE being the highpoint of a standout version .  A good release - maybe one day they will be able to clean up the picture . I'm very happy with the music , however .  Worth a spin for those fans of this influential band .","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/p7Fh0zqjJ8wAJVywsik5LnH5BqQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roxy Music - The High Road","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p7Fh0zqjJ8wAJVywsik5LnH5BqQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":525}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
