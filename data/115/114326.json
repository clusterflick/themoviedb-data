He has only one flaw: an unusually long nose which makes him unattractive to any woman. Thus, he cannot have the woman he loves, his cousin Roxanne. Roxanne loves an officer in his army who gets tongue-tied in front of women. Who will Roxanne love? Will Cyrano ever find love? Or will he find happiness in helping the officer woo Roxanne? This is a story of split personalities, human frailty and unrequited love.","popularity":0.3023,"poster_path":"/8KpNO8fXmw7WNBFPqhftoTn8q2S.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":41913,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unione Cinematografica
