Seen through the viewpoint of devoted principal Deanna Burney, the film shows Stanton as grossly underfunded, understaffed, and filled with children struggling to overcome their difficulties. But for these at-risk kids, however, the hope for their future survives only in the success of their education. A captivating series of vignettes concerning children growing up outside the American dream, echoing current “hot-button” issues in our country’s ongoing political discussion.","popularity":0.1739,"poster_path":"/fjQyXCYYGIdaBn5bEGxHjpSD8P1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am a Promise: The Children of Stanton Elementary School","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1059122,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susan Raymond","original_name":"Susan Raymond","popularity":0.0995,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"56faa7899251411c270001ad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1598129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deanna Burney","original_name":"Deanna Burney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"56faa7899251410d8f0003fa","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1076768,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Raymond","original_name":"Alan Raymond","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b4dc3a36847f81fd1b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1059122,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susan Raymond","original_name":"Susan Raymond","popularity":0.0995,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b4dc3a36847f81fd1ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0107177","wikidata_id":"Q1655139","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1054,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gAQYTAN2cT3VL5zmcMVhUKWTS3s.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1873},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vR8V2yWsu21ilKh9cRr5yoSTLMO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1763,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fjQyXCYYGIdaBn5bEGxHjpSD8P1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1175},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2097,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pgF4DSwrJ0AFzI3pRBlaFuETTYN.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1398}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDb","release_date":"1993-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
