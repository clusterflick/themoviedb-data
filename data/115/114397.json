The film illustrates the school's emphasis on the “Habits of Mind” program (weighing evidence; awareness of multiple points of view; seeing connections and relationships; speculating on possibilities; and assessing values.) Sequences illustrating the school's approach to learning include: classroom activities in the humanities and sciences; family conferences; discussions of race, class, and gender; faculty meetings; disciplinary problems; sex education; conflict resolution by students; and student council meetings.","popularity":0.2252,"poster_path":"/gWoiDmalVqR25oX1kmYkqQnMAd1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62355,"logo_path":"/bDgvYQdKAZSnJvewHL8KSzie5Km.png","name":"Zipporah Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":220,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"High School II","video":false,"vote_average":6.278,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138006,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frederick Wiseman","original_name":"Frederick Wiseman","popularity":0.148,"profile_path":"/zFuaJUt4ZUriko9iERruOnPUoJF.jpg","credit_id":"5f1bce0d0e597b003334b5fe","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138006,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frederick Wiseman","original_name":"Frederick Wiseman","popularity":0.148,"profile_path":"/zFuaJUt4ZUriko9iERruOnPUoJF.jpg","credit_id":"5f1bcde5735205003e44bb64","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17277,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lodge Kerrigan","original_name":"Lodge Kerrigan","popularity":0.1994,"profile_path":"/toHvjUTdnQkCFoEcdDlfnv7jUFv.jpg","credit_id":"5f1bce5c223a8b0035ebe1df","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1206943,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Davey","original_name":"John Davey","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/sMVAde2oDpRiRKLBWfgmvnmhtHN.jpg","credit_id":"5f1bcdfa0e597b003434730e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2721870,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Victoria Garvin Davis","original_name":"Victoria Garvin Davis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1bce76af58cb0037433e07","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2721881,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Marian Parry","original_name":"Marian Parry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9fe69d7614210036f3d2a9","department":"Art","job":"Title Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2840539,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carolyn Kaylor","original_name":"Carolyn Kaylor","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9fe68c160e73003844a229","department":"Sound","job":"Assistant Sound Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0110025","wikidata_id":"Q3135420","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":722,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/h8ZJAZwiEy051LYNzfCOdOzGQBi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1285}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gWoiDmalVqR25oX1kmYkqQnMAd1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2458,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/te8IvXwWpr15Bg2Nd5pjaoDkcIy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1638}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6270,"name":"high school"},{"id":2470,"name":"education"},{"id":161316,"name":"social documentary"},{"id":189920,"name":"harlem, new york city"},{"id":229276,"name":"progressive"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
