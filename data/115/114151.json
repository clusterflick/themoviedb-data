Drella was a nickname for Warhol coined by Warhol Superstar Ondine, a contraction of Dracula and Cinderella, used by Warhol's crowd. The song cycle focuses on Warhol's interpersonal relations and experiences, with songs falling roughly into three categories: Warhol's first-person perspective (which makes up the vast majority of the album), third-person narratives chronicling events and affairs, and first-person commentaries on Warhol by Reed and Cale themselves. The songs on the album are, to some extent, in chronological order.","popularity":0.7396,"poster_path":"/advdrJTZTmK3qBwfv8MDBVPqsDx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88121,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sire Records","origin_country":"US"},{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Songs for Drella","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Lou Reed & John Cale - Songs for Drella","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lou Reed","original_name":"Lou Reed","popularity":0.492,"profile_path":"/lWFiXdQtYHqr2EXnk5nhDFm36XF.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"59fc894fc3a3681adf02a628","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7491,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Cale","original_name":"John Cale","popularity":0.1622,"profile_path":"/wUidKhZJlXeYg1OMtrLvSrZFOoD.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"59fc8958c3a3681a1b02ef05","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":137179,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sandi Sissel","original_name":"Sandi Sissel","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628af9daf10a1a75c60e3ed6","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2455785,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Chris Rosen","original_name":"Chris Rosen","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628af9c05cea182dd0488194","department":"Lighting","job":"Electrician"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7491,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Cale","original_name":"John Cale","popularity":0.1622,"profile_path":"/wUidKhZJlXeYg1OMtrLvSrZFOoD.jpg","credit_id":"628af8a4ec45521884921f4e","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3560455,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aaron Sadovsky","original_name":"Aaron Sadovsky","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628af933ed2ac200a8ccdad5","department":"Directing","job":"Second Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1788826,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matthew T.
