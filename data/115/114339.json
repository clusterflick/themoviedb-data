However, in the foreground there is a dramatic story of a man who makes controversial choices on a daily basis and bears emotional, personal and ethical consequences. The title character turns out to be as ruthless as himself as to the people on whose lives he preys. Paparazzi is a movie about lost world values and bold rules - but shows that we always have a chance to decide what kind of man we will be tomorrow.","popularity":0.0869,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":52317,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wajda Studio","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2012-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paparazzi","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1058581,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Piotr Bernaś","original_name":"Piotr Bernaś","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b49c3a36847f81fc5ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1058581,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Piotr Bernaś","original_name":"Piotr Bernaś","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b49c3a36847f81fc5b3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1058581,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Piotr Bernaś","original_name":"Piotr Bernaś","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b49c3a36847f81fc5b9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2127340","wikidata_id":"Q82535358","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6025,"name":"photography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pl","note":"","release_date":"2012-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
