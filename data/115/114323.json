Film footage is used to lay the foundation for the failed conspiracy that perpetrators hoped would bring an end to the war fueled by Nazi propaganda. Scenes of adoring crowds cheering for Hitler are included to remind the viewer that those who resisted his evil machinations were in only a small minority of military officers among the Nazi faithful.","popularity":0.0755,"poster_path":"/foBny8ek0ziIyYud1KEDMmPuwrU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1839,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chronos Media","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1979-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The top secret trial of the Third Reich","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Caso Valkiria","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1058551,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Horst Schön","original_name":"Horst Schön","popularity":0.0623,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Erzähler/Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4b49c3a36847f81fc495","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":221300,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jochen Bauer","original_name":"Jochen Bauer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b49c3a36847f81fc491","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2338436,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bengt von zur Mühlen","original_name":"Bengt von zur Mühlen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636432f0d207f3007937a335","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3769521,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lola Braxton","original_name":"Lola Braxton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636431a440d0fe007acedd90","department":"Crew","job":"Dramaturgy"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3769526,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Evelyn Mundin","original_name":"Evelyn Mundin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6364324bd75bd6007b6f3464","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2506307,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rainer Lorenz","original_name":"Rainer Lorenz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636432cc1089ba007d61fdd1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1767108,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ilona Wasgint","original_name":"Ilona Wasgint","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63643256ecbde900825f2c8d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3769527,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brigitte Schirmann","original_name":"Brigitte Schirmann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63643291d75bd6007b6f3478","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1719701,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang de Gelmini","original_name":"Wolfgang de Gelmini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636432a3d207f3007937a328","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3769524,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manfred Helling","original_name":"Manfred Helling","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"636431e3458199007d231c8d","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3769525,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Karl-Heinz Janszen","original_name":"Karl-Heinz Janszen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6364322d858678007a1cc70b","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0347049","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1400,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/foBny8ek0ziIyYud1KEDMmPuwrU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":988}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
