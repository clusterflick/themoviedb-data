As Bagnato and Rehberg dig deeper, they find these practices at non-profit hospitals around the country.  When these discoveries are made public, Bagnato and Rehberg become the targets of threats and intimidation, and are eventually prosecuted by local authorities for blowing the whistle on the hospital's practices. With their reputations and livelihoods on the line, Bagnato and Rehberg must confront what they're willing to sacrifice to bring about justice.","popularity":0.0779,"poster_path":"/sufpEJPKXwIMhp7K4rfjMiZ1QQg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Do No Harm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":967964,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rebecca Schanberg","original_name":"Rebecca Schanberg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b56c3a36847f81feba9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1059479,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel Alpert","original_name":"Daniel Alpert","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b56c3a36847f81febaf","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":967964,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rebecca Schanberg","original_name":"Rebecca Schanberg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b56c3a36847f81febb5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1059480,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Suzanne Suffredin","original_name":"Suzanne Suffredin","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b56c3a36847f81febbb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1044163,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Brill","original_name":"Paul Brill","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b56c3a36847f81febc1","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1059480,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Suzanne Suffredin","original_name":"Suzanne Suffredin","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d6b7055aba320067c286cf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":958142,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dana Kupper","original_name":"Dana Kupper","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d6b70ed1a8930f10837814","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1313046","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sufpEJPKXwIMhp7K4rfjMiZ1QQg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
