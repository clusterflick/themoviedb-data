The resulting film from this journey is nothing short of magical.  Part road movie and part concert film, BIG EASY EXPRESS bears witness to the birth of a new musical era. With poignancy and beauty, Malloy documents these incredible musicians as they ride the rails and wow the crowds, from Oakland… to New Orleans.","popularity":0.7369,"poster_path":"/ihcK4C68PaEG268vuAdm1Yb0Bd9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72951,"logo_path":null,"name":"Woodshed Films Inc.","origin_country":""},{"id":72952,"logo_path":null,"name":"S2BN Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Big Easy Express","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":17,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1059008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Dwane","original_name":"Ted Dwane","popularity":0.1381,"profile_path":"/5f6CPzYbNuHcLO5T1c4ULmwi0sS.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4b4fc3a36847f81fd79d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1059009,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alex Ebert","original_name":"Alex Ebert","popularity":0.1781,"profile_path":"/nxl03WDDIHv3rtBruU4fHoUy0Q6.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4b4fc3a36847f81fd7a1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1059010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Winston Marshall","original_name":"Winston Marshall","popularity":0.2271,"profile_path":"/ze8WRXSL6iDYXOEPVao6fER9MLh.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4b4fc3a36847f81fd7a9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1059011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcus Mumford","original_name":"Marcus Mumford","popularity":0.2607,"profile_path":"/3widQCAShGo229D5IKOYlcvKliQ.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4b4fc3a36847f81fd7ad","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2300297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Lovett","original_name":"Ben Lovett","popularity":0.1903,"profile_path":"/sIHo9K1rHu4bgoyrjz26QdRo2ve.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5cc778289251412ba1fe5bd6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1059012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ketch Secor","original_name":"Ketch Secor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4b4fc3a36847f81fd7b1","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82222,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emmett Malloy","original_name":"Emmett Malloy","popularity":0.0849,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b4fc3a36847f81fd787","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82223,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tim Lynch","original_name":"Tim Lynch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b4fc3a36847f81fd78d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53392,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Cohl","original_name":"Michael Cohl","popularity":0.0866,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b4fc3a36847f81fd793","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":82225,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Giles Dunning","original_name":"Giles Dunning","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e0dee5076ce800adce8a77","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2316465","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9OMFhHSpemLcuD86kNj7ZtZtb7R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mEYau0gUcBzXqUAXtzhabxNSwVP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ihcK4C68PaEG268vuAdm1Yb0Bd9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vk2XsgJWF4YhPAl2pJPTWBnBsir.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6382,"name":"folk music"},{"id":13008,"name":"train"},{"id":156205,"name":"concert film"},{"id":180187,"name":"bluegrass"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
