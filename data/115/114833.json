It was recorded at the 2000 Montreux Jazz Festival in Montreux, Switzerland. Reed performed eight songs from the Album Ecstasy plus a few older ones. Lou Reed is one of the most influential artists of the rock era. From his days in the sixties as the main singer and songwriter of the Velvet Underground and through his mercurial solo career he has kept his audience and the critics on their toes with dramatic changes of musical direction from album to album. Underpinning everything however has been his unquestionable ability as a songwriter and performer of the highest class.
