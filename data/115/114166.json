Lygia's protector, the noble and  burly Ursus, works to save her from Vinicius' clutches. Pursuing Lygia, Vinicius finds himself at a catacomb prayer meeting led by the apostle Peter and finds his conscience stirring-- just as Nero orders Rome burned. A landmark in epic film, Enrico Guazzoni’s grand-scale masterpiece laid the foundations for what colossal Italian spectacles would become. The film had tremendous influence on Giovanni Pastrone’s Cabiria (1914) and D.W. Griffith’s Intolerance (1916).","popularity":0.4178,"poster_path":"/f79ax2LZMU8w4sdIYnNFB4ywQMV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12624,"logo_path":null,"name":"Società Italiana
