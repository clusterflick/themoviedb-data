The journey (450 miles, as a crow flies) across unmapped territory took seven months; three Muyu porters died. Near both coasts, the expedition met villagers who invited them to observe rituals and live with them. In the interior, all villagers kept them at bay, and they depended on air lifts from Hollandia for food and supplies. They climbed above 10,000 feet, built 14 bridges, and fought leeches and malaria. The narrator focuses on describing Stone Age savages, headhunters, and cannibals.","popularity":0.1245,"poster_path":"/dNKcc97ZaoAGZvd00bWYJ5hKpp4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1961-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Men of the space age meet men of the stone age.","title":"Sky Above and Mud Beneath","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le Ciel et la boue","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Sky Above –The Mud Below","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Sky Above, the Mud Below","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310272,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Georges Arnstam","original_name":"Georges Arnstam","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5890420592514103f0002dd0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10032,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arthur Cohn","original_name":"Arthur Cohn","popularity":0.0705,"profile_path":"/4elUZlTRNjY7OzzIY44Dg7zBfyH.jpg","credit_id":"589041b9c3a3687014002949","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1747879,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"René Lafuite","original_name":"René Lafuite","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"589041e2c3a3687014002976","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3457232,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre-Dominique Gaisseau","original_name":"Pierre-Dominique Gaisseau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64be58bd85c0a20125505a76","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3457232,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre-Dominique Gaisseau","original_name":"Pierre-Dominique Gaisseau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64be58ab0ed2ab00e2db519e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0053714","wikidata_id":"Q1332867","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bCqJWGmkhi8crXgaELXgEtDBjWD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b8wDyJHKj0AkvFhBbcebGK2X9Es.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dNKcc97ZaoAGZvd00bWYJ5hKpp4.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nFbHNdnDQTVfgnUsD6Hu3hh0YNl.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/XdBxW43kaE5cl5YEK3dQ29dKjz.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zIyTmeFoFG3jc3zW17zgeV6AIpY.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jHnH0ENVcfpOIH7dhvY7utdTTN7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9vR0OC3vWl4v6HcZtSItHOTQqI1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/gqqlcYYISyDEMyJAoHbCGSgOKma.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":752},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/nAcpjLJfLcJyb0Nfjof0zPUDc1L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1961-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cannes Film Festival","release_date":"1961-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1961-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1962-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
