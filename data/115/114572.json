Lacan refuses to allow security to haul off the student, lets him speak and incorporates such criticisms into his presentation. The packed performance took place at the Catholic University of Louvain on October 13, 1972, with Lacan interrelating death, language, love, alienation, paranoia and life. His talk is followed by a probing interview of Lacan on his concepts of psychoanalysis, conducted by the director, Belgian documentarian Francoise Wolff. One of only 2 known filmed appearances by Lacan, both by Wolff, who also made documentaries of Albert Einstein and Alexander Solzhenitsyn.","popularity":0.075,"poster_path":"/y9pwTcTPVVfxTCb1JszZhTEzwKJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":792,"logo_path":"/cRhBQP1FFNugNxKkO1pUgeD2Rkr.png","name":"RTBF","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jacques Lacan Speaks","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1890233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Lacan","original_name":"Jacques Lacan","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/Au9AxQ9xLmCOW1QWRS8OHjkRD1W.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"59bf3369c3a3682ff800ad63","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1890234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Françoise Wolff","original_name":"Françoise Wolff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b5466f60e0a26231202f3a7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1890234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Françoise Wolff","original_name":"Françoise Wolff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59bf3385c3a3682fd800a5cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1890235,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Christian Carez","original_name":"Christian Carez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c4bd7129251410e0a5909fd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2226367,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Youri Pachkoff","original_name":"Youri Pachkoff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c4bd7260e0a26495ad2b45f","department":"Camera","job":"Still Photographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353718,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Gérard Collet","original_name":"Gérard Collet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c4bd7380e0a2612ccc70d0f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2226372,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Michel Sternon","original_name":"Michel Sternon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c4bd74ac3a368478c8f13b0","department":"Crew","job":"Mix Technician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2226368,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Marc Lautal","original_name":"Marc Lautal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c4bd75ac3a36847898e3826","department":"Crew","job":"Title Graphics"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2226366,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"John Forrester","original_name":"John Forrester","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c4bd772c3a368477a8f3ecf","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2226371,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Josee Van Den Driessche","original_name":"Josee Van Den Driessche","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c4bd791c3a368576a8e07be","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2007748,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Albert Rupf","original_name":"Albert Rupf","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c4bd7b8c3a36847938e5b56","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2226373,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olivier Opdebeeck","original_name":"Olivier Opdebeeck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c4bd7c50e0a263ccdd21916","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0335241","wikidata_id":"Q5968667","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q5ldRthRh9la9VNurTt5D3IAMeC.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/y9pwTcTPVVfxTCb1JszZhTEzwKJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iCwgd1N0SWWm6WS3BGNF0HKUujt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"The seminar was filmed on October 13, 1972 as clearly stated in the film, but the documentary was not broadcast until 1982, clearly indicated by the fact that the beginning of the documentary gives Lacan's year of death as 1981.
