For a chance to study with the charismatic Jacques d'Amboise at the National Dance Institute. His philosophy--that creativity exists within everyone and that trying one's best ensures success--forms the foundation of a unique dance program. This documentary chronicles one school-year-long program including initial auditions, rehearsals, and the creation of an exclusive \"SWAT\" team, and culminates in an amazing, year-end performance at New York's Felt Forum. D'Amboise's enthusiasm is infectious--children, parents, teachers, professional dancers and musicians, and even local law enforcement officers find themselves involved in his productions. This Academy Award-winning documentary details the inspiring story of how one talented dancer's vision flourished into a coveted New York City dance program.","popularity":0.5482,"poster_path":"/a1tj8QW1A8br6pgd6C3Al7ppete.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1983-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"He Makes Me Feel Like Dancin'","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":980990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques d'Amboise","original_name":"Jacques d'Amboise","popularity":0.2671,"profile_path":"/sjgeqYKWLkYY2fGYzxhQrY500BV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5fb859475507e9003f4aa00c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Kline","original_name":"Kevin Kline","popularity":1.4282,"profile_path":"/ArH5dACd9AmWNNMnI6bGEkiFYIM.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65cd50df87f3f2017bf42994","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":716,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emile Ardolino","original_name":"Emile Ardolino","popularity":0.403,"profile_path":"/zWQ87XisfPtlSHjnfl9XMCYZcu6.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b4dc3a36847f81fd171","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2997,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Scott Rudin","original_name":"Scott Rudin","popularity":0.3486,"profile_path":"/sSaFhz7Fiq6T969nqQfvgeu7fyl.jpg","credit_id":"5c648d0b9251412fbffeff57","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0085655","wikidata_id":"Q5688866","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1dLN9pSqohm34tftUhNgRwDd4iG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/a1tj8QW1A8br6pgd6C3Al7ppete.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"1983 He Makes Me Feel Like Dancin Official Trailer 1 Edgar J Scherick Associates","key":"GVwk30tAwBw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-07-10T16:50:23.000Z","id":"5fb85923efe37c00406a7708"}]}}}
