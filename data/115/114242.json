The brilliant production was a huge success and ran for a couple of years. In 1959 Peter Gorski captured the performance on film in his directorial film debut. Basically it is a registration of the production, but Gorksi did manage to accentuate the details of the acting by using enough medium and close-up shots which give a view on the acting you normally would not able to see in a theater.","popularity":0.2691,"poster_path":"/sKhITjjuWJlrILEXfCPFNQpR2RZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1960-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":128,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Faust","video":false,"vote_average":7.281,"vote_count":16,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1005461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Quadflieg","original_name":"Will Quadflieg","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":"/3Y8kfwl2xX3Bv4WwLPu6rKbwko6.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Faust","credit_id":"52fe4b48c3a36847f81fbf23","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gustaf Gründgens","original_name":"Gustaf Gründgens","popularity":0.1166,"profile_path":"/lrkHay42kojkBJExFzhkFd6FJ8V.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mephisto","credit_id":"52fe4b48c3a36847f81fbf27","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisabeth Flickenschildt","original_name":"Elisabeth Flickenschildt","popularity":0.201,"profile_path":"/ve95zh3QgOZqnFhqPnaVqY4OtU3.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Gretchens Nachbarin Marthe Schwerdtlein","credit_id":"52fe4b48c3a36847f81fbf2b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1137714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hermann Schomberg","original_name":"Hermann Schomberg","popularity":0.0773,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Theaterdirektor","credit_id":"52fe4b48c3a36847f81fbf2f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eduard Marks","original_name":"Eduard Marks","popularity":0.1844,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Wagner","credit_id":"52fe4b48c3a36847f81fbf33","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36434,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uwe Friedrichsen","original_name":"Uwe Friedrichsen","popularity":0.2267,"profile_path":"/pPs50XLcso8836mSxz0q98beLaO.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Schüler","credit_id":"52fe4b48c3a36847f81fbf37","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310051,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ella Büchi","original_name":"Ella Büchi","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Gretchen","credit_id":"534c3835c3a36804410000a7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinz Reincke","original_name":"Heinz Reincke","popularity":0.2124,"profile_path":"/bYKnto0ri0cYhwGmbCqV4qyeaNG.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Frosch","credit_id":"534c3885c3a36804310000bb","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Friedrich G.
