That's what cuddly Dalmatian puppies Dot and Spot try to teach Ryan and Robin. When the family moves from the city to the woods right before Christmas, Ryan worries that Santa won't be able to find them. But when Santa's sleigh breaks down in the woods nearby, Dot and Spot must help Ryan and Robin fix it in time to save Christmas. Luckily, all animals can talk on Christmas Eve - and if you listen with an open heart, you'll discover that the magic of Santa follows you wherever you go.","popularity":1.5645,"poster_path":"/9FVBYCfXttAmB0u5jFQui5GzLyC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96345,"logo_path":"/mxmVRJx0vM2zcDYIlDebNZOmpT3.png","name":"Bohbot
