Stripping the images and sound from the original film, the remake retains only the film dialogues in the form of subtitles, rendering the original romantic tale into a hollow and ghostly story. The film dialogues, taken out-of-context and dissociated from the original images, become an allegorical conversation about displacement, alienation and cultural representations.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Moon is Larger in Peking","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2594488,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"IP Yuk-Yiu","original_name":"IP Yuk-Yiu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e8e236b2cefc20013302caa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
