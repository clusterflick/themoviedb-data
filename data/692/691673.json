Using the \"talking head\" confessional as a stylistic device, B creates a social and psychological narrative wherein the act of speaking becomes therapeutic affirmation. B asked individuals who had suffered domestic violence to compose and read letters to those who had abused them. Their stories, addressed to their abusers and spoken directly to the camera, are intercut with comments by serial killer Ted Bundy and quotes from convicted murderer Jack Henry Abbott's prison memoir, In the Belly of the Beast.","popularity":0.4425,"poster_path":"/647jIUAE0T6PiMp41kIBDRBWATf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Under Lock and Key","title":"Under Lock and Key","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2596562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Horvitz","original_name":"Philip Horvitz","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5e90815a197de40015076d93","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1339289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nan Goldin","original_name":"Nan Goldin","popularity":0.1905,"profile_path":"/emNf04TFb1sDPdbrYaJe43QnLXN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5e90816b197de4001307911d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2596563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomas Gaspar","original_name":"Tomas Gaspar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5e908185fdc1460018481765","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2596564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Kearns","original_name":"Jerry Kearns","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5e9081a1d35dea0018757e52","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clark Gregg","original_name":"Clark Gregg","popularity":1.6977,"profile_path":"/zwyhwrxgpiufSPpjC9dxCy5kAB0.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6730363611b6cc0571f6475f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1058066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beth B","original_name":"Beth B","popularity":0.1386,"profile_path":"/wpauaENRWLniKF1R42x1eFHPjw5.jpg","credit_id":"5e9075ff15959f0019edd29a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1306,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/647jIUAE0T6PiMp41kIBDRBWATf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":870}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1994-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
