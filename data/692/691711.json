This feeling is thwarted by her father, who would like to give her in marriage to Nicolino, a law student and son of a landowner, who has seen the girl only once and was struck by her beauty. Ahead of a party, her father prevents Anna from going out into the square where the band is scheduled to perform; the girl then comes up with the idea of delivering a note to Rosetta, the innkeeper's sister and a great friend of hers, finding mediation from Marcellino.","popularity":0.117,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1959-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Here comes the gang","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1046375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matteo Spinola","original_name":"Matteo Spinola","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5e908b434a4bf6001354488f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Fiore","original_name":"Maria Fiore","popularity":0.0996,"profile_path":"/14nh027Aad12LdSk6soU8pBvkwH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5e908b4fd35dea0018758e19","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlo Giuffrè","original_name":"Carlo Giuffrè","popularity":0.3072,"profile_path":"/adXGBbCswlVk5rq7UOMcx2vTfLm.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5e908b5f4a4bf60fa25122d2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":132479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Turi Pandolfini","original_name":"Turi Pandolfini","popularity":0.0709,"profile_path":"/5UlqZs6pzEY0x0dsXb0OmHyeCjP.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5e908b6fd35dea0013758d4e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alberto Sorrentino","original_name":"Alberto Sorrentino","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/vW8YO6Cf2s85hhioEqpV2bPIpX5.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5e908b7f00fb6b0015a19613","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1120721,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tanio Boccia","original_name":"Tanio Boccia","popularity":0.1303,"profile_path":"/vi3X9YhX2WbBVGsnFwXQESpQYxW.jpg","credit_id":"5e908b9937b3a900158a11bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0052576","wikidata_id":"Q29382856","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1959-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
