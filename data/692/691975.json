And it is with pyrotechnic art and fireworks that man's ancient relationship with fire is celebrated. The firework has a cathartic function, it removes the specter of war through the ritualized use of its most striking components: the din, the danger, the distant lights in the night. It also appears that pyrotechnics are closely linked to exorcism from the danger of volcanic eruptions: the firework free from the presence of evil spirits, which popular belief evokes in volcanic areas. Il Fuoco di Napoli traces the story of a man, Giuseppe Scudo, and his passion, the fireworks. His art and his life are one for him. This Neapolitan blaster challenges danger with clarity and intelligence. His work is a delicate alchemy of ancient knowledge, imagination and courage.","popularity":0.0589,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"IL FUOCO DI NAPOLI","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1202294,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alessandro Rossetto","original_name":"Alessandro Rossetto","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/l0YFHwS0LkSAiVlDSVhDVTppXSl.jpg","credit_id":"5e91af213679a1001338319f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
