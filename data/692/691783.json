The journey picks up at first light east of Maysville, Kentucky, and concludes with the stop in Clifton Forge, West Virginia, after traveling along the Ohio River, and later the famous New River Gorge. It's a rare treat to be onboard during the winter and on a crystal clear day. The music by Michael Lynch is exceptional for this video as well. Since it was winter we did not have the opportunity to do off train locations, but we have an added bonus of including some steam locomotive excursions that formerly traveled this same route east of Huntington and through the New River region.","popularity":0.0987,"poster_path":"/q7CQWyB435rwILRDTZaiaQNqRX3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13156,"logo_path":null,"name":"Railway Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":132388,"logo_path":null,"name":"Greg Scholl Video Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"America By Rail: Winter Wonderland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2605790,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Edwards Hingsbergen","original_name":"John Edwards Hingsbergen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5e9ac2d5eb79c200205b2337","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2605783,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Lynch","original_name":"Michael Lynch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9ac13ffd6fa10024019105","department":"Sound","job":"Music Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2605767,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Greg Scholl","original_name":"Greg Scholl","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9ac0b6076ce8001f2c5fe4","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1150008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Les Jarret","original_name":"Les Jarret","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9ac084310325001cc6a475","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q7CQWyB435rwILRDTZaiaQNqRX3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
