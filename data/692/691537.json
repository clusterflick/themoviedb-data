He’s joined in the war by Denise Richards, impossible to believe as a gifted starship pilot long before she was impossible to believe as a gifted nuclear scientist in that Bond movie. He’s also joined by the great Neil Patrick Harris, who is somehow much easier to believe as an intelligence officer with psychic abilities that help him communicate with the giant bug aliens. Throw in Michael Ironside, because duh, it’s a war movie, you’re gonna need Michael Ironside, and Jake Busey, because duh, he just showed up on set and wouldn’t leave, add a love triangle, heaps of alien splatter, and you’ve got the sprawling, great, goofy mess that is Starship Troopers!  Join Mike, Kevin, and Bill for this gorilla-gram free version of the blockbuster live show!","popularity":0.5777,"poster_path":"/xYyNDJ5n0ZWmTlEEJTsiKf7uNEF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15004,"logo_path":null,"name":"RiffTrax","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":132,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rifftrax Live: Starship Troopers","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30020,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael J.
