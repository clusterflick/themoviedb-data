The Christian Orthodox Church holds great power including among government officials, resulting in homophobic and transphobic violence and discrimination throughout the country, hate crimes and murders, and state-ordered threats against LGBTQI+ individuals and activists.  At the same time, the feminist and LGBTQI+ movements in Georgia are growing stronger and more organized. In “Living Out Loud,” we meet Eka Aghdgomelashvili, a Georgian feminist activist and trailblazer who led successful efforts to pass anti-discrimination laws in this former Soviet state. We also meet a young artist, Eka Tkemeladze, and fellow community activists who are mobilizing in the tense days leading up to the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia (IDAHOT) rally.","popularity":0.4187,"poster_path":"/ncL1K61k5CMBAPCQ8UMIre1iTIi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"}],"release_date":"2020-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fundamental: Living Out Loud","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1299467,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy","original_name":"Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy","popularity":0.3075,"profile_path":"/oFSp5SzYMzAJOtAU1AXPycMU8ag.jpg","credit_id":"5f6f5d70a6e2d2003a7c4f26","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12108844","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1027,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ncL1K61k5CMBAPCQ8UMIre1iTIi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":684}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Georgian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Georgian\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"ka\", \"native_name\"=>\"Georgian\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
