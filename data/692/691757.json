His friends – the baker, the butcher, the tailor and the shoemaker – are entranced by the honour and glory they would gain by venturing forth and exterminating the feral wolves. Unfortunately for their chances of success, Nikolajsen and Co. decide to hire Pat and Patachon as their hunting guides. And so the wolf hunters will probably end up chasing their own tails for a while before Nikolajsen can be reunited with his daughter.
