Our only hope is Rocky Lazer, the world's greatest pilot, athlete, marksman, sword-fighter, wrestler, and crooner. The President of the United States of Earth sends Rocky and his crew--the annoyingly loyal Chip Skipper, the brilliant Dr. Horst Karlock, and Jean Jarvis, the President's daughter and the Earth's first woman professor--on a dangerous mission into space to stop King Xayno and save the planet! Set in the innocent black-and-white world of 1930's serial adventure stories like Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers, Space Captain: Captain of Space is a modern, smart sci-fi comedy.","popularity":0.0479,"poster_path":"/8fftz3pCKZ0N83MxxUDjfFF5Jpd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131893,"logo_path":null,"name":"No Tea Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Space Captain: Captain of Space!","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2594610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Wise","original_name":"Matthew Wise","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/nF8JcVklTfVIeQmL3PiFu7DPJ7A.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Rocky Lazer","credit_id":"5e8e3c971365450014c6f52c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2594611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alicia Barnatchez","original_name":"Alicia Barnatchez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Jean Jarvis","credit_id":"5e8e3ca51365450019c6fd7a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2594612,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michele McNally","original_name":"Michele McNally","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Princess Astra","credit_id":"5e8e3cb31365450014c6f582","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3950198","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8fftz3pCKZ0N83MxxUDjfFF5Jpd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"“Space Captain: Captain of Space!” — TRAILER","key":"3JsGL5wDEJI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-03-09T16:47:54.000Z","id":"5e8e3d1ca14e10001a4e4ba1"}]}}}
