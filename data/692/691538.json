No, not the cronut trend, we’re talking about the omnipresent zombie craze! 28 Weeks Later, Resident Evil: Retribution, that Zack Snyder remake of Dawn of the Dead...We wouldn’t have any of them without Night of the Living Dead! (Pause to think about whether this is a good thing.)  When she’s attacked in a cemetery by zombies, a young woman named Barbara flees to an abandoned farm house. There she’s joined by a ragtag group of survivors who band together to wait out the apocalypse, with the occasional light descent into madness. The rest of the movie plays out like The Big Chill, but instead of Glenn Close sobbing naked in the shower, they board up windows and occasionally get devoured alive. So in this respect, Night of the Living Dead is the slightly less depressing movie.","popularity":0.3295,"poster_path":"/4MYgKao4M5mUCYucpHL1Sd67DVA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15004,"logo_path":null,"name":"RiffTrax","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RiffTrax Live: Night of the Living Dead","video":false,"vote_average":9.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30020,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael J.
