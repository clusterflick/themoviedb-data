A wild child and a rebel at heart, this legendary Argentinean musician is surrounded by an aura of mystery: some find her too uncompromising, others generous and beautiful, yet to all she is without doubt incredibly talented. Thanks to these \"evening talks\", Georges Gachot lifts a corner of the veil: Martha Argerich shares with us her memories, confides in us her doubts, and transmits to us her incredible appetite for music making. Images of Argentina, rehearsals in the concert hall or at home, excerpts of recent concerts and archival clips complete this unique film on one of the most secretive and endearing artists of our time.","popularity":0.1634,"poster_path":"/xUmgqvC4klve4mg7524DmpqKtyq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52722,"logo_path":null,"name":"Georges Gachot","origin_country":""},{"id":2606,"logo_path":"/2KJaKgKrsJE3JXpp2pf2TQpxomf.png","name":"Idéale Audience","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":150566,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gachot Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2002-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Documentary, Music","title":"Martha Argerich Evening Talks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"Frankreich","title":"Martha Argerich, conversation nocturne","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"Deutschland","title":"Martha Argerich, Nachtgespräch","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1163689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martha Argerich","original_name":"Martha Argerich","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/2ZnEkOidTSfw0ImLV8UJ9ebTtds.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"herself","credit_id":"6047e65654508d002541ea78","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41201,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Matthias Kälin","original_name":"Matthias Kälin","popularity":0.0839,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6047e4388741c40070c5fa17","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65460,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Gachot","original_name":"Georges Gachot","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/9rS8UQEru5kWmqaG8UTet5LyPMC.jpg","credit_id":"6047e41e54508d007757986b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65460,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Gachot","original_name":"Georges Gachot","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/9rS8UQEru5kWmqaG8UTet5LyPMC.jpg","credit_id":"6047ed5090dde000463f4cfb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3004384,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ruth Schläpfer","original_name":"Ruth Schläpfer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6047e7819e4586005a71b65d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1382676,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jürg von Allmen","original_name":"Jürg von Allmen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f161fb880c92007f17975d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0384318","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"Argericheveningtalks","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":842,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xUmgqvC4klve4mg7524DmpqKtyq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":595},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/ypwq2GDMuB50tCTHTETwgixSy5V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":341132,"name":"martha argerich"},{"id":341133,"name":"argentine classical concert pianist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"MARTHA ARGERICH, EVENING TALKS - Official Trailer","key":"tQ9bI-b2L4M","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2008-07-08T16:26:19.000Z","id":"6047e99190dde000463f483e"}]}}}
