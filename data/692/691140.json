Cutting and mapping images from the heroic finale in real-time with custom software, Peckinpah’s final shootout is transformed into a psychedelic orgy of fetishistic self-destruction that borders between the sublime and the mundane. The never-ending cycles of senseless killings mirror and unwind the obsessive-compulsive disorder of (male) destructive heroism/eroticism that haunts the history of narrative cinema.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"WE WANT ANGEL","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2594488,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"IP Yuk-Yiu","original_name":"IP Yuk-Yiu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e8e25f901e4d10014042ee4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
