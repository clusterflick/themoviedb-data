Expecting a male parson, the boys set out in full force to receive him, but on the road when they suddenly run into the one-horse shay of a female parson, they keel over in surprise. Right after her arrival the boys begin to lay plans to get in right, while the parson loses no time in starting a campaign for the defeat of Satan. She begins by posting a sign near the town horse trough to the effect that \"Cleanliness is next to Godliness.\" Of course the boys see the sign and immediately there is a sudden disposition among them to make use of soap, water and brush. One cowboy in particular is very much in love with the parson. He shows his affection only too plainly, and so the boys decide to play a trick on him. Their practical joke unintentionally is not only the means of frustrating a plot against the parson, but it brings the parson and her lover together.","popularity":0.1057,"poster_path":"/tBe09FYhQgdCZF1JOHpFO0djO4t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26305,"logo_path":null,"name":"Solax Film Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parson Sue","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Quirk","original_name":"Billy Quirk","popularity":0.0975,"profile_path":"/mVRHKE8gPNB3b3BEKIZ1rAj0W4f.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Cowboy","credit_id":"5e8f3dffe640d6001b1d7d5b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1223501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blanche Cornwall","original_name":"Blanche Cornwall","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":"/aqTGfdEDULjqt4QdnaS7JtQJbe3.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Parson Sue","credit_id":"5e91eff215376c0015fe2fcf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1223500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darwin Karr","original_name":"Darwin Karr","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":"/miU21JZlTzhaW7b4cXJ5VjCshWn.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lucky Bill","credit_id":"62b3f4e053f83304d55e6186","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":985839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gladden James","original_name":"Gladden James","popularity":0.0955,"profile_path":"/uW1fpWXpEo2mLneq95yO004xQNs.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sleeky Sam","credit_id":"62b3f4f3025764005276a4d4","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1071403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alice Guy-Blaché","original_name":"Alice Guy-Blaché","popularity":0.2645,"profile_path":"/y1atPvIVDpS2pJR2rnQZ4VR7ULM.jpg","credit_id":"5e8f3e0bd35dea0018739cf4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0872138","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tBe09FYhQgdCZF1JOHpFO0djO4t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source is Kino Lorber Alice-Guy Blache box-set.","release_date":"1912-01-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
