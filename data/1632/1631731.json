When COVID-19 began spreading globally and Japan’s borders started to close, Kondo chose to shelter in place with her family in Japan, overstaying her visa waiver on her U.S. passport. Now unable to leave Japan without risking re-entry denial, Kondo is fighting back by suing the Japanese government and joining a growing movement to challenge Japan’s outdated single-nationality law and redefine what it means to be Japanese in a globally connected world.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Kokusekihou: The Fight to Change Japan's Nationality Law (Working Title)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Kokuseikhou","type":"Typographical Error"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Kokusekihou","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317533,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Megumi Nishikura","original_name":"Megumi Nishikura","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698901c325d4f8c9798fd14e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3790367,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shiho Fukada","original_name":"Shiho Fukada","popularity":0.1259,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698901fd64311b4bc9c1cbb3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5995644,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Keisuke Shingu","original_name":"Keisuke Shingu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698902106c26679a2ff81304","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Camera"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
