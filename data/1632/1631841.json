Years later, two of them reunite as adults with sharply different lives: Zhiyong, a rigid road maintenance worker, and Weihao, a slick freeloader living off a wealthy patron. Their youngest brother, Tianyou, has vanished after years in foster care. A chance street incident brings Zhiyong and Weihao together, along with a new friend, Bao Zai.
