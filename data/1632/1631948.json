The film opens on a primeval forest, then moves through streams and ponds within the woods, before ultimately focusing on the movements of the water’s surface and the play of light upon it. The treatment of the black-and-white negative, combined with toning and tinting processes, radically transforms the landscape and creates an intense visionary realm. The water lies like a pool of fire within the emanating forest. The sun becomes a black star, flickering, vaporizing into a form of energy and protozoan eruption before sinking into a flow of lava.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"EMANANCE","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
