Based on real events, Stay in the Car explores the fragile line between safety and survival, love and neglect. It invites audiences into a world where survival depends on silence, and one young girl must decide whether to remain in her mother's chaos or step into her own uncertain freedom.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/hAKxiGK6bGyGSi4ahDQQSe8b6mL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2026-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"A choice that could change her life forever.","title":"Stay in the car","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5995291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lara Hunter","original_name":"Lara Hunter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/gvdGmHysAV3sqh9VSfATkytFfGp.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Salem","credit_id":"6988e1fa933384e05a8fd00e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1524368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashley Alva","original_name":"Ashley Alva","popularity":3.3198,"profile_path":"/dMkUaW7ZAZsDBtyhmPzwpka8Ca1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dee","credit_id":"6988e1dec67b55cb918fcf00","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy V.
