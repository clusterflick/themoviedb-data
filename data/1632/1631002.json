The unseen written traces seep from the murmuring land, pushing through fragmented voices to become new forms, beings made material. Framed as a dialogue with my grandmother, this film explores an alternative form of personal writing by Chinese women in political shifts, absent and abundant. The 'blank' becomes an image, carrying a search for agency; of land transformed and of women unheard. By breaking down linguistic structures, the film opens a space for imagining, reading, and performing, allowing for emergence.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/oW6Vd0Vf3Ut64ZsgWOYPkb8NyQi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2025-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Words Fly Back to the Black Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5992701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shumei Chen","original_name":"Shumei Chen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Shumei Chen","credit_id":"69874724ea012e3fc52ce344","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":4186045,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xiao Zhang","original_name":"Xiao Zhang","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/tY21MydJAVt8Ua8bFYUCQATdXJE.jpg","credit_id":"6987460e78e13fd08a5ca418","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1286572,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aidan Reynolds","original_name":"Aidan Reynolds","popularity":0.1189,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6987468313a2dcd3b58fc760","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oW6Vd0Vf3Ut64ZsgWOYPkb8NyQi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3371,"name":"family history"},{"id":296071,"name":"experimental documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"","release_date":"2025-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
