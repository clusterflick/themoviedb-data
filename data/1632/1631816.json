From there, Helena Molin’s long-term portrait unfolds—of a generation forced early on to confront the ruthlessness of politics. Their fight for the climate and for justice runs parallel to a life that should be about friendship, play, and future dreams, but is repeatedly interrupted by the failures of the adult world. The result is an intimate and powerful depiction of what happens when moral responsibility is placed in the hands of those still searching for their place in the world.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2026-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Strejkarna","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5996123,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helena Molin","original_name":"Helena Molin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698949293f4c2568af8fd2d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt39195155","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1153,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n0TKj590kFk8ML81gP6zirSXXvN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2050}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Tempo Documentary Festival","release_date":"2026-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
