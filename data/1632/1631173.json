Pressured by the Brazilian dictatorship and in conflict with Church hierarchy, they broke with the institution, took a vow of anonymity, and fled into exile in Rome, escaping aboard cargo ships. Today, the fifteen women who remain from the original group agree, for the first time, to share their story.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2025-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sorelle Senza Nome","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1785901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathas de Andrade","original_name":"Jonathas de Andrade","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69879f536d16f9143b5d8887","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1546382,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Miguel da Santa","original_name":"Miguel da Santa","popularity":0.2292,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69879f5c0a8f537993f80b3e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1590057,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tiago Carvalho","original_name":"Tiago Carvalho","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69879f6a0a8f537993f80b41","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1831886,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luís Costa","original_name":"Luís Costa","popularity":0.089,"profile_path":"/koRy0RR9ukvQLVvQux8TbRjYbBj.jpg","credit_id":"69879f74200929f9ccc1c56b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2792783,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Diogo Pinto","original_name":"Diogo Pinto","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69879f7ebe89ada48b2ce553","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"Museo d'Arte Contemporanea Roma","release_date":"2025-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
