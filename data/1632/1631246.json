The term \"Burlesque\" originated in 17th-century Italy, referring to literary, theatrical, and musical works of a parodic nature intended to satirize the customs of the era. Set in the Serra Gaúcha during the 1950s, the story blends Talian and Portuguese within a village defined by hard labor, respect, order, and faith. In this rigid world, a young woman’s longing for freedom rattles the traditions and beliefs surrounding her. It is a tale that portrays the struggle for free will and independence among the women of the colonial settlements.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Post
