Like the Acropolis of Athens. Fence, border that surrounds it. Structural Boundary.  τεμενος²: Place-event near the village of Lyssarea, in Arcadia, chosen by Gregory Markopoulos for the projection of his ultimate opus Eniaios. Robert Beavers organizes the event every four years.  τεμενος³: Documentation of the pilgrimage to τεμενος², from Barbança to Lyssarea and back. The times and places get mixed up when they share the same precinct, i.e. the screen. The limits of the screen as a border, as a τεμενος¹, as structural boundary of a square space where mental work can take place. The time of Eniaios becomes space in this film, the emptiness of space, space as time inside the frontiers of the frame.  Five seconds, on the way out —deferred editing. 125 frames, on the way back —contiguous editing. Sometimes the movement in space breaks free from this strict time boundary.","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"temenos³","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1748136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberte Pagán","original_name":"Alberte Pagán","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6988d588cdf77f6d478fd045","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
