What begins as an eroding scar in the landscape becomes a threat to drain wetlands, degrade critical sage-grouse habitat and disrupt water flowing downstream. Through collaboration, grit, and innovative restoration, this short documentary reveals how working lands and wildlife can thrive together and why protecting water at its source is essential for the resilience of rivers, communities, and all ecosystems downstream.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/qVdyqi43FePAniQj61s4FTOeVCq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Headcut in the Headwaters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3553874,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Attwater","original_name":"Tom Attwater","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6987a5c4ec4f7b6aac3a9b2d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qVdyqi43FePAniQj61s4FTOeVCq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
