This marked not only the beginning of the creation of the short story collection “Cavalos do amanhecer” (Horses of Dawn), but also the start of a deep friendship between them, conducted almost entirely through letters. “Mario Arregui and Sergio Faraco - Friendship without Borders” is a documentary that seeks to understand a statement made by Faraco about this friendship: “He was my greatest and dearest friend. And I only saw him once.”","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mario Arregui e Sergio Faraco - Amizade Sem Fronteiras","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3797508,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rafael Valles","original_name":"Rafael Valles","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69890350bff09749728e7006","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2507711,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Renan Franzen","original_name":"Renan Franzen","popularity":0.1719,"profile_path":"/iV6OnESKwSBklXQ6981JYVG1aRS.jpg","credit_id":"69890364c9142957012ceb5b","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3797508,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rafael Valles","original_name":"Rafael Valles","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6989037a9434c8fa2f8e6e99","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1428759,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Germano de Oliveira","original_name":"Germano de Oliveira","popularity":0.1123,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6989038ddb18961c2a5caec6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
