Set entirely within Ahwet Nakhlet el Tineen (Dragon Palm Café), run by the proud owner and performer Nakhle, the play follows his quest to replace himself as the café's main attraction. After a failed audition process, a talented newcomer (Marwan Mahfouz) arrives with a captivating voice. Fearing his daughter Yasmeen's (Georgette Sayegh) growing affection for the young singer, Nakhle initially refuses to let him perform—until a change of heart alters the course of all their lives.  The play is celebrated for its iconic musical numbers, including classics like \"Ya Bint El Ma'awan\" and \"Nattarni.\"","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/pww8uvj2cm7Cz1pz0C1fxwN3aHo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sahriye","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4522701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Sakr","original_name":"Joseph Saqr","popularity":0.3346,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"the café owner of Nakhlet el Tineen","credit_id":"6987cf1dfc0ebe56662ce648","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4175487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgette Sayegh","original_name":"Georgette Sayegh","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/idEH317QqC84KUaAIT17vWwNiRw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Yasmeen, son of the café owner","credit_id":"6987cf41ea012e3fc52ce6ea","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5993717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marwan Mahfouz","original_name":"Marwan Mahfouz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The new singer","credit_id":"6987cfa902a66bc973c1c68c","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2770612,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ziad Rahbani","original_name":"Ziad Rahbani","popularity":0.1907,"profile_path":"/hbUVTJ9rHbqOCNLQyC7DF7pE08I.jpg","credit_id":"6987cffd639dbeed068c8ce2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4001017,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Abou Samah","original_name":"Nicolas Abou Samah","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6987d01cd6b2f86d295d895e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":917,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fUIwruLF7RnGx534z5sWyXRrZ81.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1632}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":802,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pww8uvj2cm7Cz1pz0C1fxwN3aHo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":535}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"1973-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
