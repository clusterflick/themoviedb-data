This installment makes its way across Eastern and Central Europe, moth tracking from the Baltics to the Balkans, fluttering about the Caucasus region.  With a curiosity for the ordinary, 'places in pieces vol. 4' is an observation of quiet moments, contemplating time and memory. The film score is composed by Adam Parks (Lighting White Bison).","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/3aZxPvvCJZuVVveIZujXOHZScPr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"places in pieces vol. 4","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5598932,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jason Pappariella","original_name":"Jason Pappariella","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/nZ4tOYQh170EsC2wIAjIazwPaOV.jpg","credit_id":"698964dafc0ebe56662cf149","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5599488,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Adam Parks","original_name":"Adam Parks","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/pIW8MUBJ60QsN6f5PiqvUlrBmZ2.jpg","credit_id":"69896551200929f9ccc1cfa5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5599488,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Adam Parks","original_name":"Adam Parks","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/pIW8MUBJ60QsN6f5PiqvUlrBmZ2.jpg","credit_id":"6989657c02a66bc973c1ced6","department":"Sound","job":"Music Arranger"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5598932,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jason Pappariella","original_name":"Jason Pappariella","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/nZ4tOYQh170EsC2wIAjIazwPaOV.jpg","credit_id":"69896635857bfaa0215cae41","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5598932,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jason Pappariella","original_name":"Jason Pappariella","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/nZ4tOYQh170EsC2wIAjIazwPaOV.jpg","credit_id":"6989664ead6fb2342a3aa471","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5598932,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jason Pappariella","original_name":"Jason Pappariella","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/nZ4tOYQh170EsC2wIAjIazwPaOV.jpg","credit_id":"6989665fdf36c138c73aa47c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5598934,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Stauffer","original_name":"Dan Stauffer","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/sDiw8i7mrRmfHAlDAVmfv9PVlyX.jpg","credit_id":"6989667c04a63e37428c96ba","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5996206,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Henry Stauffer","original_name":"Henry Stauffer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698966a24188a3a24d8c982f","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5599488,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Adam Parks","original_name":"Adam Parks","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/pIW8MUBJ60QsN6f5PiqvUlrBmZ2.jpg","credit_id":"698966b6e4592795bd3aa435","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5599488,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Adam Parks","original_name":"Adam Parks","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/pIW8MUBJ60QsN6f5PiqvUlrBmZ2.jpg","credit_id":"69896a3d04a63e37428c96d7","department":"Sound","job":"Music Score Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1534,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3aZxPvvCJZuVVveIZujXOHZScPr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1151}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2026-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"places in pieces vol 4 - trailer","key":"ozY4NXvVPFI","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-09-20T20:54:07.000Z","id":"69896ab1ea012e3fc52cee87"}]}}}
