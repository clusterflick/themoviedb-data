It was contested between the visiting Chicago Bulls and the Utah Jazz. In the closing seconds of the game, the Bulls guard Michael Jordan executed a quick cross-over on Jazz forward Bryon Russell, and then hit a game-winning jumpshot from behind the free throw line to give the Bulls a 87–86 lead with 5.2 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter. The Bulls held on to win the game after John Stockton missed a three-point field goal, winning their sixth NBA championship in eight years.  Game 6 was the final game with the Bulls for Michael Jordan and coach Phil Jackson; both would retire from the NBA, then eventually return. It is widely cited as one of the most intense and iconic games in NBA history. It earned, and still holds, the highest television ratings of an NBA game of all time.[1]","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/3mug13kF7hUjBU7S8e74JxKUGHc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-06-14","revenue":38,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Last Dance","title":"NBA Finals 1998 Game 6","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Jordan","original_name":"Michael Jordan","popularity":2.487,"profile_path":"/tCqjwlROe98wYbcRhCcp3qYsUc5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self (Guard, Chicago Bulls)","credit_id":"6987c26dfcec680ace5ca7b2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scottie Pippen","original_name":"Scottie Pippen","popularity":0.5957,"profile_path":"/uBzeHR11hd67PpcW7btIsfOf65n.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self (Forward, Chicago Bulls)","credit_id":"6987c27be5db90f0fe5d89d3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Rodman","original_name":"Dennis Rodman","popularity":1.1875,"profile_path":"/tIYGMFJvBZ30HY3KlVQ0evoaEKV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self (Forward, Chicago Bulls)","credit_id":"6987c2a04b4d0e70d0c1c528","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1177525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Jackson","original_name":"Phil Jackson","popularity":1.8494,"profile_path":"/tpeWFZsOhKLYEOtswSwQHdbtJ6x.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self (Coach, Chicago Bulls)","credit_id":"6987c2c14188a3a24d8c8e07","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2582450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ron Harper","original_name":"Ron Harper","popularity":0.3277,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self (Guard, Chicago Bulls)","credit_id":"6987c2dad8c893b7628c8df4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Malone","original_name":"Karl Malone","popularity":0.4762,"profile_path":"/hPg9xl8Esl5sJET17iYL7rcbtLh.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self (Forward, Utah Jazz)","credit_id":"6987c2e9e5db90f0fe5d89d7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1072347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Stockton","original_name":"John Stockton","popularity":0.1062,"profile_path":"/8vQRXk0DGGGQRRW9gpIOlzd6E3m.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self (Guard, Utah Jazz)","credit_id":"6987c2fae5db90f0fe5d89db","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4857965,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Hornacek","original_name":"Jeff Hornacek","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self (Guard, Utah Jazz)","credit_id":"6987c30794d54b62482ce649","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5993556,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryon Russell","original_name":"Bryon Russell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self (Guard, Utah Jazz)","credit_id":"6987c3b3dda0469b085ca679","order":8}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15167744","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":788,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rQxbgK44w6ndtLHzyi5nvGoBodP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":1656,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3mug13kF7hUjBU7S8e74JxKUGHc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1152}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1998-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
