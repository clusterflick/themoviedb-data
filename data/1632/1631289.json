While the rally itself provides the physical framework of the film, Rally Kats is ultimately a portrait of identity, optimism, and belonging. Shot across back roads, mountain passes, and small towns, the film uses the vast American landscape as a backdrop for a deeply personal immigrant story.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rally Kats","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5993959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kat","original_name":"Kat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6987f6a9f9799eaa17f80e80","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5993960,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kiyo","original_name":"Kiyo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6987f6b7352610a13ef80cd8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5993954,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Martinez","original_name":"David Martinez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"698834b7ed70ae790cf80ec5","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5993954,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Martinez","original_name":"David Martinez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6987f5aedda0469b085ca78d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5993954,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Martinez","original_name":"David Martinez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6987f6effcec680ace5ca8a8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5993954,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Martinez","original_name":"David Martinez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6987f7050ae9ddf9c68e6aad","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5993954,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Martinez","original_name":"David Martinez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6987f71c6998c0dd925d8a1c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5993954,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Martinez","original_name":"David Martinez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6987f72faea1d7cc672ce767","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
