Freeing the plot from the conventions of the 18th century opera seria, Gluck introduces fluidity to the drama. The rigid alternation of aria and recitativo is abandoned; continuity and unity are the cornerstones of Gluck's reform. The movement of Gluck’s music - with its lyrical intensity  and the interweaving of chorus, solo singing and dance - appeals to theatre makers from all horizons.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orfeo ed Euridice – Teatro Regio di Parma","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2228836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlo Vistoli","original_name":"Carlo Vistoli","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Orfeo","credit_id":"69889f6c9131f8b260c1cb70","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5994817,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesca Pia Vitale","original_name":"Francesca Pia Vitale","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Euridice","credit_id":"69889f7fc6abea1071c1c961","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5994819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theodora Raftis","original_name":"Theodora Raftis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Amore","credit_id":"69889f977c2ad33ff2f81006","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1354691,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christoph Willibald Gluck","original_name":"Christoph Willibald Gluck","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69889fab6d16f9143b5d8d6e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1569641,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ranieri de’ Calzabigi","original_name":"Raniero de Calzabigi","popularity":0.1557,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69889fcd200929f9ccc1cb2e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":144492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shirin Neshat","original_name":"Shirin Neshat","popularity":3.7309,"profile_path":"/2sLZvr1pNtwFaCzTMKo1U1NYs8l.jpg","credit_id":"69889fd4ed70ae790cf8112f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2137204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabio Biondi","original_name":"Fabio Biondi","popularity":0.1738,"profile_path":"/kBrFdLE3WJP22OvWMEhJvazjciZ.jpg","credit_id":"69889fe09f058a8ad83a9f04","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2026-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
