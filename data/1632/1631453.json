Just outside of Tamworth in country New South Wales, a freight train hits someone lying on the tracks. But when a rail worker looks at the body, the scene doesn’t seem to make sense. 25 years later, journalist Allan Clarke picks up the case and the more time he spends with Mark’s family, the more he feel he’s becoming a part of it. Allan tells a story of a town divided, an investigation bungled, evidence lost...and critical leads never followed up.","popularity":0.0786,"poster_path":"/h86S2aEOUWAhgWdlH5TaC7FQHIV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blood on the Tracks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30647512","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8C3sBxiHjeqWUJzMfC9g15Au4g2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/h86S2aEOUWAhgWdlH5TaC7FQHIV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
