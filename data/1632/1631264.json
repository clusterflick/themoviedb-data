That is, until he finds out about \"The Squip\" - a tiny supercomputer that promises to bring him everything he desires most: a date with Christine, an invite to the raddest party of the year and a chance to survive life in his suburban New Jersey high school. But is being the most popular guy in school worth the risk? Blending the contemporary with retro sci-fi, \"Be More Chill\" takes on the competing voices in all of our heads. And ultimately proves, there's never been a better time in history to be yourself-especially if you're a loser...geek...or whatever.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/c5JvRYuzXVpnOxQK7C5JumBaJs2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"What if popularity came in a pill?
