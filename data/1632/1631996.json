The Nimvar stream is eighteen kilometers long, and an old dam redirects some of the water from the Khomein river into it, which is used for farming in Nimvar and Baqerabad. Every March, the people of Nimvar, led by Mirjoy Nimvar, an experienced farmer, get together to dredge the Nimvar stream. They start by breaking the Bahrama dam.
