The play features two main characters: a boy, Oscar, who is terminally ill, and the Pink Lady, one of the caregivers dressed in pink, who looks after sick children. The Pink Lady, or as Oscar calls her, Pink Mama, offers the boy a game — every day he \"lives\" 10 years of his life. In the 10 days remaining before the boy's death, his entire life unfolds: from childhood, youth, and marriage, to old age and death. Additionally, on the Pink Lady's advice, Oscar turns to God and writes Him letters.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/qlTfMRaVfwYYvZEGpy9Uza9VvTz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65961,"logo_path":"/AsclP6964QPtRyomh38vXku6Oxc.png","name":"Russia-K","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2007-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oscar and the Lady in Pink","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":28079,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alisa Freyndlikh","original_name":"Алиса Фрейндлих","popularity":0.9349,"profile_path":"/6r90VxIyPWE63DnBS91xeomZmIP.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6988cd3c8eff89a33f5cac66","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2611492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oleg Korvyakov","original_name":"Олег Корвяков","popularity":0.3105,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6988cb311eff9bde295cac8c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1940396,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yuriy Zhuravlyov","original_name":"Юрий Журавлёв","popularity":0.1454,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6988cb3c0ae9ddf9c68e6f4c","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5822334,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tatyana Aleksandrova","original_name":"Татьяна Александрова","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6988cb4e4cf54eb67a8e6efe","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5817728,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Vladimir Kuzakov","original_name":"Владимир Кузаков","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6988cb581eff9bde295cac91","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5822290,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Oleg Malikov","original_name":"Олег Маликов","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6988cb63af11fd5736c1cb09","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5817731,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrey Morozov","original_name":"Андрей Морозов","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6988cb92fb68adc6768e6f29","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5852188,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Aleksandr Petrovskiy","original_name":"Александр Петровский","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6988cb9e4cf54eb67a8e6f02","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5995176,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Mariya Bryantseva","original_name":"Мария Брянцева","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6988cbb6e4592795bd3aa168","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6543,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Éric-Emmanuel Schmitt","original_name":"Éric-Emmanuel Schmitt","popularity":0.3546,"profile_path":"/sN3sAox6aE8IiNt569rKjbhmz1c.jpg","credit_id":"6988cbd849237bd57a3a9f59","department":"Writing","job":"Author"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":587926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladislav Pazi","original_name":"Владислав Пази","popularity":0.2311,"profile_path":"/3AbY3vebFuLDqClnQvJuTHTbo4U.jpg","credit_id":"6988cca2913bd896b1f811e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qlTfMRaVfwYYvZEGpy9Uza9VvTz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
