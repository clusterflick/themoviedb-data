This horror/comedy spoofs everything from “The Twilight Zone” and Dr. Seuss to “Die Hard” and “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.”  One fateful Halloween night, two employees of a certain motion picture equipment house discover a very unusual film.  They decide to thread it up, and the rest becomes a very memorable Halloween indeed!  Filled with vicious female vampires and an assortment of creepy characters, The Macabre Pair of Shorts “fits so tightly, you might find it hard to breathe.” – Don Murphy (Producer “Natural Born Killers”, “From Hell”).","popularity":0.3985,"poster_path":"/cvtW03izfLcuP2AqC60YULIA8cv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3052,"logo_path":"/kqP7DC8cUCzDSI5SXiJKJKmQg1K.png","name":"Troma Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Comedy of Terrors!","title":"Macabre Pair of Shorts","video":false,"vote_average":1.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Boreanaz","original_name":"David Boreanaz","popularity":1.5638,"profile_path":"/oO619MACIfz7YoPiIGXYOfamhOE.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dinner (segment \"MPS\")","credit_id":"5fad61b443cd54003c93ce29","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1209085,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Scott Mabbutt","original_name":"Scott Mabbutt","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e109251416c7514a257","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1209086,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sean Manton","original_name":"Sean Manton","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e109251416c7514a25d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1209085,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Scott Mabbutt","original_name":"Scott Mabbutt","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fad61919590e3003ef825ec","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0116951","wikidata_id":"Q11765197","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cvtW03izfLcuP2AqC60YULIA8cv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
