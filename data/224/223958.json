Fueled by gin and sheer determination, Elizabeth James (Ms. Liz) operates her third generation dairy farm outside the region's domineering co-ops. To help keep the place afloat, she's employed five renegade ranch hands. These boys have put a pin in responsibility and opted to stretch out the party as long as possible. Unfortunately, women, booze, and fisticuffs can only lead to one outcome: trouble. With the dairy farm reporting its third straight deficit year, Ms Liz is attracting some unwanted attention. Delbert Furgeson, the owner of the area's largest co-op, is pushing to buy her out. This only incenses the prideful Ms Liz and starts a volatile feud between the two. Sharing the narrative are the ranch hands.","popularity":2.1732,"poster_path":"/8ZtCpnlzfPz7wY6GVCrSXiOPS9o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost on Purpose","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":27725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Kaczmarek","original_name":"Jane Kaczmarek","popularity":1.1599,"profile_path":"/feFWEstrs4gHDIYNMACdvMGdNb9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ms. Liz","credit_id":"52fe4e299251416c7514d5a1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"C.
