With a Swiss army knife she robs an American Express Bank in Morocco, accosts a shepherd in a field on International Women's Day, and tap dances on Shirley Temple's star on Hollywood Boulevard. This child movie star was the ideal by which Hammer's ambitious mother measured her own Barbie. Grandma, already a cook for Lillian Gish in Hollywood, introduced the cute, loquacious child and her mother to D.W. Griffith. Lesbian autobiography is a slender genre, so Hammer draws from general culture studies for critique and to provide an ironic edge to the synthesized \"voices of authority\".","popularity":0.047,"poster_path":"/ipTc1PUA5uM2rgBfurTpLGDtafZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tender Fictions","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1184106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Hammer","original_name":"Barbara Hammer","popularity":0.1204,"profile_path":"/1YMUsZHPEVqLfxzrvauPulfR1wr.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5cbd9b990e0a266b96f9110e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1184106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Hammer","original_name":"Barbara Hammer","popularity":0.1204,"profile_path":"/1YMUsZHPEVqLfxzrvauPulfR1wr.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e169251416c7514ae67","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0114646","wikidata_id":"Q7699585","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.739,"height":755,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ipTc1PUA5uM2rgBfurTpLGDtafZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":558}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Ann Arbor Film Festival","release_date":"1995-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Tender Fictions (Trailer)","key":"awXesvC9ZBQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-07-20T07:25:23.000Z","id":"65ec921d924ce6014b413ed4"}]}}}
