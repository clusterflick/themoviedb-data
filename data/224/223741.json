When the blinding sun coming through the window suddenly forces him back into life with Mitzi and Teresita—but without Teresa—he asks what good it is if she’s reincarnated into a flower or a butterfly if what the girls need is a mother. Can God be so cruel so as to deprive a young girl of her mother’s touch? And so reality turns into dream—or is it the other way around? And she is back again. Could Teresa still be alive? From the streets of Mexico City comes this heart-warming story of a young man struggling to raise his two daughters while working the night shift as a taxi driver.","popularity":0.2021,"poster_path":"/kNcnO8VaTEax2nZQgBukNBsYsz3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":299,"logo_path":"/elssmtHcogGtF8Gxokh9phZvLKi.png","name":"Instituto Mexicano de Cinematografía","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2011-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fly","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1303615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar Torres Lara","original_name":"Oscar Torres Lara","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Mosca","credit_id":"532df7b6c3a3685fe2002840","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1303616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mitzi Abril Torres Morales","original_name":"Mitzi Abril Torres Morales","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"532df7cac3a3685fcb0027cd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1303617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teresa Torres Morales","original_name":"Teresa Torres Morales","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"532df7dcc3a3685fac00272c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1303618,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teresa Morales Correa","original_name":"Teresa Morales Correa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"532df7f8c3a3685fcb0027d5","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1209325,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bulmaro Osornio","original_name":"Bulmaro Osornio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e1f9251416c7514c199","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1209325,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bulmaro Osornio","original_name":"Bulmaro Osornio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e1f9251416c7514c193","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1937253","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/kNcnO8VaTEax2nZQgBukNBsYsz3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1050}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11290,"name":"cab driver"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2011-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer, Mosca","key":"QE4eMk6p3kA","published_at":"2012-08-21T17:11:57.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec71dc3a368544800b3a1"}]}}}
