Rivers in the Dust: A Video Report by Bruce Honeywill.  In the 1990s one of the world's rarest desert river systems came under the threat of irrigated cotton agriculture. Cattle producers of Australia's Channel Country found allies in scientists and the attempts to develop irrigated agriculture were thwarted. This documentary looks at the background of the attempt to grow cotton on Cooper's Creek and how a wide spread community found a voice that the world listened to.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rivers in the Dust: Australia's Desert Rivers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Rivers in the Dust: Australia's Desert Rivers","key":"l6c7x7nLfug","published_at":"2013-02-25T20:26:23.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"533ec71cc3a368544800b377"}]}}}
