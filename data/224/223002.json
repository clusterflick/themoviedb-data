North American Watusi Tour was taped in Chicago, at a time when Mandell's comic style had still not completely jelled.

Running a rollicksome 52 minutes, Howie Mandell's North American Watusi Tour was first cablecast in 1986.","popularity":0.4463,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Howie Mandel: North American Watusi Tour","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Howie Mandel's North American Watusi Tour","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"On Location Howie Mandel","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Howie Mandel","original_name":"Howie Mandel","popularity":0.8958,"profile_path":"/lX5HyGJ6X6aVPwirx5Tt9CJcMzA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4e059251416c75148bc1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jerry Kramer","original_name":"Jerry Kramer","popularity":0.1357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e059251416c75148bc7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4696946","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
