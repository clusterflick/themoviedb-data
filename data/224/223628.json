He is living his life as an observer, governed by his senses. After 40 documentaries, and 20 years in chaotic Haiti - until the earthquake destroyed his home in 2010 - what is the meaning of such a life? Jorgen Leth is existentially driven between desire and despair, being always ready to seduce or to be seduced. The Seduced Human is a moral inquiry about the modern aesthetical position. Is the film maker's life without ethics?","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Det forførte menneske","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1209183,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Truls Lie","original_name":"Truls Lie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e1a9251416c7514b72b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2304593","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
