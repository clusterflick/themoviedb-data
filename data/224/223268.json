But before he can meet his watery doom, he is plucked up by the crew of the freighter \"The Ghost\". The ship's formidable captain, Wolf Larsen, sees a challenge in Humphrey; to turn this over educated idealist into a man of action like himself. Larsen succeeds in changing Humphrey's life, but in the process sacrifices himself to the same rage and instability that makes him such a powerful figure. In a gripping final confrontation, Humphrey must stop Wolf from destroying everything around him as he battles his own mortality. Based on the classic novel by Jack London.","popularity":1.1791,"poster_path":"/vgniHZNZcgARiqvUxgNhuUZvfg9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4688,"logo_path":null,"name":"Concorde-New Horizons","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sea Wolf","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stacy Keach","original_name":"Stacy Keach","popularity":1.6615,"profile_path":"/pxD1jmx9oAaV2lCLr87G3zRGv6i.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e0d9251416c75149db5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaason Simmons","original_name":"Jaason Simmons","popularity":0.2475,"profile_path":"/ia3R3PABNRHODvSoT617ONdy8kf.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e0d9251416c75149dbf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Davies","original_name":"Stephen Davies","popularity":0.3712,"profile_path":"/pPbgQ8uebicpySrw12TnRbnkIub.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"625d04e9ae36680050e18755","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mako","original_name":"Mako","popularity":0.6977,"profile_path":"/qrt9yI5sEEemzVAEh8mtI6E68L0.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"625d04f7d38b5817af9646b1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Dean","original_name":"Rick Dean","popularity":0.1246,"profile_path":"/ldosoFhbWDhJg4s5V1WoSrQRY5W.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"625d056ea284eb1439a3976c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3511980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"alejandra cruz","original_name":"alejandra cruz","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"625d05adcb3084317759a7f1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1945505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zaina Juliette","original_name":"Zaina Juliette","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/trgoXElpPQ74AqDAMWkKqrUPgbD.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"625d05bbdd731b00670addb1","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1136004,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gary T.
