With a voice-over she reflects upon his thoughts and how their atrociousness resonates through her daily life. Despite her unchanging incomprehension she seeks the limits of her empathy and tries to find ways to deal with such a loaded subject. As it proves to be impossible to make a connection she looks for something that does bind them. This brings her to the American landscape surrounding Death Valley, a place Thomas always wanted to visit. The filmmaker sends him fragments of quiet landscapes and memories that will never be his.","popularity":0.2972,"poster_path":"/qErkNkTWevizlyTn22kNuYdU7cO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113999,"logo_path":"/6H7TiOCd08UB1QAvSDUDi4ML8Ie.png","name":"Animal Tank","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":141722,"logo_path":null,"name":"De Imagerie","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Still from Afar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2014585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eva van Tongeren","original_name":"Eva van Tongeren","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac39e0192514160180741dc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2049190,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Cedric Vankerckhoven","original_name":"Cedric Vankerckhoven","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f840939798e060036cd7de4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1893885,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brecht Van Elslande","original_name":"Brecht Van Elslande","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f84095141465c003615872c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2812408,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Koen Bleuzé","original_name":"Koen Bleuzé","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8409602667780039c6612e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2014585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eva van Tongeren","original_name":"Eva van Tongeren","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8409705a46900038e91d46","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2432615,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Febe Simoens","original_name":"Febe Simoens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f84097ed8e15a003bf31eed","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2812409,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Els Viaene","original_name":"Els Viaene","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f84098f8258fc0036a10c0a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vvFQKS6F0GFKLmCuYNcTBC8DvVL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qErkNkTWevizlyTn22kNuYdU7cO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3664,"name":"research"},{"id":2883,"name":"imprisonment"},{"id":11161,"name":"paedophilia"},{"id":245654,"name":"pictures"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Courtisane Festival","release_date":"2018-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
