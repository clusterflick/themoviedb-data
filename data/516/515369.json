The film's plot develops along two planes. The first is life through the eyes of Soviet propaganda and the Donbas as a showcase of ideology. The second is real life, hidden from unwelcome eyes. The film uses archive footage and recordings of interviews with former Donbas residents who witnessed Russian aggression and became its victims. Life promised to become a symphony of work, joy and welfare, but turned out to be a delusion and a manipulation. Now there are no illusions left. The symphony of the Donbas has turned into a cacophony of the Donbas.","popularity":0.1713,"poster_path":"/hWh9mRauDvSyaMEXRDJmZZkeTtl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2018-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cacophony of the Donbas","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2012573,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yuri Leuta","original_name":"Yuri Leuta","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5abffaabc3a3684438035bf6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1353947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ihor Minayev","original_name":"Ihor Minayev","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5abffa8cc3a368443f0321dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9859814","wikidata_id":"Q109428577","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1969,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hWh9mRauDvSyaMEXRDJmZZkeTtl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1378}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-03-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"電影節","release_date":"2019-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Какофонія Донбасу | Тизер (трейлер) №1 (2018) | The Cacophony of Donbas","key":"yRJxwAeTU3M","published_at":"2017-12-21T10:53:24.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5abffa27c3a3684448037c27"}]}}}
