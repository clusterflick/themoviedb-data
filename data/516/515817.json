In the embattled provinces surrounding Kruger National Park, South Africa, a network of individuals risk their lives everyday to save the planet's last remaining black and white rhinos - including a Zulu bush tracker, the world’s largest private rhino owner, a frontline anti-poaching unit and a non-profit organisation striving to empower local communities. As poachers continue to destabilise their environment, VESTIGE investigates the gripping realities of human life and philosophy amid a disappearing species.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/styyWysUY5SX0FR7JPhn5T5SYRy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2019-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"This is not about them; it is about us as humans.","title":"Vestige","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2014374,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Halliday","original_name":"Mark Halliday","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac36e5c9251416015071020","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2014375,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Emma Hudson","original_name":"Emma Hudson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac36e6f9251412712033e4f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2014376,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Adam Shean","original_name":"Adam Shean","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac36e7e92514126be034248","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2014377,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sidney Tinney","original_name":"Sidney Tinney","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac36ee00e0a264a5707686d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8071620","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"Vestige.documentary","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kHgQYgirY5tcLg008TXVbsGuXON.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/styyWysUY5SX0FR7JPhn5T5SYRy.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Transitions Film Festival","release_date":"2019-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
