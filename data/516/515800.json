One girl talks about being home alone virtually all week; another’s sad because her parents are getting divorced. A boy in an asylum seekers’ center is worried about the future, while another boy doesn’t want to be gay and hopes these feelings will pass. Every day, the Kindertelefoon takes calls like these from children who want someone to talk to. But children also call to talk about their pets, to practice their audition for The Voice Kids or to make pranks. The recordings of these phone conversations are accompanied by images that quite literally give color to the conversations, and that beautifully reflect their tone—sometimes hilarious or naughty, but more often sad or heartrending.","popularity":0.3645,"poster_path":"/4bJYgkX98VkEHshHzsmJHGDZq0d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44926,"logo_path":null,"name":"Een van de Jongens","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2017-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Listen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1506657,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"tim van peppen","original_name":"tim van peppen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac3391ec3a368443f0703a5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1474760,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Riekje Ziengs","original_name":"Riekje Ziengs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac3392d0e0a264a4e075be4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":583128,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Astrid Bussink","original_name":"Astrid Bussink","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac339019251412712030111","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2014288,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sander Roeleveld","original_name":"Sander Roeleveld","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac33911c3a3682d35030547","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7145194","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4bJYgkX98VkEHshHzsmJHGDZq0d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3848,"name":"support"},{"id":6103,"name":"telephone"},{"id":237901,"name":"children's services"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
