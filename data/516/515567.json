Haunted by that history, and in the context of the recent rise of the far-right and the tragedy of Grenfell, Jay Bernardâ€™s film Something Said, and their award winning poetry both undertake a queer exploration of black British history, starting with this particular moment in time and examining its ramifications at two scales: the larger social and political rupture that followed the fire, and the smaller, individual attempt to reconcile one's queer present and the black radical past.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Something Said","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2013395,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jay Bernard","original_name":"Jay Bernard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5ac17ab8c3a3682d66013522","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2013395,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jay Bernard","original_name":"Jay Bernard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac17940c3a368444805761a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2013396,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tabitha Benjamin","original_name":"Tabitha Benjamin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac17a87c3a368443f05043e","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1966233,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jacqui Davies","original_name":"Jacqui Davies","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac17a7cc3a3682d350111cb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2013395,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jay Bernard","original_name":"Jay Bernard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac17ab10e0a260c39012569","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2013398,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Claire Kurylowski","original_name":"Claire Kurylowski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac17aa90e0a260c4d01173e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2013396,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tabitha Benjamin","original_name":"Tabitha Benjamin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac17a910e0a260c3901252f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2013397,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rufai Ajala","original_name":"Rufai Ajala","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac17a9b0e0a264a4e054b20","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
