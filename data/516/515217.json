Some are traumatized by their experience. Aware of the absurdity of their stories, they cry out for help. This documentary is an encounter with some of these men and women; ordinary people, sincere but lost, who tell the story of their extraordinary experiences. It is also the portrait of one amazing man: John E. Mack, a leading psychiatrist, Professor Emeritus at Harvard, 1997 Pulitzer Prize winner, and founder of the Department of Psychiatry at Cambridge Hospital. He has studied hundreds of similar cases, and explains in his book \"Abduction\" that what abducted people describe is real and that they are not suffering from any form of mental illness.","popularity":0.4172,"poster_path":"/oVL1PdSLdKQDQ9ewgbPUTepbJOf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abducted","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Experiencers","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1691776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stéphane Allix","original_name":"Stéphane Allix","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Host","credit_id":"5abec730c3a368445501bc1c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1235989,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dr. John E.
