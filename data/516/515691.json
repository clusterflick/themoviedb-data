At night, I wander through the streets, in search of resemblances, in the faces and the bodies of others. For whom do I close my eyes at night? A phantom image, a single face that is not there. I show a world that is not mine, that is not real. The image carries my words, words that are eroded. What can I tell, close to the places that I do not show you?” (MC)","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un Seul Visage (Some came here to hide)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2013711,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mieriën Coppens","original_name":"Mieriën Coppens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac25ecfc3a3684448067c17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
