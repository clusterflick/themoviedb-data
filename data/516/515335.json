Steve opens his heart as he tells of childhood ridicule in the 50's, coming out and living openly gay during the decades of the 60s to the 80s- a period rife with homophobia- finding true love, dealing with tragedy and loss, loneliness and aging. His gradual evolution includes embracing sobriety, connecting with a long lost relative and discovering his spirituality only to find that he is in danger of losing his home and business. His entertaining reflections stimulate argument and offer us a refreshing appreciation of life, love and living.","popularity":0.0459,"poster_path":"/3adQ9fHNOi9VDgMkQ1mV9PddDN3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Not a Still Life","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1794292,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roberta Cantow","original_name":"Roberta Cantow","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/kS9Cwaj8GnHO5iOFElkYZVb78A2.jpg","credit_id":"5abfbc37925141602702cb8d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2570228","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3adQ9fHNOi9VDgMkQ1mV9PddDN3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
