A woman searches an inner landscape, a space that closes it up and encloses it. Her dress, a projection of femininity, becomes her means of expression. The film silently moves to the point of confrontation by means of rhythmic editing; the woman opens the door to the outside world. This shocking moment of violent interaction is reinforced by the only sound in the film.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/5McgEbh5INghp9FOz1etXowEwOb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chameleon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2013495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tanya Syed","original_name":"Tanya Syed","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac1da1b92514126c10168ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8090686","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1299,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5McgEbh5INghp9FOz1etXowEwOb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":866}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
