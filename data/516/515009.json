The 95-year-old lady has turned her house into a castle, hiding the open wounds of a prominent Mexican upper class family behind its stone walls. When José Pablo went abroad to study film, Mamacita made him promise to return to Mexico one day to make a film about her life. He conquers his granny's empire like a Trojan horse, discovering the haunted spirits of his own past and the lack of love that his entire clan has suffered from for generations.","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":"/5hTcKZtbtu061p69zIr4AKtZ8Pj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128070,"logo_path":null,"name":"Plátano Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2018-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mamacita","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2010884,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jose Pablo Estrada Torrescano","original_name":"Jose Pablo Estrada Torrescano","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5abd60c20e0a2609d503327c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7389878","wikidata_id":"Q63991758","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kkZGjUV97UqxMryN15MC0OGpW2n.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5hTcKZtbtu061p69zIr4AKtZ8Pj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":707},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/cz6LLC2hsn4nsJRptJIfFv1cDpg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":810}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"AA","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
