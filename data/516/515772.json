They form an atomic time bomb, even if official Russian authorities stubbornly deny an acute danger.","popularity":0.3363,"poster_path":"/cWrTyzDzC1Qn05SSUQFQIgxpt9a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99085,"logo_path":null,"name":"SWR/Arte","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2013-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Atomfriedhof Arktis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2014184,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Christian Saal","original_name":"Christian Saal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac2df3f0e0a260c3902b674","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Technician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1169993,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Reutter","original_name":"Thomas Reutter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac2de9ec3a3682d33028779","department":"Writing","job":"Author"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2014194,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ulrike Vogel","original_name":"Ulrike Vogel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac2e0a60e0a260c01027b42","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2014182,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Thomas Schäfer","original_name":"Thomas Schäfer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac2df0c0e0a260c4a02cd14","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Technician"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2014200,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alexander Struck","original_name":"Alexander Struck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac2e1440e0a260c2a02d329","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1742895,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christoph Schauer","original_name":"Christoph Schauer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac2e1130e0a260c2a02d2ea","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j5QethFs8b8BGhDLv3iNVHmJWKR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cWrTyzDzC1Qn05SSUQFQIgxpt9a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":8721,"name":"arctic polar circle region"},{"id":179855,"name":"atomic device"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"arte","release_date":"2013-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2013-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
