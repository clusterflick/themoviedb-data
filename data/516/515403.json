But ten-year-old Anni is not allowed to go to school. Why? Her father is a dissident.  Anni and her father moved to be closer to her older sister. The little girl was not in her new school long enough to get settled – the secret police took her away after three days. Her father was, as so many times before, being interrogated. The school preferred to not have anything to do with such a family, so they have refused to continue educating her. Independent Chinese director Zhu Rikun, camera in hand, follows the movement of activists who have joined forces through the Weibo social network to support Anni. Will peaceful protests in front of the school and a petition be enough to pressure the school to take her back?","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/nijtxermrmy2Rcjb3nTKMIFWRhj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50929,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fanhall Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2018-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anni","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1177421,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rikun Zhu","original_name":"Rikun Zhu","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/b5u66TDbbEIcn5hcXzvgydh4qqc.jpg","credit_id":"5ac06983925141602103ad62","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1177421,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rikun Zhu","original_name":"Rikun Zhu","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/b5u66TDbbEIcn5hcXzvgydh4qqc.jpg","credit_id":"5b7cdfcdc3a36859090063dc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1177421,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rikun Zhu","original_name":"Rikun Zhu","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/b5u66TDbbEIcn5hcXzvgydh4qqc.jpg","credit_id":"5f1e1fc2511d0900357596ee","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8223320","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nijtxermrmy2Rcjb3nTKMIFWRhj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1437}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"One World FF","release_date":"2018-03-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
