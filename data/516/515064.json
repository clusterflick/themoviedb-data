The three friends are in love with three pretty girls in Toulon: Honoré is in love with Mireille who, as for her, loves Antonin, and Papillote only has eyes for Angèle who, after a fifteen-month-long cruise,presents him a newborn baby that she claims is their son! A new woman appears: Patricia, as sexy as she is mysterious. Antonin, although disconcerted, falls under her spell. What he does not know is that Patricia is not a journalist as she says she is but a secret service agent who has been assigned the mission to investigate Eric Bergen, a shady fellow the trio meets everyday at Arsène's Café.","popularity":0.2706,"poster_path":"/4kgR11jR0HYPWeMpKmT7s9VKzVx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73783,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cocinex","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":88323,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les
