Both men are ordered to give close protection to Siegfried, a suspected murderer. Wagner lives in an old fashioned apartment, he counts birds, listens to Richard Wagner's operas, sees a lot, does little, meets a woman, gets entangled - and in the end he loses his countenance. A story about good-wanting and wrong-doing, about relationships and people in contemporary Berlin.","popularity":0.1983,"poster_path":"/owfTFIVmaDCxdKwv9R4Kg12XXMJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2011-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Before Tomorrow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1420239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Axel Buchholz","original_name":"Axel Buchholz","popularity":0.0987,"profile_path":"/zbl2n1eOcYlHHE8bcIrSWiVky5M.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Wagner","credit_id":"5bc9ce100e0a260fca00dc67","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1663826,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Axel Sichrovsky","original_name":"Axel Sichrovsky","popularity":0.0523,"profile_path":"/t3bMFF7mtkAVljshecCKXcMHWRT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Zippolt","credit_id":"5bc9ce18925141562700d703","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":17824,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Regine Zimmermann","original_name":"Regine Zimmermann","popularity":0.0927,"profile_path":"/gt08gkE1HDbkIAvnTEqTgeP6Pyl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Corinna","credit_id":"5bc9ce21925141561d00d5c7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67423,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christoph Grunert","original_name":"Christoph Grunert","popularity":0.1866,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Siegfried","credit_id":"5bc9ce29925141562100d39f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1381042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Kretschmar","original_name":"Ralph Kretschmar","popularity":0.0878,"profile_path":"/mp0hw8YDDSLav7JJghWVMliS1dW.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Karlos","credit_id":"5c3d1f590e0a2654c18e30c9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1290278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthias Rott","original_name":"Matthias Rott","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Fahrer","credit_id":"5c3d1f640e0a2654c18e3124","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":40366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatja Seibt","original_name":"Tatja Seibt","popularity":0.1558,"profile_path":"/zDmeDfNT7hHcTGmRNpTTQDgRrBv.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Tante","credit_id":"5c3d1f6f0e0a2654c18e3128","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1054360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joachim Schoenfeld","original_name":"Joachim Schoenfeld","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc9cdff925141561d00d5a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1924462","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1450,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/owfTFIVmaDCxdKwv9R4Kg12XXMJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1024}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
