In the film we meet Josef, a young Afro-Swede in high school who, during a lesson, ends up in a dream world where he travels in time and meets people who contributed to the perception of racism in Sweden. The film addresses the consequences of his journey when racist classmates decide to take revenge as his new-found knowledge is seen a betrayal of the Sweden they know. The film also depicts how ethnic Swedes have been subjected to racism as well as how people in Sweden have worked against racism. The film is unique in addressing the less known parts of Swedish history. The main purpose is to demonstrate that it is possible to stop hate crimes through increased knowledge and that it is up to the individual to stand up for what is right.","popularity":0.3825,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":110171,"logo_path":null,"name":"Muzicadelic Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":110172,"logo_path":null,"name":"Clash Film","origin_country":""},{"id":77440,"logo_path":"/dCT5rOH3IEAFHQk6LVpfsG29eUg.png","name":"Film i V채sterbotten","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We are like Oranges","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2151259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kari Berg","original_name":"Kari Berg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Sara","credit_id":"5bc500ca0e0a266e6b066add","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2151260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jesper Eriksson","original_name":"Jesper Eriksson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Josef","credit_id":"5bc500f4c3a3682d59062783","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2151261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Tjernlund","original_name":"Tim Tjernlund","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Peter","credit_id":"5bc501120e0a266e680673aa","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2151252,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joachim Ljungquist","original_name":"Joachim Ljungquist","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc500630e0a266e5706b2d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2151254,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cecilia Garding","original_name":"Cecilia Garding","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc500770e0a266e68067326","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2151254,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cecilia Garding","original_name":"Cecilia Garding","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc500820e0a266e5706b2f0","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2151256,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mike Haines G채rding","original_name":"Mike Haines G채rding","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc5009692514179ca062484","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3894914","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12425,"name":"racism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
