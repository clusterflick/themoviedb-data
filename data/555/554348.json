Is it possible for a Knight of the Holy Grail to look more enticing than Peter Hofmann? No wonder Elsa (Eva Marton) falls in love at first sight. Marton’s heroine is innocent, but she is also a passionate, real-life young woman—which is good, because Leonie Rysanek is positively demented as Ortrud, the sorceress who accuses Elsa and Lohengrin of using magic. With James Levine’s superb conducting, the orchestra and chorus are similarly magical.","popularity":0.3533,"poster_path":"/dQtDm9HBPiYrRrC7IreWj4YKzYj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15005,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Metropolitan Opera","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1986-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":223,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lohengrin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1160671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Hofmann","original_name":"Peter Hofmann","popularity":0.1416,"profile_path":"/wI1TGlpZHbozB4cIF8OYQhOal51.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lohengrin","credit_id":"5bc5a1e692514179c406aba9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1045487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Éva Marton","original_name":"Éva Marton","popularity":0.1421,"profile_path":"/5KvVYcoNhvzI9qD1T7U7WmaClsD.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Elsa","credit_id":"5bc5a1c8c3a3682d4707b88a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1315097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonie Rysanek","original_name":"Leonie Rysanek","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/qmHCNhrvcWpB1tJX3FBzCBQyhjG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ortrud","credit_id":"5bc5a1ce0e0a266e6b071aa7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1832303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leif Roar","original_name":"Leif Roar","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Telramund","credit_id":"5bc5a1de0e0a266e570764d9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1683475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Raffell","original_name":"Anthony Raffell","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"The King's Herald","credit_id":"5ec480879979d2001f32446b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":233462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Macurdy","original_name":"John Macurdy","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"King Henry","credit_id":"5bc5a1d792514179ba070358","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":190825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Anthony","original_name":"Charles Anthony","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"First noble","credit_id":"5ec56a26e635710022cc616f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1564263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Gilmore","original_name":"John Gilmore","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Second noble","credit_id":"5ec56a39cb75d1002127e1ca","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1564237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Darrenkamp","original_name":"John Darrenkamp","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Third noble","credit_id":"5ec56a4fe635710020cbb680","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1116830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Vernon","original_name":"Richard Vernon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Fourth noble","credit_id":"5ec56a69ae281100203a04d6","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2646466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Collins","original_name":"Christian Collins","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Gottfried","credit_id":"5ec56b06140bad001b16e08d","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2923063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"MET Orchestra","original_name":"MET Orchestra","popularity":0.0984,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":25,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff924ab1c0435003dbaef7c","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1248678,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"James Levine","original_name":"James Levine","popularity":0.1985,"profile_path":"/p6ujBSZMKTc2zNCytIvvg9NKL1D.jpg","credit_id":"5bc5a1f10e0a2613b0012062","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113689,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian Large","original_name":"Brian Large","popularity":0.137,"profile_path":"/fwMu0qHur53enoBapRcjpKw7Ydq.jpg","credit_id":"5ec54d57d2147c0022b808a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2646311,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ming Cho Lee","original_name":"Ming Cho Lee","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec54f24ae2811001e3a0cc5","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1037378,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Peter J.
