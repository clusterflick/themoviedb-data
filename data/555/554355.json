He understood how to combine Shakespeare’s rich characterization and Verdi’s dramatic music to create an overwhelming figure, one whose death left audiences deeply shaken. Vickers is perfectly partnered by James Levine’s conducting and the Met’s sensational orchestra and chorus. Renata Scotto is an appealing Desdemona, Cornell MacNeil is a menacing Iago, and Franco Zeffirelli’s production is deservedly legendary.","popularity":0.1361,"poster_path":"/eEeNnrlrEMl0AUGSL9XcwhXR4oS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Otello - The Met","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Vickers","original_name":"Jon Vickers","popularity":0.0695,"profile_path":"/kAvC40omRqJSfAKXvRhUAalwhqp.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5bc5a701c3a3681109001ec8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1314764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renata Scotto","original_name":"Renata Scotto","popularity":0.0852,"profile_path":"/sgtzKPSIxOBITL9WLz5j7tjlse0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5bc5a7089251414467011a3d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cornell MacNeil","original_name":"Cornell MacNeil","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/r3kK1M40aoCg21q8GWMik6EmaHF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5bc5a70e92514179c406afa7","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1248678,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"James Levine","original_name":"James Levine","popularity":0.1985,"profile_path":"/p6ujBSZMKTc2zNCytIvvg9NKL1D.jpg","credit_id":"5bc5a71b0e0a266e5707695e","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1792,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6yAeRmK4aTbJPnRo71SUvxfJSY6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3185}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2137,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eEeNnrlrEMl0AUGSL9XcwhXR4oS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1425}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
