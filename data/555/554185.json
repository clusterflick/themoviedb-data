Mankind encloses to time its marks, stains and ruins. On the verge of vast changes time acts abnormally. It leaks, folds and fractures, allowing things belonging elsewhere, to the otherworldly, to permeate itself. In the 8mm film the Helsinki Olympic Stadium represents a historical paradigm shift. Completed in 1938 the building outlines pure functionalist architecture and stands as a landmark for optimistic utopia and the oblivion on man’s neglect of history.","popularity":0.2273,"poster_path":"/icIgLjsz6naFnTip6DRjUR3C2QR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2017-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amplifier","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2151066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heikki Vienola","original_name":"Heikki Vienola","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5bc4b87bc3a3682d5b064c55","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1512665,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Heikki Kossi","original_name":"Heikki Kossi","popularity":0.1537,"profile_path":"/6VipnMFz9whg3WKRGld7KJDGTlo.jpg","credit_id":"6440268f95665804de0207f1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2151059,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saara Ekström","original_name":"Saara Ekström","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc4b759c3a3682d47069fd4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1512666,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pietu Korhonen","original_name":"Pietu Korhonen","popularity":0.0685,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc4b77c92514179c405af84","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1488315,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Eero Tammi","original_name":"Eero Tammi","popularity":0.0669,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc4b78e0e0a266e6b06087a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2151059,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saara Ekström","original_name":"Saara Ekström","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc4bb690e0a266e680610ed","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2151059,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saara Ekström","original_name":"Saara Ekström","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc4bb7ec3a3682d4b066d27","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2151059,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saara Ekström","original_name":"Saara Ekström","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc4bb8e0e0a2613b00017bd","department":"Writing","job":"Author"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8112522","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1596,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/icIgLjsz6naFnTip6DRjUR3C2QR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1064}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3667,"name":"time"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fi","note":"","release_date":"2017-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fi","note":"","release_date":"2018-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
