The title's literal translation is \"The Spanish Hour\", but here the word \"heure\" refers more generally to \"time\", reminiscent of the cliché, \"How They Keep Time in Spain\". The work's Latin atmosphere is reinforced through Ravel's incorporation of dance music like the malagueña, the jota, and the habañera.","popularity":0.1318,"poster_path":"/xqxpAWynDcowEdknENgJj0EtmMn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'heure espagnole","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2153514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elliot Madore","original_name":"Elliot Madore","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5bc871cac3a36829d3016ef4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1563742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"François Piolino","original_name":"François Piolino","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5bc871d1c3a36829bf017e0a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2153516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stéphanie d’Oustrac","original_name":"Stéphanie d’Oustrac","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5bc871d7c3a36829bf017e1e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1709008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alek Shrader","original_name":"Alek Shrader","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5bc871de0e0a263639015904","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":206917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Gay","original_name":"Paul Gay","popularity":0.0811,"profile_path":"/9YJ3dAW5pa8sV4VFKgKsIIO073v.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5bc871e7c3a36829d00169e6","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1676,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xqxpAWynDcowEdknENgJj0EtmMn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1117}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
