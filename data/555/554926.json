The young man's dauntingly routine everyday life is interrupted when his mother takes Tomi to town to celebrate his 23rd birthday. Tomi, who makes laconically analytical observations in his mind, is forced by a new situation to face his own feelings and prejudices about the world. Is life just a total misery, or is it not, after all? Perhaps the twisted world straightens out if you look at it from an even more twisted angle.","popularity":0.3495,"poster_path":"/rMQNyXtG9o5msQsCuwKy61NYtj7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vihainen marsu","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paavo Kinnunen","original_name":"Paavo Kinnunen","popularity":0.1083,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Tomi","credit_id":"5bc951cb0e0a260fbf006277","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":11070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Outi Mäenpää","original_name":"Outi Mäenpää","popularity":0.1703,"profile_path":"/tz3h8JO4O8m5RhVFaCMsTPJgOHa.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"61ebd11fe48860006db88dc4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1426721,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bahar Tokat","original_name":"Bahar Tokat","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sales person","credit_id":"61ebcfdecd204600923384d9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2434921,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leena Vanhamäki","original_name":"Leena Vanhamäki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mother's friend","credit_id":"61ebcfe69ca759009776535c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93002,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Petri Kotwica","original_name":"Petri Kotwica","popularity":0.1261,"profile_path":"/spcAKLzf5h3QTPlcmROAFzkG9se.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Therapist","credit_id":"61ebcff34df291001ba133b1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1102475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tero Salenius","original_name":"Tero Salenius","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":"/3JOWWsIquUWhfjaOj5erfjfQ4e.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Man in therapy","credit_id":"61ebcffbc669ad0058f294db","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1814778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iida-Maria Heinonen","original_name":"Iida-Maria Heinonen","popularity":0.1166,"profile_path":"/z3VQwvvdR7CK6gbZK2rfJIB390e.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Waiter","credit_id":"61ebd003e48860006db88d14","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2247257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilkka Pekkarinen","original_name":"Ilkka Pekkarinen","popularity":0.1036,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Unto","credit_id":"61ebd00b4df29100b5fc370a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2543854,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joni Koivuniemi","original_name":"Joni Koivuniemi","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Enska","credit_id":"61ebd0121ad93b009ab3b960","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1454140,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tapio Liukkonen","original_name":"Tapio Liukkonen","popularity":0.0861,"profile_path":"/u4GIvS9DZzrB83VrXMF81vbU6KO.jpg","credit_id":"6474bceebe2d4900dcdbb30b","department":"Sound","job":"Foley Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1113222,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antti Heikki Pesonen","original_name":"Antti Heikki Pesonen","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc951f50e0a260fcc00610e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6316494","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pWQVhIv6QGqFFzFAl9P7vakQatC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rMQNyXtG9o5msQsCuwKy61NYtj7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fi","note":"","release_date":"2017-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
