It consists of 6 models at scale 1, reduced dimensions, custom-built for the artist's size and build. These are simple geometric shapes, covered in white plaster or paint, which make no claim to any particular function. These white houses, immaculate and asexual, invite their unique protagonist, Absalon, to isolation and introspection.","popularity":0.2023,"poster_path":"/ba84JcYGKABYiGXqUjqcD586eXI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Proposal for Habitacle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2151923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Absalon","original_name":"Absalon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5bc5f887925141620c01c161","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2151923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Absalon","original_name":"Absalon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc5f8a10e0a266e5b07cd16","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1726,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ba84JcYGKABYiGXqUjqcD586eXI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1151}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":166676,"name":"contemporary art"},{"id":248307,"name":"instalation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Collection Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris ","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
