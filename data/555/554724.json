Amidst exotic, fanciful settings and cruel trials to conquer knowledge, amidst musical enchantment and threatening hostile forces, is the final victory of good over evil and love over hate. Singspiel in two acts to a libretto by Emanuel Schikaneder, the Zauberflöte is one of the Salzburg genius’ last masterpieces, which he probably began composing in May 1791, not even six months before his death. The opera had its debut in Vienna on 30 September 1791, conducted by the composer himself and with Schikaneder as Papageno.","popularity":0.3131,"poster_path":"/eJE5YyOj4lZS6sX4ejRzWyIOnCZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32404,"logo_path":null,"name":"Teatro la Fenice","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2015-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":148,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Magical flute at the Fenice","title":"Mozart: Die Zauberflöte","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1576825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Poli","original_name":"Antonio Poli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Tamino","credit_id":"5bc7c0ca0e0a263627009af2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2153176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ekaterina Sadovnikova","original_name":"Ekaterina Sadovnikova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Pamina","credit_id":"5bc7c0e192514109e600900b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1154138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Esposito","original_name":"Alex Esposito","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/AbAWMb7rgmwwfaBSpztz5tNYsu4.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Papageno","credit_id":"5bc7c0f292514109e600901b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Goran Juric","original_name":"Goran Juric","popularity":0.0553,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Sarastro","credit_id":"5bc7c0fec3a36829c80091f5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2153179,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Pudova","original_name":"Olga Pudova","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"The Queen of the Night","credit_id":"5bc7c10fc3a36829c8009206","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1574996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caterina Di Tonno","original_name":"Caterina Di Tonno","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/1o0gjF9XsJvg6sLfeCnpFRMSWlv.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Papagena","credit_id":"5bc7c11ec3a36829c200a6a6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2153171,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antonello Manacorda","original_name":"Antonello Manacorda","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5bc7c13d92514109f6008f2e","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18170,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","original_name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":"/p4ueHlbsBraC1AMAGDCYJJ5L9cw.jpg","credit_id":"5bc7c01c92514109e6008f4c","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2153171,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antonello Manacorda","original_name":"Antonello Manacorda","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc7c03c0e0a2636390099e2","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1572397,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Damiano Michieletto","original_name":"Damiano Michieletto","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc7c049c3a36829e2008bf7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2153172,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Paolo Fantin","original_name":"Paolo Fantin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc7c0590e0a26364000984e","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2153173,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Carla Teti","original_name":"Carla Teti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc7c06e0e0a263635009e03","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1114712,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emanuel Schikaneder","original_name":"Emanuel Schikaneder","popularity":0.1008,"profile_path":"/2eUopISvCaVewhhEcqqtDxYdoQE.jpg","credit_id":"5bc7c0929251410a060091c5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2153175,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Foulon","original_name":"Nicolas Foulon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc7c0abc3a36829d000ac45","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":971,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eJE5YyOj4lZS6sX4ejRzWyIOnCZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":647}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
