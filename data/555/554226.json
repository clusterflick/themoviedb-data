To give you the good oil, the movie follows the simplistic travels of two surfers, meeting friends along the way, on an open ended journey across an archipelago littered with islands and breaks. Connected by ribbons of tarmac and separated by deep ocean valleys these islands have been here for millennia and will continue to do so for millennia to come. An veritable eden for waves of every nature, from long reeling glassy points breaks to sketchy urchin infested waves in the middle of nowhere.","popularity":0.1849,"poster_path":"/huU9fRFcT6yLq1BIzYs8rp0EHLR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Had Too Much To Dream Last Night","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1282118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harrison Roach","original_name":"Harrison Roach","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5bc4f53bc3a3682d4e0628db","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1738490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Cuddihy","original_name":"Matt Cuddihy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5bc4f5459251414467006d79","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1738491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zye Norris","original_name":"Zye Norris","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5bc4f5500e0a266e68066802","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1738492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Husni Ridhwan","original_name":"Husni Ridhwan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5bc4f5609251414467006d96","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2151213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deni Fridaus","original_name":"Deni Fridaus","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5bc4f570c3a3682d4406ca32","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1738497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tai Graham","original_name":"Tai Graham","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5bc4f577c3a3682d4b06c214","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2151214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryce Young","original_name":"Bryce Young","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5bc4f5890e0a266e6806683e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2151215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelana Humphrey","original_name":"Kelana Humphrey","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5bc4f5ba925141620c00a671","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1738488,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dustin Humphrey","original_name":"Dustin Humphrey","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc4f45f0e0a266e54065edb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2151205,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andre Cricket","original_name":"Andre Cricket","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc4f4950e0a266e6b066088","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1826301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David John Schaap","original_name":"David John Schaap","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/56wCKMXZh6hsqUubkaBFt2LafCj.jpg","credit_id":"5bc4f4aa0e0a266e5706a6c3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2151209,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Lincoln Caplice","original_name":"Lincoln Caplice","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc4f4cb92514179ba064ef4","department":"Art","job":"Creative Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1738489,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anthony Dodds","original_name":"Anthony Dodds","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc4f47492514179b606135e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1738489,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anthony Dodds","original_name":"Anthony Dodds","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc4f4f492514179c10605ed","department":"Camera","job":"Still Photographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2151212,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Woody Gooch","original_name":"Woody Gooch","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc4f5000e0a266e64069f31","department":"Camera","job":"Still Photographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1969,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/huU9fRFcT6yLq1BIzYs8rp0EHLR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1392}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
