Inspired by the short films of Maya Deren, Curtis Harrington and the art of Rosaleen Norton and Brett Whiteley, 'Love and the Demonic Psyche' channels French poet Arthur Rimbaud's proclivity for a derangement of the senses, culminating in a Cocteau style blood painting invocating the horned God of Panic. Encompassed in psychedelic visuals and Moroccan trance music, this film should be viewed in the spirit in which it was made.","popularity":0.2953,"poster_path":"/uCIC16eyywyZMrPADt9iYhG9KWY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2018-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love and the Demonic Psyche","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2141150,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Liam Clark","original_name":"Liam Clark","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Poet","credit_id":"5bc58b8e0e0a266e6b0704ee","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2151552,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Di Maria","original_name":"Amanda Di Maria","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Syrinx","credit_id":"5bc58bb292514179b606a71f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2151553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jordan Cross","original_name":"Jordan Cross","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Pan","credit_id":"5bc58bc392514179c40696e8","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2141153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Von Bock","original_name":"Sarah Von Bock","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc591a60e0a266e6b070aa6","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2141150,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Liam Clark","original_name":"Liam Clark","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc5923cc3a3682d53069764","department":"Sound","job":"Music Sound Design and Processing"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2141150,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Liam Clark","original_name":"Liam Clark","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc5911e0e0a266e6b070a38","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2151553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jordan Cross","original_name":"Jordan Cross","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc591b8925141620c014892","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2141151,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"James Winthrop","original_name":"James Winthrop","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc5913992514179ba06f266","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2141150,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Liam Clark","original_name":"Liam Clark","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc5924e92514179ba06f36f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2141150,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Liam Clark","original_name":"Liam Clark","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc590dbc3a3682d44077300","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2151567,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariah Arvanitakis","original_name":"Mariah Arvanitakis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc5917bc3a3682d4407739a","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2151568,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Kenny Ray Earl","original_name":"Kenny Ray Earl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc591d10e0a263eb30009db","department":"Lighting","job":"Gaffer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":"Q116743557","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"brutalistromanticism","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2667,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uCIC16eyywyZMrPADt9iYhG9KWY.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lMS8PqUw1SMs83zuyyiGaRqqBV1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":810}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5275,"name":"pan"},{"id":3298,"name":"hallucination"},{"id":9887,"name":"surrealism"},{"id":2036,"name":"greek mythology"},{"id":14964,"name":"drugs"},{"id":41308,"name":"syringe"},{"id":184392,"name":"psychedelic"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"R18+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
