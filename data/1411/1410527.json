Though they find caring for plants easier than caring for themselves, an elder wise woman, Tia Silvia, constantly checks in on them and helps them on their journey. Every night Polo has the same dream: that theyâ€™re slowly turning into a being made of plants. Green Castles, the first collaboration between Anto(n) Astudillo and Kelley Van Dilla, represents a deepening of friendship through exploration of shared synchronicities in their lived experiences as trans and queer filmmakers. Anto(n) and Kelley also collaborate in building trans+ community, and healing care-centred filmmaking environments.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Green Castles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5152044,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anto(n) Astudillo","original_name":"Anto(n) Astudillo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6775306e194b5816d761350c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5152047,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kelley Van Dilla","original_name":"Kelley Van Dilla","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677530a398f2f82fc492b68d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"TILDE Film Festival","release_date":"2024-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
