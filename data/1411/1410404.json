Six soldiers- five men and one woman- are trained in special tactics to fight without fear in important operations. The group is called the SUICIDE FORCE. Capt. Samson (EDDIE GARCIA) heads the group. He treats his men not only as his buddies, but as members of his family. One of the group's deadliest assignments is a kidnap-rescue. They are called by Gen. Cruz (LITO LEGASPI) to rescue his daughter Sheila (Maricar De Mesa) from the terrorist master Abdul Malic (DENNIS ROLDAN), who runs an international kidnap-for-ransom group that targets diplomats. The group bravely accepts the assignment, but they are plagued with doubts. Will they survive the operation and live to see their loved ones again? A story of bravery, love, and sacrifice, Terrorist Hunter is a timely, gripping action spectacle with enough surprises and twists to keep you on the edge of your seat well into the night.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Terrorist Hunter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0494867","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-12-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
