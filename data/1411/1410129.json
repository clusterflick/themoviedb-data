ABOVE ALL is a revealing short documentary about the life of an American man who ended up onboard with an atomic bomb, in the midst of the 1962 Cuban Crisis. The world was never been closer to nuclear war than this moment.  A surprisingly heart-warming story told with his own words and pictures, the film is made from family home movies, including previously unseen footage from inside the US airbases. This film juxtaposes love, family and war through the arc of one manâ€™s life.  As President Kennedy addressed the world in a live televised speech of extraordinary gravity, we glimpse at the true psychology of what is was like to be in the air in those infamous moments, whilst the very essence of life on Earth was on the line.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"We were 15 minutes from the end of the world.","title":"Above All","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
