Between Avatar's giant gravitonic rings, each of which carries the crushing force of a captive black hole, and her monstrous microwave emitting battle cylinders, the combined forces of the world's nations don't stand a chance... but Avatar is mistaken in her belief that her forces are unbeatable. Standing against them is a single amazing ship, the Ra, a Yamato-class battle sub secretly rebuilt after its supposed destruction in World War II by a handful of dedicated warriors who now claim allegiance to no country. Joining them are the mysterious Annette, descendant of a lost civilization, and Go Arisaka, the sole survivor of a vanquished UN Peacekeeping Force who must find a way to work with his estranged father, once missing and presumed dead and now the captain of the Ra.","popularity":2.2708,"poster_path":"/zISUQgSDSifJpfGemGP7GJHMhSe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":241564,"logo_path":null,"name":"Toho Video","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":248837,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kaitei Gunkan Seisaku Iinkai","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1996-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Invaders struck first..
