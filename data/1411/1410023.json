Capturing chaotic scenes of city life and personal moments of quiet reflection, Gilden has amassed a life's work that exists at the cross-section of portraiture and documentation. Recently known for his stark portraits in digital color (after using black and white photography for most of his career), Gilden effortlessly captures the depth of his subjects' complex emotions, often only in the time it takes to click his shutter while passing by. Gilden refers to these subjects as \"characters\", belying the way he can tell layered stories in a single image.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"It has nothing to do with the flash, darlings.","title":"Bruce Gilden: Why These?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5150644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Gilden","original_name":"Bruce Gilden","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67738cdd4111599e3812a363","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5150648,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Olita","original_name":"Ivan Olita","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67738d045f1c4fa47361911b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5150649,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Steve Mastorelli","original_name":"Steve Mastorelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67738d2c98f2f82fc4929197","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
