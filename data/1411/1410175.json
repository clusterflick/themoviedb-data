Ramona (Bella Lochmann) and Nico (Pola Geiger) are friends, lazy bums and fresh out of school. But instead of thinking about their future, they prefer to let the hot Berlin summer get the better of them. When they release a beloved neighbor's bird, they have to flee - into the politically charged world that they really don't want to be in. A road trip through Berlin begins - but on foot. On their aimless and half-hearted search for the escaped bird and their little brother, they struggle for their friendship, their belief in themselves and unexpectedly stumble upon other life stories that give hope.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/tz3QU3HHK1y3opqpxuP7NgrMkvy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31052,"logo_path":"/pJgQoO1PyJdhOP1UOrVsDeolYw7.png","name":"Deutsche Film- und Fernsehakademie Berlin (DFFB)","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2025-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nulpen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3053600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pola Geiger","original_name":"Pola Geiger","popularity":0.0887,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Nico","credit_id":"677410a9d8dc22e6c692ab0b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5199912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bella Lochmann","original_name":"Bella Lochmann","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ramona","credit_id":"679345d5ee91427631483a1a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5199913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rio Kirchner","original_name":"Rio Kirchner","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Noah","credit_id":"679345e6ee91427631483a35","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5151029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sorina Gajewski","original_name":"Sorina Gajewski","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677411105f1c4fa47361a157","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5151029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sorina Gajewski","original_name":"Sorina Gajewski","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677411205f1c4fa47361a15f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1997235,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Hannes Schulze","original_name":"Hannes Schulze","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67934612559e2d974b482e4b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4287974,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sabrina Holzapfel","original_name":"Sabrina Holzapfel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67934621c5081346f1483334","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5199916,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Raffaello Lupperger","original_name":"Raffaello Lupperger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6793463c0a30d6d059238ed3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35149269","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2828,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tz3QU3HHK1y3opqpxuP7NgrMkvy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"46.
