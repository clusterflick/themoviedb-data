She owes her success to her discerning observation of the human condition. In Cada respire, the artist is stretched out on the grass by the seaside. As the camera gradually moves away from her, a flower detaches itself from the pattern of her dress and grows up to the rhythm of her breathing. Drawing inspiration from Flavio Garciandia’s masterpiece All You Need is Love (1975) – itself a reminder of Fidel Castro’s ban against playing Beatles’ music on the island – León pays tribute here to a generation of artists who had the courage to take action, but she empties this reference of its political content in order to praise its formal beauty; we all breathe the same air.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":"/eVPb2FaQtzkPhLPQQZlbKtJoaq5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Every Breath","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Every Breath","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Chaque Souffle","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CU","title":"Cada Respiro","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2300611,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Glenda Leon","original_name":"Glenda Leon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67772335ab5ec4c3dc7242ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1519,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qEqoucQg0Xn8J0oMAr4qVptocFV.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2700}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eVPb2FaQtzkPhLPQQZlbKtJoaq5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
