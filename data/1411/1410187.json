Giolo subverts the usual representation of mountain communities to deliver a portrait of a precious cultural heritage in constant evolution. Here, the inhabitants preserve and nurture their culture for future generations with awareness of the world and creativity. Shot on 16mm film sensitive to the grandeur and fragility of nature, Memory Is an Animal, It Barks with Many Mouths is an exquisite essay on the vital importance of linguistic diversity. Made in Ladin language.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/zRkcJ5BZjpyRqQnzXLyN89xQDHk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":248850,"logo_path":null,"name":"elephy","origin_country":""},{"id":248851,"logo_path":null,"name":"Biennale Gherdeïna","origin_country":""},{"id":248852,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ar/Ge Kunst","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2025-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memory Is an Animal, It Barks with Many Mouths","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1747261,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eva Giolo","original_name":"Eva Giolo","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/tGTC5FE6LiLlG6DWXDMTTHi925g.jpg","credit_id":"677419990f248e850812b683","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1747261,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eva Giolo","original_name":"Eva Giolo","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/tGTC5FE6LiLlG6DWXDMTTHi925g.jpg","credit_id":"677419ad1c1d7e09cf6148ea","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1747261,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eva Giolo","original_name":"Eva Giolo","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/tGTC5FE6LiLlG6DWXDMTTHi925g.jpg","credit_id":"677419b52efbf3b41d928536","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1747261,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eva Giolo","original_name":"Eva Giolo","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/tGTC5FE6LiLlG6DWXDMTTHi925g.jpg","credit_id":"677419bc0f248e850812b691","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1747261,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eva Giolo","original_name":"Eva Giolo","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/tGTC5FE6LiLlG6DWXDMTTHi925g.jpg","credit_id":"677419c20f248e850812b696","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5151066,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Greta Langgartner","original_name":"Greta Langgartner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677419d398f2f82fc492a039","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5151067,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stefano Riba","original_name":"Stefano Riba","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677419dc0f248e850812b6ad","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2005913,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simonluca Laitempergher","original_name":"Simonluca Laitempergher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677419e61c1d7e09cf6148f1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":729,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uje6yt4OTOAxVbHH6fuKf9XSY2e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1296}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zRkcJ5BZjpyRqQnzXLyN89xQDHk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2025-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
