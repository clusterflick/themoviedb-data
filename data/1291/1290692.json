The story takes place in three days, which are perceived by protagonist Jakob as fatal for his life. On a business trip in a remote Mediterranean resort he gets involved in a fatal relationship with Melitta, a young hotel owner, and mayor, who proves to be his officially missing father. Melitta shows him the way to Čamčatka, a land where coordinates of our world have vanished and where everything is possible.","popularity":0.2285,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":28367,"logo_path":"/kw6n8hNwQXQSPlGdwVZvmbO0Haq.png","name":"RTV Slovenija","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":63197,"logo_path":null,"name":"A Atalanta","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Melitta","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","title":"Chamchatka","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1281072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sebastian Cavazza","original_name":"Sebastian Cavazza","popularity":0.2492,"profile_path":"/xC6gPRailgOCZASnBAR5YkB9bmR.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jakob Hofnagel","credit_id":"664474db01b10f96b9829e5f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1584196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tina Gorenjak","original_name":"Tina Gorenjak","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Melitta","credit_id":"664474e5e68b7c68cb77f96c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238612,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boris Cavazza","original_name":"Boris Cavazza","popularity":0.0975,"profile_path":"/9lnvnxXQTqwO0Tz5KG7VMCndk24.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Župan","credit_id":"664474ed64e340818f77f5e0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1052114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ena Begović","original_name":"Ena Begović","popularity":0.1144,"profile_path":"/tj5DkfEpLulJYY81VwrlxqeGy5M.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Ana","credit_id":"664474f98cd8de4dba1c796c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1445340,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jože Babič","original_name":"Jože Babič","popularity":0.2037,"profile_path":"/l3ow38cZ285qes6WP9qDAuqveFv.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Quite Gentleman","credit_id":"66447503a8faaaac103d326a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1133424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uroš Potočnik","original_name":"Uroš Potočnik","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":"/nPY4F6qUC3mxoQlj69eTCWBGoEi.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Tonja","credit_id":"6644750d3f44dc5e3777fcdf","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lotos Šparovec","original_name":"Lotos Šparovec","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":"/dIY3pL6hiwov15qKf0qoKejx1dI.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Haymaker","credit_id":"664475199501519c9d1c6c2e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":584814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judita Zidar","original_name":"Judita Zidar","popularity":0.1437,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Tutor","credit_id":"66447523c7ceaa95da3d2e01","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1989880,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mitja Novljan","original_name":"Mitja Novljan","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664474caad08a305073d3015","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4715342,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Goran Gluvić","original_name":"Goran Gluvić","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664474c08ee7f81e2d91aadd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1989880,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mitja Novljan","original_name":"Mitja Novljan","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664474c4f3511a7a502d72de","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0115863","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
