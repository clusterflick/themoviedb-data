It begins with an apparently straightforward representational image which is gradually revealed to be an artifice, foregrounding the filmmaking process as subject matter. By superimposing and alternating identical framings of three windows filmed by day and by night the film uses their positive/negative aspect to construct and break down representational images and sounds.  Blue Bathroom consists of three parts which can be shown individually or together. These are Fan (6 mins, silent), Blue Bathroom (11 mins, sound) and Behind the Mask (8 mins, sound). Fan and Behind the Mask can also be presented as the two screen video installation Double Shutter.","popularity":0.0503,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blue Bathroom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1291629,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Smith","original_name":"John Smith","popularity":0.2224,"profile_path":"/5Iq1Owl6v9qdISFEyC4q5PEBao3.jpg","credit_id":"66449a090246f6c183829c31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
