The Dutch TV documentary BIG FUN IN THE BIG TOWN captured this on film. And 15-year-old Pascal Garnier was immediately fascinated by New York’s young rap celebrities. Almost 40 years later, with the assistance of Bill Adler - the former publicist of the legendary Def Jam label - he tracked down the artists of that time. Roxanne Shanté, DMC and Def Jam’s creative director Cey Adams reminisce and also talk about their current lives. In his grandmother’s house, hip-hop icon LL Cool J talks about the meaning of “I Need Love”. Pure emotion - for viewers and everyone involved.","popularity":1.0479,"poster_path":"/iyj96MSuSerZu08UMzeFP29hiZ8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113999,"logo_path":"/6H7TiOCd08UB1QAvSDUDi4ML8Ie.png","name":"Animal Tank","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2024-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Hip Hop Minute","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"LL Cool J","original_name":"LL Cool J","popularity":1.3586,"profile_path":"/dpOHjasRJz7rk9CVutd6L9WnWTc.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"672548ddc1212313ac7ed657","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103900,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darryl 'DMC' McDaniels","original_name":"Darryl 'DMC' McDaniels","popularity":0.2447,"profile_path":"/yqBGZpqSTj3sQPSq90v56AG543Y.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67254a94a499cc2ef705197c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1811162,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roxanne Shanté","original_name":"Roxanne Shanté","popularity":0.2311,"profile_path":"/5mjlBBwb8cNAZutFOlmtctT3LQ8.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"672549140df4e66d4d925f51","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5035634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cey Adams","original_name":"Cey Adams","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6725493771a545e933358fe9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168192,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Schoolly D","original_name":"Schoolly D","popularity":0.2201,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6725494171a545e933358fee","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5035636,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marley Marl","original_name":"Marley Marl","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"672549853449481baca9a9ed","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1694951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Adler","original_name":"Bill Adler","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/p9hHCgLyvfbSP1w4MCEAzaW6889.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6725499601c4dbfa94f69c2e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1924796,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heidi Smith","original_name":"Heidi Smith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"672549ac01c4dbfa94f69c3a","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4714289,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pascal Garnier","original_name":"Pascal Garnier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6643b330140b7fc7fab8a719","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2070414,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Remco Bikkers","original_name":"Remco Bikkers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672548af01c4dbfa94f69ba5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1580931,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wim Coryn","original_name":"Wim Coryn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672548b971a545e933358f9a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4714289,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pascal Garnier","original_name":"Pascal Garnier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672548c6ba4f82cb22b066f4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4714289,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pascal Garnier","original_name":"Pascal Garnier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672548d1c1212313ac7ed651","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2480,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iyj96MSuSerZu08UMzeFP29hiZ8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1754}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Munich International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2024-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
