When Death is sent on a job to see that Max goes through with his plan, they decided to try and convince Max to keep on living, an altruistic act Max reluctantly engages with even if death just wants their holiday.","popularity":0.4089,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":229018,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ring of The Dead
