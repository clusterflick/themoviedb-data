The first Soviet aircraft carrier, the Kyiv, became the flagship of the Northern Fleet. The school's students, future political officers of the Soviet navy, go on a long navigation voyage; meanwhile, at their alma mater the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy opens. Focusing on the history of the institution's changing ideological functions, Under the Sign of Anchor explores the complex and sometimes paradoxical connections between war and culture, the Soviet past and the present. The film is based on materials from film archives from the time of the collapse of the USSR and the first years of Ukraine's independence.","popularity":0.0898,"poster_path":"/uK4l9ZTqYgEo3fFosOF6MTKNkuh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2024-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Under the Sign of Anchor","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3777465,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Taras Spivak","original_name":"Тарас Співак","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/xTtEbACDeyFIZunQgpHVAQgUjA.jpg","credit_id":"6644931cee8cab60d777f030","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3777465,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Taras Spivak","original_name":"Тарас Співак","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/xTtEbACDeyFIZunQgpHVAQgUjA.jpg","credit_id":"66449329c4cb86b6efcf8d7d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2439821,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lyuba Knorozok","original_name":"Люба Кнорозок","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6644933fded4c62ccecf9228","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2615330,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roman Khimei","original_name":"Roman Khimei","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wNBzmZoWKdOPNlXSrwKgqJOk4Ne.jpg","credit_id":"6644935c0c18fad384241db6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32350108","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bjcgtAxmSuEys4MYzMYdnAeJ9H2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uK4l9ZTqYgEo3fFosOF6MTKNkuh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/1ns19yLhiruEB1q6JpqXIwLuAsu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Docudays UA International Documentary Human Rights Film Festival","release_date":"2024-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
