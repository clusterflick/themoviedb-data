Inspired by Kant's concept of \"The I, the Other I, and the Other,\" the film explores the thin line between reality and imagination, questioning the nature of identity and morality.  Francisco is an ordinary man, yet within him lies a storm of dark impulses. Through contemporary dance, the film portrays his internal struggle, where he envisions killing his partner—a vision starkly contrasted by his peaceful nature in reality. This juxtaposition highlights the conflict between his rational self and the chaotic forces within.  \"Convergence\" is a haunting exploration of the darkest corners of the human psyche, where the self is fractured and the true nature of our deepest thoughts is laid bare.","popularity":0.2259,"poster_path":"/aUzbHClXIiT1LAmjCRpYX78bzso.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":228931,"logo_path":null,"name":"ESPIRAL PRODUCTORA","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-03-05","revenue":4500,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"psychoanalisys and contemporany dance","title":"CONVERGENCE","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4713905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fab Bravo","original_name":"Fab Bravo","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"man","credit_id":"66438f8aaeba065c74694621","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4713907,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sigilo Celeste","original_name":"Sigilo Celeste","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"girl","credit_id":"66438fa840f123c73d77f10d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4713908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Granada performer","original_name":"Granada performer","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"subconscious","credit_id":"66438fbcd088e74113b8a468","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4713915,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Angelica Quezada","original_name":"Angelica Quezada","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664390378c0ffa838abaa24e","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4713923,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Prisma","original_name":"Prisma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664390f90a597e4be535d5ca","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Development"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4713912,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"CRISTIAN D PAULETTE","original_name":"CRISTIAN D PAULETTE","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664390186a122cade3962318","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4713920,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Guiselle Riquelme","original_name":"Guiselle Riquelme","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664390910a597e4be535d5b1","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Wardrobe Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4713922,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Ramona Piña","original_name":"Ramona Piña","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664390a7fc4e0b41ae34c388","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup & Hair"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4713919,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ignacio Kriman","original_name":"Ignacio Kriman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664390749d436235b8cb5bda","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Supervisor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"espiral.productora","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1Vf0x5lVJ6ylj66Cfuk7NIAbsbg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aUzbHClXIiT1LAmjCRpYX78bzso.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":238140,"name":"forced to kill"},{"id":332446,"name":"convergencia"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2021-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"CONVERGENCIA\"// RUEDA DE PRENSA // ESPIRAL PRODUCTORA 2021","key":"hy6ecuPlbGo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Behind the Scenes","official":false,"published_at":"2021-09-29T16:40:30.000Z","id":"664391e1fc4e0b41ae34c3a1"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"CONVERGENCIA\" (2021).
