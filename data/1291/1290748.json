The film is playful, it does not build on the bizarre, but on aesthetics, ethics and spirituality. She and He are in T(herapy), in their individual sessions the more introverted She and the extroverted He talk about and gradually uncover a particularly strong experience that in a way represents a turning in their emotional setback. We gradually realize that they do not have a problem accepting what has happened. She would just like to know where it happened, and He would like to see it all again.","popularity":0.0418,"poster_path":"/6R624u5fWXUIbNo1XFMlBqpvXn8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28367,"logo_path":"/kw6n8hNwQXQSPlGdwVZvmbO0Haq.png","name":"RTV Slovenija","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":66207,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmski sklad Republike Slovenije","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":229010,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arthouse","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seeing Van Gogh","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4715536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Denžič","original_name":"Barbara Denžič","popularity":0.0681,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"664494c54ec66580d0eea29a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1865759,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maja Gal Štromar","original_name":"Maja Gal Štromar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"664494cb3f44dc5e3777fe8f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":559105,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brane Gruber","original_name":"Brane Gruber","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":"/nC7Sr3hLTtad5ymtfofvwR48gB2.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"664494d06aceacecb52ec459","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4715533,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mladen Jernejec","original_name":"Mladen Jernejec","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664494aa6aceacecb52ec455","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4715533,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mladen Jernejec","original_name":"Mladen Jernejec","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664494b0f6a9c96dae3d2668","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6R624u5fWXUIbNo1XFMlBqpvXn8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
