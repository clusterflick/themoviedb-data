This shook him to the core, and with incredible efforts, perseverance and complete dedication to the poorest, together with his colleagues in the movement, helped thousands of homeless people and garbage collectors to return to life. More than 23,000 of them now live in well-organized settlements with new houses, schools, playgrounds and medical care.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/q2HtnsmiHhYWl9cwn2rNSief83b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28367,"logo_path":"/kw6n8hNwQXQSPlGdwVZvmbO0Haq.png","name":"RTV Slovenija","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":228938,"logo_path":null,"name":"Etika Studio Fos","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Malagasy","iso_639_1":"mg","name":""},{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pedro Opeka, the Friend of the Poor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2782448,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pedro Opeka","original_name":"Pedro Opeka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"66a5163fd2a1b2cdfe60a1ec","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4714042,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jože Možina","original_name":"Jože Možina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66439b210caab4d340b8a59a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4714042,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jože Možina","original_name":"Jože Možina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66439b1ad6ec7fa4acbaa9d1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34230543","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q2HtnsmiHhYWl9cwn2rNSief83b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
