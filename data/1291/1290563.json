It tells the story of Dr. Horrible, an aspiring supervillain, Captain Hammer, his superhero nemesis, and Penny, their mutual love interest. The movie was written by writer/director Joss Whedon, his brothers Zack Whedon and Jed Whedon, and Jed's then fianc√©e, actress Maurissa Tancharoen. The writing team penned the musical during the WGA strike. The idea was to create something small and inexpensive, yet professionally done, in a way that would circumvent the issues that were being protested during the strike.","popularity":2.0659,"poster_path":"/Ag9FEOTyldtvhOo9qCmb2jqgbhY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10567,"logo_path":"/kbZu62C3ZwNfOtao1ECIFTzL40Q.png","name":"Mutant Enemy Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-07-15","revenue":3000000,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Freeze ray.
