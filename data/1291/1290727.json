Opinions differ about Ahmad Mansour. Born in Israel to a Palestinian family, the nationally known psychologist Mansour fights against anti-Semitism and extremism in Germany. The devout Muslim warns against political Islam, does preventive work and at the same time criticizes Germany's migration policy. He seeks dialogue and yet, as a highly vulnerable person, he can no longer take a step in public without massive police protection. Journalists from \"report München\" were able to exclusively accompany Ahmad Mansour for months and in the documentary they show how he continues despite the constant pressure and death threats against himself and his family. Will he be able to talk to his harshest critics or will he, like so many others, give up in frustration?","popularity":0.0825,"poster_path":"/gLeLEy3hN8KybPPn2O3uMDsFrRZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162,"logo_path":"/pIK5tsFVxjoXTJGcd0nYhiL1kn1.png","name":"BR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2024-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ahmad
