His series Q (1968–1980) and There’s A Lot Of It About (1982) shattered comedy conventions with sketch after sketch of absurd brilliance.  This compilation features classic moments like The Eurovision Joke Contest, Spike as a singing Viking maiden, and insects auditioning for a David Attenborough documentary. Interwoven with these are unique interstitials featuring Bruce Hammal at Milligan’s home—but in true Spike fashion, the interviews become sketches themselves, complete with his long-suffering comedy butler, Piles.  This release is a slightly re-edited, repackaged version of the 1995 BBC VHS Spike Milligan: One Man and His Ideas.","popularity":0.395,"poster_path":"/oxUxT9Zocdoh2cXwnQKkrXwGfkz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2004-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Best of Spike Milligan","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Spike Milligan: One Man and His Ideas","type":"VHS (1996)"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Spike Milligan","original_name":"Spike Milligan","popularity":0.2576,"profile_path":"/7YMXZHLboeqrmgTJIq8XWUhfpW9.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67d322d6705d6831173e05e4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3759638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Hammal","original_name":"Bruce Hammal","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Interviewer","credit_id":"635a20ec2d8ef30079fe36a6","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Spike Milligan","original_name":"Spike Milligan","popularity":0.2576,"profile_path":"/7YMXZHLboeqrmgTJIq8XWUhfpW9.jpg","credit_id":"635a217c2495ab007f3fde4e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Vosburgh","original_name":"Dick Vosburgh","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635a220955bc35007e926e61","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3759642,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Roy Turvey","original_name":"Roy Turvey","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635a223f297338007fcec8fb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105719,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrew Marshall","original_name":"Andrew Marshall","popularity":0.1625,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635a21ad3c887d007aedd496","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105718,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Renwick","original_name":"David Renwick","popularity":0.2343,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635a21c487e63e00795dd080","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1516198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Shand","original_name":"Neil Shand","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635a21942495ab007f3fde5e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117295,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Antrobus","original_name":"John Antrobus","popularity":0.1243,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"635a22236dc6c0009048214d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2166088,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maurice Sellar","original_name":"Maurice Sellar","popularity":0.0543,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643bdea937806202eb15f10f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":212239,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan J.W.
