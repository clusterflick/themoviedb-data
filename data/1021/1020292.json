She shone a few years later alongside Jean-Paul Belmondo in \"L'Homme de Rio\". From there, a great international career is announced to the young actress. But in 1967, a few months after filming the \"Demoiselles de Rochefort\" with her sister, she died tragically in a road accident, at the age of 25. Nevertheless, she leaves behind an abundant career and thus continues to be present in the minds of cinephiles.","popularity":0.0535,"poster_path":"/egfAV3ArZ3fe5rhVc3z9FvtDrVE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Françoise Dorléac, de L'Homme de Rio aux Demoiselles de Rochefort","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":18809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Françoise Dorléac","original_name":"Françoise Dorléac","popularity":0.4531,"profile_path":"/zPAmgTqb1NWBN7NMU1EqnR7PQB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"631408db21621d007d4eccd5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":41013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Agacinski","original_name":"Sophie Agacinski","popularity":0.4296,"profile_path":"/f7uokEce5OwmyNPPfhotLoHDtJJ.jpg","credit_id":"637e26b8a5743d00b5f5ec4e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":1078,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/29YCSBaaU09OyigDM7qVuDJW8qR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/egfAV3ArZ3fe5rhVc3z9FvtDrVE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.759,"height":1176,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/7scfIixcYpxeXRl2WAqDWVOHjmb.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":892}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":154866,"name":"archive footage"},{"id":213803,"name":"french cinema"},{"id":221078,"name":"old footage"},{"id":239463,"name":"film archives"},{"id":318336,"name":"famous actress"},{"id":325955,"name":"french actress"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2021-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
