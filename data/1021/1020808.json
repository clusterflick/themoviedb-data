Many fled to neighbouring Bangladesh and other countries in search of safety. Following widespread ethnic cleansing by the Burmese army in August 2017, a mass exodus of over 700,000 Rohingya took place from Myanmar to Cox's Bazar, where one million refugees now live. Filmed over several months in Cox's Bazar, Rohingya is an observational, poetic record of the community's everyday life, social rituals, and the camp's unique landscapes.","popularity":0.2842,"poster_path":"/n691YQzP5dhNRdKBVhhDngSZKhI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":133505,"logo_path":null,"name":"AWW Germany Gmbh","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2022-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rohingya","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081077,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ai Weiwei","original_name":"Ai Weiwei","popularity":0.3279,"profile_path":"/hD3ot74TFao8xDaeUaxuRK0RKsS.jpg","credit_id":"6315db85ba131b0081d188c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124865,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nils Pagh Andersen","original_name":"Nils Pagh Andersen","popularity":0.088,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6315dbbd326c19007f2d03d3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1887786,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chin-Chin Yap","original_name":"Chin-Chin Yap","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6315db8e71083a007b454a84","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081077,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ai Weiwei","original_name":"Ai Weiwei","popularity":0.3279,"profile_path":"/hD3ot74TFao8xDaeUaxuRK0RKsS.jpg","credit_id":"6315db9a0284200080776cf7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15011372","wikidata_id":"Q114718345","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/n691YQzP5dhNRdKBVhhDngSZKhI.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yRzWLgLSbTohNswho7s4hFQkTyK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"All","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DMZ International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2022-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
