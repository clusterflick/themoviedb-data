A young man from the city is immersed in a completely different world. The life of the small village is full of intrigues, conflicts and dramas, to which the protagonist becomes a participant. Step by step he begins to understand and accept everything that is happening. The film ends with a celebration - the circumcision of a small child. This ancient Kazakh ritual brings people together again. Grievances and arguments are forgotten. The joy of being returns to people's souls. The film is a statement that if money is evil, and it is ineradicable, then kindness lives in any person soul , and it is also ineradicable.","popularity":0.1041,"poster_path":"/xXvNFh5JQIW653aL3XsLx6v8HFH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":229181,"logo_path":null,"name":"Merada Production","origin_country":"KZ"},{"id":155132,"logo_path":"/9jPkwn3euKXzuQxJSgQOtiQNo7d.png","name":"Ministry of Culture and Sports of the Republic of Kazakhstan","origin_country":"KZ"},{"id":173578,"logo_path":"/pTyYwFYpihJmfuRkOJoUZPtloAD.png","name":"Kazakh Cinema","origin_country":"KZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","name":"Kazakhstan"}],"release_date":"2022-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kazakh","iso_639_1":"kk","name":"қазақ"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Village","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Aul","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Aul (The Village)","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4062852,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Galym Amangeldiuly","original_name":"Galym Amangeldiuly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6461c3728c44b901364c193f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1827431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aisha Mamutova","original_name":"Aisha Mamutova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6461c37c6e0d7200ff4c0b83","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1766386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yerbolat Ospankulov","original_name":"Yerbolat Ospankulov","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6461c3886e0d72011eaad64c","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1028274,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serik Aprimov","original_name":"Serik Aprimov","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":"/r5A7GHJpvF6wnP5rRTV8O2vuhdH.jpg","credit_id":"6315c0d21511aa0080d8d64f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1028274,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serik Aprimov","original_name":"Serik Aprimov","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":"/r5A7GHJpvF6wnP5rRTV8O2vuhdH.jpg","credit_id":"6461c3dadbbb4200e22d662b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4062858,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gulmira Zaripova","original_name":"Gulmira Zaripova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6461c3f86e0d72013dcc9637","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2364107,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Samat Sharipov","original_name":"Samat Sharipov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6461c406ef8b32015555593b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2016167,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dinara Aprymova","original_name":"Dinara Aprymova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6461c4138c44b90153dbcf12","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1028274,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serik Aprimov","original_name":"Serik Aprimov","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":"/r5A7GHJpvF6wnP5rRTV8O2vuhdH.jpg","credit_id":"6461c429e3fa2f0124467788","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4062860,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Myrzali Zhienbaev","original_name":"Myrzali Zhienbaev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6461c445e3fa2f0103a194f3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4062861,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nikita Fomin","original_name":"Nikita Fomin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6461c455dbbb420170a960ff","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt19064482","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1429,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xXvNFh5JQIW653aL3XsLx6v8HFH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":" ","release_date":"2022-12-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
