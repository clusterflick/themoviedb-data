This sequence is then again copied-inverted, and so forth, each new sequence generating in turn the next one. Through this process, each subsequent generation complicates and enriches picture. The result is quite impressive. The sound, produced on a frequency synthesizer (oscillators and filters), punctuates the invert-copy sequences.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/b2jTIFGaBpBvcqqohQLm91c2TBX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Iris","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2205564,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Rovere","original_name":"Pierre Rovere","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63151cf37fcab3007a2182d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b2jTIFGaBpBvcqqohQLm91c2TBX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
