An old suitor notices her bare ring finger and senses a second chance. While on a fishing trip, he happens to catch the fish that seems to have swallowed the thrown-away ring. Luck befalls him once again as later in the day, he wins a card game with the fisherman who, frustrated, has to give up his own ring. The old suitor is now in possession of both rings, while things only go downhill for the poor fisherman.
