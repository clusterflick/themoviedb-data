The present film has followed those visually challenged actors through different phases of practising theatre. Also, this documentary captures a few scenes of Rabindranath Tagore's play “Raktakarabi” (Red Oleanders), being staged by those visually challenged performers. This is a tribute to an incredible tale of human achievement.","popularity":0.0457,"poster_path":"/kuRBFtAYHurasHRxTG8tW2CWvWL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2021-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"8th Day of the Week","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3689175,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sovan Tarafder","original_name":"Sovan Tarafder","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/xB9qf1fA4qemIVar5sKahUZjJtY.jpg","credit_id":"6315dffafab3fa0084c22e40","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3689175,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sovan Tarafder","original_name":"Sovan Tarafder","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/xB9qf1fA4qemIVar5sKahUZjJtY.jpg","credit_id":"6315dfea71083a007b454c0f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3689246,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sumanta Samanta","original_name":"Sumanta Samanta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6315dfcfd40d4c007ab0fcd8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3689175,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sovan Tarafder","original_name":"Sovan Tarafder","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/xB9qf1fA4qemIVar5sKahUZjJtY.jpg","credit_id":"6315dfde0284200080776eae","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1417469,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Souvik Basu","original_name":"Souvik Basu","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6315e0970c1255007b8feafd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3689250,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Subrata Mallik","original_name":"Subrata Mallik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6315e0af0c1255007b8feb10","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kuRBFtAYHurasHRxTG8tW2CWvWL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"27th Kolkata International Film Festival","release_date":"2022-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"4th South Asian Short Film Festival","release_date":"2021-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
