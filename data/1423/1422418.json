Yet, for people still connected to land, to water, and to all human and non-human beings, soil is generosity itself. This is why generous people in Palestine are literally referred to as people of the soil, Ahl el Thara. This film charts a journey through the lives and terrains of people from around the world who share common attributes of warm-heartedness, generosity, and responsibility towards all living creatures.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":143318,"logo_path":null,"name":"Somerset House","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"People of the Soil","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5198560,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vivien Sansour","original_name":"Vivien Sansour","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67925a76316dcc0337470ded","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5198562,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Neville Wisdom","original_name":"Neville Wisdom","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67925a82e5a0922053fa84fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
