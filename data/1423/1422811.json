Born in 19th Century Bern, Hodler was an orphan whose painting of Wilhelm Tell has become an iconic piece of Swiss art. Prominent contributors such as writer Peter Bichsel and artist Rudolf Schindler comment on what makes Hodler’s pictures so iconic. Enlightening, moving and far removed from any clichés, the film explains the great themes of Hodler’s work – man, nature, love and death – and takes a fascinating journey into an artistic and very contemporary world.","popularity":0.1829,"poster_path":"/9Mbdwb4TmP6kI9V9opImCnAr6tF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ferdinand Hodler - The Heart Is My Eye","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2032761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Bichsel","original_name":"Peter Bichsel","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6793563c25d2980fb0238f0e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5199964,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jura Brüschweiler","original_name":"Jura Brüschweiler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67935668559e2d974b482eac","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5199965,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolf Schindler","original_name":"Rudolf Schindler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67935685559e2d974b482ec9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3815540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harald Szeemann","original_name":"Harald Szeemann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6793569925d2980fb0238f1e","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1532040,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heinz Bütler","original_name":"Heinz Bütler","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679355c65a7d80731d18527f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2740619,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Peter Hammann","original_name":"Peter Hammann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679355ed16a8fe8ece238eab","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41201,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Matthias Kälin","original_name":"Matthias Kälin","popularity":0.0839,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679355fd0a30d6d05923906a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2203288,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anja Bombelli","original_name":"Anja Bombelli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679356170a30d6d059239079","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1054002","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9Mbdwb4TmP6kI9V9opImCnAr6tF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":526}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2004-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
