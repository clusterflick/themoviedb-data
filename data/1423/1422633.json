Thoughts blend with impressions in a dream-like, painterly experimental documentary film. The film brings forth Kristina's worldview as a child, during the vast socio-political changes of the collapsing Soviet Union. Kristina's voice leads the audience to a journey through her fading, ephemeral memories and experiences. The film utilizes a combination of techniques: Timelapse videos of a summer sky shot on location in Lithuania, digital volumetric 3D simulation, and modern AI algorithms as animators to visualize the narration into the moving clouds.","popularity":0.0682,"poster_path":"/jUtfe1y3hTx439dmk3oFdOFRWCJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memories in the Clouds","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3957361,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristina Laine","original_name":"Kristina Laine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Voiceover","credit_id":"6792d137385d0cebe5237d35","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3957361,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristina Laine","original_name":"Kristina Laine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6792d0ad08c1729ec9183c52","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3957361,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristina Laine","original_name":"Kristina Laine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6792d10244ef39c860184216","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3957361,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristina Laine","original_name":"Kristina Laine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6792d11b90390f4881183d15","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3715755,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Albert Laine","original_name":"Albert Laine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6792d1ca08c1729ec9183c63","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3715755,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Albert Laine","original_name":"Albert Laine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6792d1d5c5081346f1482297","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3715755,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Albert Laine","original_name":"Albert Laine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6792d1e808c1729ec9183c6c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jUtfe1y3hTx439dmk3oFdOFRWCJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
