Since ancient times, the people of the small Pamir village have been reclaiming patches of land from the mountains for crops. There was only one person in the village who did not know poverty and sorrow, the world-eating kulak Pir Karim-sho. The son of Karim-sho - Shamba fell in love with the daughter of a poor man, the beautiful Sabina. But Sabina dreamed of a friend whom she did not know, but who would bring her love and happiness, not wealth. It was then that the rumor spread that poor Sabina, who had abandoned her rich husband, was insane. But the day came when the border guards, the first representatives of the Soviet government, arrived in the village.","popularity":0.0937,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":16158,"logo_path":"/reOYfM5jvosymeNcSoNiUoGz6n4.png","name":"Tajikfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1961-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sabina","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1784069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mayram Isayeva","original_name":"Марьям Исаева","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"679179b42a7aff0c3b28d3b5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5197293,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Konstantin Levashov","original_name":"Константин Левашов","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"679179f42a7aff0c3b28d3c5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1784172,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Khabibullo Abdurazakov","original_name":"Хабибулло Абдуразаков","popularity":0.1157,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67917a212a7aff0c3b28d3d7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1806005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mushrafa Kasymova","original_name":"Muşarrafa Qosimova","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/gKOUO6KfrCtKkLDQnf8fnBJLPMu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67917a27be9a9aa782777275","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1784067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Khodzhakuli Rakhmatullaev","original_name":"Khodzhakuli Rakhmatullaev","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67917a2dbe9a9aa782777279","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2879617,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margarita Kasymova","original_name":"Marvorit Kasymova","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/caJguqHDPohHEDQVQ6J1Em2QjDC.jpg","credit_id":"67917a41ba46990f54e011c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1341967,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nikolai Rozhkov","original_name":"Nikolai Rozhkov","popularity":0.0802,"profile_path":"/deyrpjieUYJuu2qQFomOZ1ZMYkQ.jpg","credit_id":"67917a58550e6fc3cde01f4e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1961-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
