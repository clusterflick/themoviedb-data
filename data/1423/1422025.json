How did she get here? What do the stones symbolize â€“ as alien in the landscape as the woman herself in her black dress? Here you can sense a story about both sadness, integrity and stubbornness, about intersecting paths and about continuing forward without bowing to others. Both the stones and the woman are filmed from a variety of angles, giving the viewer an opportunity to experience the event from different perspectives, and for a moment possibly drop the anthropocentric gaze.","popularity":0.1427,"poster_path":"/pKKSjfUeCVtcla9yLuHU2SmmE5j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2024-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Stone Putter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5197216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mia Lindahl","original_name":"Mia Lindahl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"679168efd8100c6d79e00cbc","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3333080,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nils Agdler","original_name":"Nils Agdler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67916914a7f27130bb28c669","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3333080,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nils Agdler","original_name":"Nils Agdler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67916976297a5d91d0776da3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3333080,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nils Agdler","original_name":"Nils Agdler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679169882a7aff0c3b28d0e9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3333080,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nils Agdler","original_name":"Nils Agdler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6791699cbca8037dab28d0db","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3333080,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nils Agdler","original_name":"Nils Agdler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679169aeff3ad134e0774566","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3333080,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nils Agdler","original_name":"Nils Agdler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679169f2ba46990f54e00e7c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1377,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pKKSjfUeCVtcla9yLuHU2SmmE5j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":918}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
