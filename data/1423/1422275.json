Through interviews with the founders of QueerFest, volunteers and staff who have contributed to the festival, the 14-year journey of the festival and the culture and arts landscape shaped by Turkey's political climate are told.  QueerFest's self-organizational connection with the Pink Life Association, its connection with the “lubunya” (queer community) of Ankara and the cultural capital it inherited from there, is transformed into a powerful political voice by developing the practice of mobilizing through art. Since 2017, the festival has continued its resistance against the bans and heavy censorship obstacles every year and opens a space for many queer people living in Turkey who are interested in the field of culture and art and want to produce in this sphere.","popularity":0.2218,"poster_path":"/xs3lvW1Hjzs7lTT5ALjxVf1yYbk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Not only a film festival, but also a space for resistance","title":"Memory-ish: An Oral History of QueerFest","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3314113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bilge Taş","original_name":"Bilge Taş","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"679205f2faa345939446fbda","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5197948,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Müge Atala","original_name":"Müge Atala","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"679208e6e5a0922053fa75bb","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5197934,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Asya Leman","original_name":"Asya Leman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679206945148f8767cfa739f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5197935,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Çağla Sumru","original_name":"Çağla Sumru","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679206affaa345939446fc33","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5197934,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Asya Leman","original_name":"Asya Leman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679206c0faa345939446fc3f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5197935,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Çağla Sumru","original_name":"Çağla Sumru","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679206cda8ce3489ceb573df","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5197934,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Asya Leman","original_name":"Asya Leman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679206dbfaa345939446fc4f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5197935,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Çağla Sumru","original_name":"Çağla Sumru","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679206e8a8ce3489ceb573f0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"tr","file_path":"/yTVB2OfcSzFmtRaBogyzLQls181.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"tr","file_path":"/w9X6bSYuh2ppegkJQRYArpMchRS.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"tr","file_path":"/xs3lvW1Hjzs7lTT5ALjxVf1yYbk.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.759,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"tr","file_path":"/wbiXgdp6DQKY1nmzLTLzOXwSeDJ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":569}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":275749,"name":"lgbt activism"},{"id":280179,"name":"lgbt rights"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tr","note":"","release_date":"2025-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
