The work is an assemblage of research material: footage from university labs and the archives of the Natural History Museum; records of Darwin's experiments with earthworms at Down House; images of worms in art and popular culture; and myriad other annelid imagery. Two choreographies move through all of this: one is a text that moves linguistically through soil horizons. The other is movement material showing tasks enacted by a lone performer working with rope. The body casts, crawls and turns, flattening and coiling, continuously without acknowledgement. This is an experiment in embodying the worm as an image - in exploring softness, resilience strength and hidden labour.","popularity":0.0462,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":143318,"logo_path":null,"name":"Somerset House","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wormshine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5200371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Williams","original_name":"Sam Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6793a31d559e2d974b483d9b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
