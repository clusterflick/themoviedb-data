Eleven years later, she turns to performance as a gestural act to birth the swords of Ogum and other vegetal kingdom species-royalties, transforming childbirth into a spell. Surrounded by the swords, she finds ways to defend herself and challenge modern science, which is deeply rooted in coloniality, racism, and the exploitation of human and non-human bodies. Modernity, after all, seizes the planet and its kingdoms to destroy them under colonial capitalist disregard.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/6QbX6bHRrZn5Yfgye7ceeFdAlug.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2025-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quando Parir é um Feitiço","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5198211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marina Fortunato","original_name":"Marina Fortunato","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Marina","credit_id":"679229e17c2da21c06b57e25","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5198211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marina Fortunato","original_name":"Marina Fortunato","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679229e921048e9f58fa7ae0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5198211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marina Fortunato","original_name":"Marina Fortunato","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679229fa21048e9f58fa7aea","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5198211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marina Fortunato","original_name":"Marina Fortunato","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67922a007c2da21c06b57e39","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5198213,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Carolina Rocha","original_name":"Carolina Rocha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67922a15316dcc033747024b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5198213,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Carolina Rocha","original_name":"Carolina Rocha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67922a2aefa85337c3fa7724","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5198214,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Lindomberto Ferreira Alves","original_name":"Lindomberto Ferreira Alves","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67922a3b316dcc0337470263","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5198213,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Carolina Rocha","original_name":"Carolina Rocha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67922a49316dcc0337470278","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/54ycloHzIaitSh8kTDCrUzgB0sM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/6QbX6bHRrZn5Yfgye7ceeFdAlug.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"14","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"28º Mostra de Cinema de Tiradentes","release_date":"2025-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
