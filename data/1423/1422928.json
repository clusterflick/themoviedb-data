From immigration issues in early schools to the controversial demise of their widespread use in the 1950s and 1960s, the Emmy-nominated \"Country School: One Room - One Nation\" combines visually stunning images of a myriad of restored and decaying buildings, including one designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, with surprising, humorous and heartwarming stories from former teachers and students. More than just nostalgia, \"Country School\" also delves into the dark side of the one-room school experience and dispels the myths behind the revered institution that helped bind a young nation together. Powerful on-camera commentary from a who's who of one-room school historians and writers provides insight into lessons learned from the school days and school ways of yesteryear. Multilingual classrooms, guns in school, and the pain of consolidation and closure remind us that the dramatic one-room school story continues to provide insight today.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/r4WQ3a8oBaGlOkM8qS7ojLIOthQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Country School: One Room - One Nation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1821382","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r4WQ3a8oBaGlOkM8qS7ojLIOthQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1050}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
