Thus, Cassandre, Marie d'Angevine, Hélène de Surgères come back to life for a few moments for us. This evocation does not forget the friendship between Ronsard and another great poet of the 16th century, also born on the banks of the Loire, Joachim du Bellay. It takes us to the castles of Blois and Taley, to the manor of La Denysière, to Couture, Ronsard's birthplace, and to the priory of Saint-Cosme-les-Tours, where the poet died.","popularity":0.2147,"poster_path":"/qlWHKH1Z2bB7QfAfebdK9PtGQc1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1293,"logo_path":"/4r2EdENtYK1Ddxmciod3XvmfA9k.png","name":"Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1970-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pierre de Ronsard, Gentleman from Vendôme","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henri Virlogeux","original_name":"Henri Virlogeux","popularity":0.5,"profile_path":"/cDNnWUqs3CPrHisXtQB82KQEB0n.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ronsard (old)","credit_id":"67916405bca8037dab28ce56","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Etcheverry","original_name":"Robert Etcheverry","popularity":0.1738,"profile_path":"/4L7hJr5oXuRROdDHm2lBKsVnS3V.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ronsard (young)","credit_id":"67916458bca8037dab28ce6d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2325313,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Lefol","original_name":"Anne Lefol","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/2WcWe5tNucFSiw7g8ErjkUCvzaV.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Cassandre","credit_id":"6791648aa3c7d79472e012d3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1235208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Sinigalia","original_name":"Annie Sinigalia","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/iQvMgDVSV5pJX38TPO9tzE98k9.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Marie","credit_id":"679164a0a3c7d79472e012f7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":150916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nita Klein","original_name":"Nita Klein","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Hélène de Surgères","credit_id":"679164b52a7aff0c3b28ce7e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1289972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Simon Prévost","original_name":"Jean-Simon Prévost","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/yqaGW7xpKpdMSmqPefnGEVb6rzf.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Joachim du Bellay","credit_id":"679164e3ff3ad134e0774415","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1345420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gil Baladou","original_name":"Gil Baladou","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"679164fbff3ad134e0774431","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5197186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michèle Persane","original_name":"Michèle Persane","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"679165112d61c33e63e01547","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":929334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Nastorg","original_name":"Michel Nastorg","popularity":0.0592,"profile_path":"/mU8cO7Zykc9v9X3NN6AalDYtyTM.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6791651e2d61c33e63e01557","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545562,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Lacombe","original_name":"Georges Lacombe","popularity":0.185,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67916389bca8037dab28ce36","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qlWHKH1Z2bB7QfAfebdK9PtGQc1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":832,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ktxKUsQiPTcxqemHWpWHl0U3KiW.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":624}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ORTF","release_date":"1970-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
