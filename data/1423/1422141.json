In their quest to win, Ben goes a bit overboard with his ex, and his friend’s end up roping in Emma, his freshman sister. Wanting to be cool and one of the guys, Emma gets sucked into their plan to rack up points without realizing it. Ben suddenly feels compelled to protect her, which sparks a dilemma: confront his friends at the Post-Scav Hunt party or play it cool and enjoy his final moments of high school with his bros.","popularity":0.4711,"poster_path":"/zVLJSD2mcqBx9roG3SA9KjgL7WC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ben's Sister","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3246094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Weinswig","original_name":"Ben Weinswig","popularity":0.0432,"profile_path":"/s3KRgutmsA9SNyfv5rtm9upUZn8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6791b23ce8b67ff833fa667c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1900369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Gandolfini","original_name":"Michael Gandolfini","popularity":0.7024,"profile_path":"/28b4ER8m7AJ40vsgocFIhwTKkzp.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6791b242e8b67ff833fa6683","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3132260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Rechner","original_name":"Sam Rechner","popularity":0.1515,"profile_path":"/cjFwkjJY7G2MxNnTzPuM1rPXG3G.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6791b249e8b67ff833fa6697","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3756943,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emma Weinswig","original_name":"Emma Weinswig","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/xq4kcxnK8EdibYLac8xbr1uB5c.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6791b250749b2bc5b546f624","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2263919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siena Werber","original_name":"Siena Werber","popularity":0.2731,"profile_path":"/beWsyqlvjGi9cwJZFqayUpIvSyb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6791b256749b2bc5b546f633","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1505505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexis G.
