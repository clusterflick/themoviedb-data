Despite limited space in his shared flat with friends, Akam feels obligated to invite his uncle to stay for a few days. However, his uncle quickly makes himself at home and shows no sign of leaving anytime soon. Torn between his sense of familial duty and growing tension in the flat, Akam begins to suspect there's more to his uncle's visit than just a casual trip. What follows is a series of revelations and unexpected events that could have life changing consequences for them both.","popularity":0.2394,"poster_path":"/4EYhmk8ONVx1tT37ov8QjrvWl08.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":251857,"logo_path":"/mqw0XZEgWObkqTfHQVzS1pkjWJo.png","name":"True Content Production","origin_country":"NO"},{"id":159148,"logo_path":"/lPrQ4Msghtyumwyk09uKTiKEMGq.png","name":"Tangaj Production","origin_country":"RO"},{"id":189258,"logo_path":"/i77SPCRCRDsFffKvcosikw4dhpP.png","name":"Oslo Filmfond","origin_country":"NO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2025-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""},{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Uncle Jens","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","title":"Onkel Jens","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4190582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peiman Azizpour","original_name":"Peiman Azizpour","popularity":0.0701,"profile_path":"/vNQo1LRAJVHPwthwF3lYPp2PWgr.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Akam","credit_id":"679165a1bca8037dab28cf83","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2578992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hamza Agooshi","original_name":"Hamza Agooshi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/mHe3z6BSUyB2T75LYJW5jaMqLmX.jpg","cast_id":25,"character":"Khdr","credit_id":"67b908bd5eb94d29c2f3cc1c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2571053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Francesca Brænne","original_name":"Sarah Francesca Brænne","popularity":0.0912,"profile_path":"/59oqEzrLIpAOnMJasgoRsYcVEFe.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Elina","credit_id":"679165adbca8037dab28cf8d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1479342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Magnus B.
