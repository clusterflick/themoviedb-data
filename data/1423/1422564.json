Portrayed by the renowned actress Joke Devynck, Yokeh, a soap opera star, is meticulously observed in the tapestry of her everyday existence. An ageing, crackling voiceover comments on Yokeh's actions and encounters, yet the narrator's desperate attempts to steer events prove mostly futile. The story takes an irreversible turn as the sun vanishes behind the moon, altering Yokeh's life forever.","popularity":0.0538,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Swirling Tangle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":65476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joke Devynck","original_name":"Joke Devynck","popularity":0.199,"profile_path":"/mDubm3wsiD6jMS8y66msTsWI19g.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6792a59a4f8c3b9d13ea3401","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1163951,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lucile Desamory","original_name":"Lucile Desamory","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6792a541d619d772affbf620","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1163951,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lucile Desamory","original_name":"Lucile Desamory","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6792a5484f8c3b9d13ea33ee","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1163948,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Damien Desamory","original_name":"Damien Desamory","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6792a559d619d772affbf62e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3593204,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Vincent Stroep","original_name":"Vincent Stroep","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6792a56ade97abd6dafbf52a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5199149,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ulrike Lindmayr","original_name":"Ulrike Lindmayr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6792a57ac0bbce0686fbf52c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451187,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guillaume Cailleau","original_name":"Guillaume Cailleau","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6792a58a16dce24fa8ffb767","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
