Fuelled by apple cake and Guinness, the English sheep farmer from the Lake District, an idyllic part of north-west England, broke multiple long-distance running records.  In 1971, he ran the fastest known time on Britain's National Three Peaks, a record that stands today; aged 50, he ran all 214 Wainwrights in seven days; when he turned 60, he ran 60 Lakeland fell tops in 36 hours; and at 70, he ran 70 fells.  This short film details his modest approach to an almost unimaginable yet enduring challenge.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/8BkKRfdtSrqZsyiXPIcwD9KT9Q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Joss Naylor, the shepherd with an unbeatable running record","title":"King of the Fells","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5198708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joss Naylor","original_name":"Joss Naylor","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/8BkKRfdtSrqZsyiXPIcwD9KT9Q.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67927240e6c71b7d26a037fe","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4158633,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Seth Whitfield","original_name":"Seth Whitfield","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6792740718107687dba035b9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4158633,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Seth Whitfield","original_name":"Seth Whitfield","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6792741c30055eb7e99202ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4158633,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Seth Whitfield","original_name":"Seth Whitfield","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6792743818107687dba035dd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5198725,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joseph Edwards","original_name":"Joseph Edwards","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67927489f48affb3c9ead5f8","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5198727,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Felicia Morizet","original_name":"Felicia Morizet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679274b99e4172cd38920675","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5198733,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kyle McFadzean","original_name":"Kyle McFadzean","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6792750d9e4172cd38920691","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5198737,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"India Munn","original_name":"India Munn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6792754c0ec6546aaaa0365e","department":"Art","job":"Title Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35047883","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8BkKRfdtSrqZsyiXPIcwD9KT9Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
