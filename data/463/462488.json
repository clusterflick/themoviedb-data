It begins when Ryan, still living at a homeless shelter and Laurie Gordon, a Montreal musician asks Ryan to «draw a few pictures» for her band’s video which serendipitously becomes Spare Change, Ryan’s first animation film in 35 years. We follow this quirky duo’s utopian attempt to get their film off the ground.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ryan's Renaissance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3646100","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
