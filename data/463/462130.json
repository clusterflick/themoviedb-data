The frontline of the global war is coming closer everyday; people are hungry, wor-ried, angry. In February the tsar is overthrown. Many artists are euphoric: Revolution! Freedom, finally? No. Starting in October, the Bolsheviks rule by themselves. What were poets, thinkers, and avant-gardists like Maxim Gorky and Kazimir Malevich doing during this drastic change of power? In the film, five of them alight from the director’s piles of books as animated cut-out figures. With their own recorded words in their mouths, they participate in salons, committees, and street riots.","popularity":0.342,"poster_path":"/k28EWidibZ8WiTEBpNcwdrMsuvE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130758,"logo_path":null,"name":"Katrin Rothe Filmproduktion","origin_country":""},{"id":28950,"logo_path":"/8RuUUKhPiJbICV03XO79IhSh8CH.png","name":"Dschoint Ventschr Filmproduktion","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":128022,"logo_path":null,"name":"Maxim Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":42145,"logo_path":"/fX8uY3tXWh814PLVqKM0IJEoDPW.png","name":"SRF","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":2067,"logo_path":"/y5knLIUjYsKBIlM4W0dLruWwYaC.png","name":"RBB","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2017-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1917: The Real October","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"1917 the Real October","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1904146,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maximilian Bauer","original_name":"Maximilian Bauer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Wladimir Majakowski (voice)","credit_id":"59de6be092514124cd0922c6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hanns Zischler","original_name":"Hanns Zischler","popularity":0.3326,"profile_path":"/5O4Dum1OuKI4RMB24xjACkL22iA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Alexander Benois (voice)","credit_id":"59de6bf2c3a36861df09b60d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Schneider","original_name":"Martin Schneider","popularity":0.2744,"profile_path":"/1i8XAU1WE6Fks8FEoEGxaqhxsEx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Maxim Gorki (voice)","credit_id":"59de6c0cc3a368620d0815c0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inka Friedrich","original_name":"Inka Friedrich","popularity":0.306,"profile_path":"/a90LTNdgFE5NHPGTNurWO2IXKhc.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dokumentarfilmerin (voice)","credit_id":"5cb5085b0e0a266ba2ec1863","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":33041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudia Michelsen","original_name":"Claudia Michelsen","popularity":0.2698,"profile_path":"/fsXA7ysKZ00Re2d6qZqrIuREf5J.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Sinaida Hippius (voice)","credit_id":"5cb50936c3a3686b0480acad","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1400583,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katrin Rothe","original_name":"Katrin Rothe","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e55689c3a3683ddd000a12","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6489962","wikidata_id":"Q29563356","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/frFqKleuGskbhawtd5YMfhSffxl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3uFfs9AXDiblB6sCNElDaB4uEi9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pymkZQE9IN84T0GzoMAbmd2tq3s.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/anRIPdlCU1ubLVr0QXONT8r2F34.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1521,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/k28EWidibZ8WiTEBpNcwdrMsuvE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1014}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Solothurn Film Festival","release_date":"2017-01-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2017-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Gijón Film Festival","release_date":"2017-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
