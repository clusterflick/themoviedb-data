Author and first-time filmmaker Mary Zournazi explores life on the streets through the eyes of the dogs and peoples' experience. Shot in location in Athens, the birthplace of democracy, the documentary is about how Greece has become the 'stray dogs of Europe', and how the dogs have become a symbol of hope for the people and for the anti- austerity movement. A universal story about love and loyalty and what we might learn from animals and peoples' timeless quest for democracy.","popularity":0.7699,"poster_path":"/axPqRFEgV3Vxeo63uybLjzADdf3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27295,"logo_path":null,"name":"ZigZag Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"},{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2017-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dogs of Democracy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1837530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Spiros ('Saint')","original_name":"Spiros ('Saint')","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"594c1e3cc3a368328b0142f9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1837532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugenia Tzirtzilaki","original_name":"Eugenia Tzirtzilaki","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"594c1e52c3a36832ad015b41","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1837534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rita Bellou","original_name":"Rita Bellou","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"594c1e5fc3a368323201513b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1804873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Y치nis Varouf치kis","original_name":"Y치nis Varouf치kis","popularity":0.1624,"profile_path":"/6e0ye3Fg3MXJhhrbKYIj4rWrRv7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"594c1e7c925141314b015de0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1837538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sozita Goudouna","original_name":"Sozita Goudouna","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"594c1e9c925141314b015dfc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1837539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jina Politi","original_name":"Jina Politi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"594c1eaec3a36832ca015e3a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1837540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexis Panselinos","original_name":"Alexis Panselinos","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"594c1ec1925141310c01661e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":174441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lex Marinos","original_name":"Lex Marinos","popularity":0.1072,"profile_path":"/vbx4OtcRmsKrqrQTyao0QDnnc8o.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"594c1edac3a368328b014360","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1837544,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danae Stratou","original_name":"Danae Stratou","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"594c1f02925141314b015e56","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1837546,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vera Andrikopoulou","original_name":"Vera Andrikopoulou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"594c1f18c3a3683279015e18","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1348366,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Zubrycki","original_name":"Tom Zubrycki","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/nPPW0pRmG7ryvsTW7Hsu324UiqE.jpg","credit_id":"594c1f37c3a368329b017f4c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1837548,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mary Zournazi","original_name":"Mary Zournazi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"594c1f619251413115016714","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1837549,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Peter Crombie","original_name":"Peter Crombie","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"594c2007c3a3683265017e40","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5974472","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"dogsofdemocracy","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.722,"height":1504,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/axPqRFEgV3Vxeo63uybLjzADdf3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1086}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1200,"name":"greece"},{"id":33640,"name":"democracy"},{"id":197940,"name":"stray dog"},{"id":222116,"name":"austerity"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New Hope Film Festival","release_date":"2017-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"Dogs of Democracy\" - trailer","key":"s4deL_HmIBQ","published_at":"2016-11-18T01:36:09.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"594c212c925141311f0168a1"}]}}}
