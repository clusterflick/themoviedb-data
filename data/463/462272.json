As political intrigue thwarts his heartfelt attempts to highlight the suffering of his people under the sanctions, he takes refuge at Mesocafé, a little Baghdad in West London. With their Arab, Assyrian, Jewish and Kurdish heritage, members of the Iraqi community allow him into their lives, sharing with him their stories and dreams. It is here that he meets the beautiful Bisan.","popularity":0.8566,"poster_path":"/kA5CbuJi5eHij4EMlIpLlG59XM3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United
