In the work, two neurologists describe losing and gaining the ability to experience the world in 3D, while their perceptual state is animated by images of optically altered landscapes. Filmed in the high desert of West Texas, the video moves through several carefully managed landscapes of water use and experience: an industrial tomato farm, a water well drilling site, a “natural” spring, a snowstorm, and an artist’s studio.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drowned World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1837426,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Thorp Brown","original_name":"Ben Thorp Brown","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"594bcb2fc3a36832ad01133d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
