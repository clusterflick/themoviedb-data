Shaken, she leaves and later tells her girlfriend about the incident. The girlfriend insists that she invite the fortune-teller to a party they're having at her house. What the woman doesn't realize is that the \"fortune-teller\" is actually the ex-husband she abandoned years ago, when she took their daughter and ran off with her lover. When the \"charlatan\" is invited to the party, he sees an opportunity to take his revenge on his faithless ex-wife.","popularity":0.1951,"poster_path":"/hw3hq7EEjZoqtRXYhN4cM0H01iz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1929-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Charlatan","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Holmes Herbert","original_name":"Holmes Herbert","popularity":0.2176,"profile_path":"/oCvbtPpsOEdrFLR6be8qkRfOZ3x.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Peter \"Count Merlin\" Dwight","credit_id":"59446ce4c3a36816760038ce","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Livingston","original_name":"Margaret Livingston","popularity":0.1148,"profile_path":"/7yrbb5QRn6Jy0xRzyzYMer1sh2q.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Florence Talbot","credit_id":"59446cfdc3a36816f600377e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rockliffe Fellowes","original_name":"Rockliffe Fellowes","popularity":0.0805,"profile_path":"/bkat22QmibDbdrwtg05RW68RpiJ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Richard Talbot","credit_id":"59446d10c3a36816f6003793","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1173173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philo McCullough","original_name":"Philo McCullough","popularity":0.2428,"profile_path":"/3rRW4z7GBHrXMzGNvTJldipaLBF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Walter Paynter","credit_id":"59446d229251413ff40035dd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":140874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita Garvin","original_name":"Anita Garvin","popularity":0.1176,"profile_path":"/gOPMlk1i6yhCSZxpqVwIAaW4IS7.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mrs. Paynter","credit_id":"59446d54c3a36816f60037c8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":940628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Crauford Kent","original_name":"Crauford Kent","popularity":0.1471,"profile_path":"/zYq9Z283YTCX5FYaG59nVs598TD.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Frank Deering","credit_id":"59446d63c3a368171b00330c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John George","original_name":"John George","popularity":0.5732,"profile_path":"/67eRsXH4BISHgoKXpLODrgSn4PN.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Count Merlin's Assistant (uncredited)","credit_id":"5945fdce9251413fad01f3f1","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931194,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Melford","original_name":"George Melford","popularity":0.2426,"profile_path":"/aV70vLKnT7p3mVk1CehvMIXq7T1.jpg","credit_id":"59446c3ec3a36816f600370f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0019757","wikidata_id":"Q18558751","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.65,"height":846,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hw3hq7EEjZoqtRXYhN4cM0H01iz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1929-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
