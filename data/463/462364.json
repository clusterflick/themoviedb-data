He has joined the Catholic order of the Steyler Missionaries to become a monk. If he doesn’t have a change of heart, he will take his final vows in a year’s time and commit to a life of chastity, poverty, obedience and service to the Catholic Church. Stephanie is highly critical of his choice. They come from a Catholic background, but Stephanie had her own reasons to break with the family tradition. They haven’t spoken in ten years. This film is Stephanie’s quest to understand her brother’s extreme decision and explore his world that lies behind the thick monastery walls. What she discovers may prove to be far more than she bargained for.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/t46LKmETALS6Sqf1zvCIXCXxNg7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2013-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Brother's Vows","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1835097,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephanie Weimar","original_name":"Stephanie Weimar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"594626139251413fb6021b19","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1835098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gregor Weimar","original_name":"Gregor Weimar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"59462657c3a368170f022fd3","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1835097,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephanie Weimar","original_name":"Stephanie Weimar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"594626039251413fb1023848","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1835097,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephanie Weimar","original_name":"Stephanie Weimar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"594625f19251413fb6021af6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2697272","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.717,"height":948,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t46LKmETALS6Sqf1zvCIXCXxNg7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
