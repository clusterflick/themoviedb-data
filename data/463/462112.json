This town is on the border between Portugal and Spain. People have lived here for centuries. During the day not much is happening. People who I portrayed are continuously doing the same things. Following the same routine of waiting next to the church, going to the bar for a coffee. But unlike other towns the energy of this village is divided into two parts. As the light starts to settle and darkness takes over the village all of a sudden the mystery and magic that did not exist during the day, knocks on the door of this town. And the viewer finds out that in this village the night belongs to mystery.","popularity":0.1065,"poster_path":"/r09hUvvdHmEjZrkTTy84bjOsiOl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","name":"Armenia"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2017-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Moon, the Sun and the Musketeers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Луна, солнце и мушкетёры","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"AM","title":"Լուսինը, Արեւը եւ Հրացանակիրները","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1787644,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rajan Kathet","original_name":"Rajan Kathet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d31867c2f8d090012d6f024","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1644358,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vahagn Khachatryan","original_name":"Vahagn Khachatryan","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d318671caab6d1640a447d7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1644358,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vahagn Khachatryan","original_name":"Vahagn Khachatryan","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d31864e2f8d094522d5175b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8282590","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"1900837413532861","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6svQXXMcVMPKGmzE2G2sDQFJ8cd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/r09hUvvdHmEjZrkTTy84bjOsiOl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Visions du Réel","release_date":"2017-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow International Film Festival","release_date":"2017-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
