Filmmaker Evelyn Lambart uses glowing zinc cut-outs to give this traditional tale a contemporary twist. Akin to a joyful medieval manuscript, the film is embellished by the artist's own whimsy—heraldic trumpet sounds, luminescent light, and wildflowers in every scene tell the message of rebirth. A film without dialogue.","popularity":0.0688,"poster_path":"/84tb5qRWjCTMh7JKT6hZ2j2Ifhr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1973-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Story of Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"L'histoire de Noël","type":"French title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":229994,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michel Descombes","original_name":"Michel Descombes","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"594b9e58c3a36832ad00ee25","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":938768,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evelyn Lambart","original_name":"Evelyn Lambart","popularity":0.0808,"profile_path":"/3mBzS7WzjdoZRjy3R7inPVSbuwp.jpg","credit_id":"594b9dd3c3a368326501052d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1410992,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Roger Lamoureux","original_name":"Roger Lamoureux","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"594b9e7d925141311f00f6a3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292559,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Karl du Plessis","original_name":"Karl du Plessis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"594b9e23925141315500fa59","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":938768,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evelyn Lambart","original_name":"Evelyn Lambart","popularity":0.0808,"profile_path":"/3mBzS7WzjdoZRjy3R7inPVSbuwp.jpg","credit_id":"594b9de3c3a368329b010448","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0234812","wikidata_id":"Q123287716","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1043,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/86gmcAVFydku5Ej4Cfn1L1KmNJR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1854}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/84tb5qRWjCTMh7JKT6hZ2j2Ifhr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181235,"name":"color"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
