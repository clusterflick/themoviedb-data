This hypnotic, visually and sonically immersive exploration of a haunted space unfolds in two parts. In the first, a woman (Eadaoin O’Donoghue) dissolves her identity into the ghostly resonances she finds in the rooms and corridors of a sprawling, atmospheric seaside basement property. In the second, a man (Rashidi), existing in a parallel dimension of the same space, pursues a bizarre and perverse amorous obsession.","popularity":0.0606,"poster_path":"/8T8XkVOPJR0MksmVxWEf8NVXNG1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91599,"logo_path":null,"name":"Close Watch","origin_country":""},{"id":25385,"logo_path":null,"name":"Experimental Film Society","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Weird Weird Movie Kids Do Not Watch The Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1837106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eadaoin O’Donaghue","original_name":"Eadaoin O’Donaghue","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"594ae7a1925141310c003b2d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1320818,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rouzbeh Rashidi","original_name":"Rouzbeh Rashidi","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/2DkY1J7A9o73lkQxq7Pkn7Nz20a.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"594ae7abc3a36832bd0039c8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1394615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maximilian Le Cain","original_name":"Maximilian Le Cain","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"594ae7b19251413115003be3","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1394615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maximilian Le Cain","original_name":"Maximilian Le Cain","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e931697caa47005b34943f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1320818,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rouzbeh Rashidi","original_name":"Rouzbeh Rashidi","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/2DkY1J7A9o73lkQxq7Pkn7Nz20a.jpg","credit_id":"62e93177965220005d2622d4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1320818,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rouzbeh Rashidi","original_name":"Rouzbeh Rashidi","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/2DkY1J7A9o73lkQxq7Pkn7Nz20a.jpg","credit_id":"594ae738c3a368329b003ec0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1320818,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rouzbeh Rashidi","original_name":"Rouzbeh Rashidi","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/2DkY1J7A9o73lkQxq7Pkn7Nz20a.jpg","credit_id":"594ae7509251413115003b96","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1394615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maximilian Le Cain","original_name":"Maximilian Le Cain","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"594ae725c3a36832bd003968","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1320818,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rouzbeh Rashidi","original_name":"Rouzbeh Rashidi","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/2DkY1J7A9o73lkQxq7Pkn7Nz20a.jpg","credit_id":"594ae78d9251413155003c00","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1394615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maximilian Le Cain","original_name":"Maximilian Le Cain","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"594ae72cc3a3683279003937","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1394615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maximilian Le Cain","original_name":"Maximilian Le Cain","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"594ae7719251413115003bab","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1097,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8T8XkVOPJR0MksmVxWEf8NVXNG1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":293336,"name":"experimental film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Weird Weird Movie Kids Do Not Watch The Movie (2013) / VOD","key":"120060646","site":"Vimeo","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-02-19T16:19:39.000Z","id":"62e931c1fc5f060061076f8c"}]}}}
