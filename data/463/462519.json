He desperately wants to do something for his former village, now in the newly created nation of South Sudan. His dream is to build a much-needed school, enlisting the backing of numerous Australians. Janet, a dedicated supporter, joins him on a 40-day fundraising walk from Tweed Heads to Sydney along with filmmaker Tom Zubrycki. But will this strategy raise the funds they need? Thwarted by escalating conflict back in South Sudan, and shocked by a broken relationship, Zac must decide what's important in his life.","popularity":0.0902,"poster_path":"/1Dxp2tMkUFoI0KowhtRRfzBj8V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34936,"logo_path":"/tWQ2ThZbnpwRsNYKOay3MMF94iC.png","name":"JOTZ
