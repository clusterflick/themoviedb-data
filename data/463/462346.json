Secretly shot on a mobile phone by Iranian journalist Behrouz Boochani while detained on Manus, in Papua New Guinea, the film is a collaboration with Dutch-Iranian filmmaker Arash Kamali Sarvestani. Boochani recounts, via the testimonies of fellow inmates, the abuse and violence inflicted and the precarious state of limbo they find themselves in. Chauka, the name of the dreaded solitary confinement unit within the detention centre, was originally the name of a beautiful bird and symbol of the Manus Island. By interweaving dialogue with two Manusian men and shots of daily life on the island, the film gives a much-needed voice to Manus inhabitants, understandably distressed by the current situation. With marked restraint, the film exposes lives broken by shocking immigration policies.","popularity":0.5823,"poster_path":"/bFK6cTk7Ha4jRg6VL1JE1qgYHhn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2017-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""},{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chauka, Please Tell Us The Time","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1835058,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Behrouz Boochani","original_name":"Behrouz Boochani","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Behrouz Boochani","credit_id":"5945c8cec3a368052d016115","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1835060,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arash Kamali Sarvestani","original_name":"Arash Kamali Sarvestani","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5945c937c3a368170f01a9bf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1835058,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Behrouz Boochani","original_name":"Behrouz Boochani","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59dbefcc925141252c0631c5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1835058,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Behrouz Boochani","original_name":"Behrouz Boochani","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59dbf002c3a3686227060327","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1835060,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arash Kamali Sarvestani","original_name":"Arash Kamali Sarvestani","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59dbedda925141252c062f69","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6229152","wikidata_id":"Q29446013","facebook_id":"ChaukaPleaseTellUsTheTime","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":933,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bFK6cTk7Ha4jRg6VL1JE1qgYHhn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":18339,"name":"human rights"},{"id":208863,"name":"asylum seekers"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fa","note":"","release_date":"2017-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Chauka Please Tell Us The Time – Trailer – SFF 17","key":"EwaVMPYEzrA","published_at":"2017-05-10T01:08:26.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5945cbf59251413fdd019c5a"}]}}}
