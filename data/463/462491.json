In the story, a mild-mannered bank clerk has heroic dreams of being a real he-man. Given his diffident, shy nature, it comes as a bit of a surprise that not only does he actually have a girlfriend, but he has managed to get her pregnant. However, she doesn't fit his image of himself, and he can't bring himself to marry her. When the bank he works in is robbed by a daring group which includes a magnetically attractive woman, the clerk throws his lot in with them and becomes an outlaw.","popularity":0.4712,"poster_path":"/brFQFu2qhR6OzwsQigdnMvP7qs3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51304,"logo_path":null,"name":"Séléna Audiovisuel","origin_country":""},{"id":11359,"logo_path":"/aqWJRi66t2oMPMmC60CdK9I3WQd.png","name":"France 2","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":10602,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pacific Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1986-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On a volé Charlie Spencer !","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Huster","original_name":"Francis Huster","popularity":0.7048,"profile_path":"/v2q1DoC8HPOKzo8uRpllC7nnRhQ.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"L'employé","credit_id":"59479607c3a36816e403a7ef","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Béatrice Dalle","original_name":"Béatrice Dalle","popularity":1.1202,"profile_path":"/fnzrkMSHwAfI1tEnRoY1DM1wMOU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"La star","credit_id":"59479614c3a36816e403a808","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabelle Nanty","original_name":"Isabelle Nanty","popularity":0.6173,"profile_path":"/9EQOZfhnqTL8enSFGFHMVU99q2P.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"La petite blonde","credit_id":"594796249251413fbb03acf6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Spiesser","original_name":"Jacques Spiesser","popularity":0.2419,"profile_path":"/92UQ3TpFDflsbUg9cekjYjYDQyl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"L'inspecteur","credit_id":"5947962e9251417e4c01ac60","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Pierre Aumont","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Aumont","popularity":0.2843,"profile_path":"/fqOYvFaBypZ3v1Szq1GuQJhpK4F.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Le héros, séq.
