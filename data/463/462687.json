There is piousness steeped in blind faith as they try to survive and in Ingo's unseeing eyes, even something beautiful atop the mountains. But as a newcomer to an established fiefdom, their uneasy foothold in the village collapses when Julio is involved in a murder incident. The one witness, an outcast thief, holds the key to Julio's ultimate fate.","popularity":0.0618,"poster_path":"/xET8qO6jGYM9lwfMMerVwCWaO8X.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mountain Thief","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2620160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Casas","original_name":"Richard Casas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Ingo","credit_id":"5eab2e272d1e40001d861f37","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2620161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Randy Catonjay","original_name":"Randy Catonjay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Julio","credit_id":"5eab2e46a12856001b6913e0","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1836509,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gerry Balasta","original_name":"Gerry Balasta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59496316c3a3687ea800353e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1836509,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gerry Balasta","original_name":"Gerry Balasta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59496321c3a3681115043cbf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2620150,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nina Balasta","original_name":"Nina Balasta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eab2c0dcc9683001cb16aab","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1836509,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gerry Balasta","original_name":"Gerry Balasta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eab2c1e2d1e40001f861833","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317053,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Francisco Adolfo Valdez","original_name":"Francisco Adolfo Valdez","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eab2c5a945d36001f86674e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2620153,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Tremante","original_name":"Michael Tremante","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eab2c6e2d1e40001f8618ad","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1247406","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xET8qO6jGYM9lwfMMerVwCWaO8X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
