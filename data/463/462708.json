Featuring music by Malaria, Reflections, Einstürzende Neubauten, Frieder Butzmann and Die Tödliche Doris. It’s a hit or miss affair with films that range from the brilliant to the banal. Well worth watching for the flashes of genius.","popularity":0.1634,"poster_path":"/p5KbOwhztqmHWyiiHsJmuHCKg2c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2005-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Berlin Super 80","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1608205,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brigitte Bühler","original_name":"Brigitte Bühler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65abdf4ad5191f00a430f0f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1608219,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yana Yo","original_name":"Yana Yo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65abdfce1f3e6000a1feb3cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1608238,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Gramming","original_name":"Walter Gramming","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65abdf5b72d85500c3442cb7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jörg Buttgereit","original_name":"Jörg Buttgereit","popularity":0.0887,"profile_path":"/7mWcREHlwk3ZoAO70j1sErU8ke9.jpg","credit_id":"65abdf3c976a2300bc77dd31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1608215,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anette Maschmann","original_name":"Anette Maschmann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65abdf8b99d5c300bd7cd5f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":52155,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Frieder Butzmann","original_name":"Frieder Butzmann","popularity":0.0724,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65abdf43d5191f00a330f2c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1608241,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Volker Rendschmidt","original_name":"Volker Rendschmidt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65abdfa398f1f10128df2e2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1608214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Axel Brand","original_name":"Axel Brand","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65abdf337d55040124d555e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1608178,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrea Hillen","original_name":"Andrea Hillen","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65abdf62d5191f00a030f097","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1608204,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dieter Hormel","original_name":"Dieter Hormel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65abdf6998f1f10125df2f92","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1570448,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ingrid Maye","original_name":"Ingrid Maye","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65abdf9472d85500c3442cd1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4490808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Die Tödliche Doris","original_name":"Die Tödliche Doris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65abdfc0be6d8800bd9290b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1280137,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Christoph Doering","original_name":"Christoph Doering","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65abdf5399d5c300bc7cd5c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1608189,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kiesel","original_name":"Kiesel","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65abdf77a843c100bcb6b7b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1608206,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georg Marioth","original_name":"Georg Marioth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65abdf7d7d55040126d551be","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1608198,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Notorische Reflexe","original_name":"Notorische Reflexe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65abdf9c98f1f10123df2fdc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":70605,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Manfred O.
