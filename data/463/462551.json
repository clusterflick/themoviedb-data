The film portrays Hermogenes, his wife Aurelia Kilpe, and their children in their Andean lifestyle, as well as Hermogenes' passion for painting, carving, building, and his devotion to the Virgin Mary.  Devout, austere and dedicated to craftsmanship, he can make anything from religious figures carved from cactus wood to a working harmonium. Inspired by a trip to Buenos Aires to advocate for land rights, Hermogenes has labored to replicate the style of the capital's grand cathedral and shrine to the Virgin with resourcefulness and skill.","popularity":0.3833,"poster_path":"/zTGIfPVaEVZrrDoR1zAzfCazVW1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"1969-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hermógenes Cayo (Imaginero)","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1835879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hermógenes Cayo","original_name":"Hermógenes Cayo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5947f458c3a368170f043e5d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1835881,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Isabel Franco","original_name":"Isabel Franco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5947f48cc3a36816c5042d27","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1279640,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Prelorán","original_name":"Jorge Prelorán","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5947f46d9251413fb104491a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1279640,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Prelorán","original_name":"Jorge Prelorán","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5947f4679251413fdd041554","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1835880,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leda Valladares","original_name":"Leda Valladares","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5947f47bc3a368265f021b19","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0191197","wikidata_id":"Q18223517","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zTGIfPVaEVZrrDoR1zAzfCazVW1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":208869,"name":"etnography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
