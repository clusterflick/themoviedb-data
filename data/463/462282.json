In her documentary film The Screen Painters, she sets her sights on a much-loved Baltimore icon: the painted window screen and the artists who created them. This delightful documentary film chronicles the beginnings, the heyday, and the decline of an urban folk art unique to Baltimore -- the practice of painting landscape scenes on window and door screens. It profiles seven artists who have spent much of their lives embellishing the bricks and stones of the inner city with a touch of enchantment. The film reveals how this unpretentious art form embodies the ethnic spirit of urban America and is a testament to the need for art in daily life. -Direct Cinema Limited","popularity":0.3714,"poster_path":"/ZsVg5RirP9WSMZla2OjiuokD6r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91472,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Painted Screen Society of Baltimore, Maryland, Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1988-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Chronicles the beginnings, heyday, and decline of the practices of painting landscape scenes on window and door screens.","title":"The Screen Painters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1834857,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elaine Eff","original_name":"Elaine Eff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"594551959251413fdd01285f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1834857,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elaine Eff","original_name":"Elaine Eff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5945519f9251413fc2012217","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ZsVg5RirP9WSMZla2OjiuokD6r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":532}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2672,"name":"baltimore, usa"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
