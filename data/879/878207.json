There are more than 80,000 wild horses on our federal lands and more than 50,000 in holding facilities. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist David Philipps says, \"The wild horse is so ingrained in the American imagination that even for those who have never seen one know what it stands for: fierce independence, unbridled freedom, the bedrock ideals of the nation. From car ads to high school mascots, the wild horse - popularly known as the mustang - is the enduring icon of America. But in modern times it has become entangled in controversy and bureaucracy, and now its future is in question.\" Whether you are a horse person or not, this film will make you fall in love with America all over again.","popularity":0.5547,"poster_path":"/nAyIIm7qDjhtJr1lULSHtWx7Qmt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161532,"logo_path":null,"name":"Steven Latham
