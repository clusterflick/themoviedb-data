Uh... What's Her Name","overview":"On February 4, 1974, the Symbionese Liberation Army kidnapped newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst.  A month later, SLA members and Hearst robbed a bank in San Francisco.  After the telecast shootout with police in Los Angeles, two remaining SLA members and Hearst fled to rural Pennsylvania, where they met Wendy Yoshimura.  Wendy was eluding authorities who had indicted her on weapons and explosives charges in 1972. After 3 years on the run, Wendy was captured with Hearst in a San Francisco apartment, where the FBI threatened to \"blow Wendy's head off\".  She was kept in isolation for 40 days, then jailed for 3 months until the Wendy Yoshimura Fair Trial Committee came to her aid.","popularity":0.3003,"poster_path":"/kL8ZMrCEt95TGylXo1W29dicFfq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wendy...
