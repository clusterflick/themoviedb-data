We view these actions while thinking about the places in which they take place; this work was recorded in the artist’s bedroom. Rituals brings the viewer into an environment of immersive intimacy, exploring the complex interplay between independence and interdependence.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rituals","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2548822,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Deborah Findlater","original_name":"Deborah Findlater","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6150f9f91c635b0063f5ce6e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
