While Harahan’s films have taken a number of different forms, this grouping focuses on his observational documentaries, recorded on video cameras shooting through the windows of various places he lived in North Belfast across those years. The films capture found activity, natural and built environments, the animal world and human unpredictability. The visual layer of the films are then married to new (primarily musical) soundtracks which serve to dislocate the films from the realm of pure recording to something more complex and ambiguous, the intersection of inner and outer realities.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"There's A Weight On You But You Can't Feel It","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1545340,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Seamus Harahan","original_name":"Seamus Harahan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6150f248211ce5008f7f4b4e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
