For over ten years, 48-year-old Iraqi War Veteran and machinist Christian Yingling has commanded a troop of private militiamen and women concerned with the government’s infringement on their constitutional rights. The group practices paramilitary drills, stockpiles food and ammo, and attends gun rights rallies in preparation for a doomsday scenario. Now that a worldwide pandemic has hit, followed by a summer of racial injustice protests and a Presidential election like no other, Christian—out of work and nearly out of money—must confront his allegiance and choose to act or not.","popularity":0.0779,"poster_path":"/3eX11fuZVj863f687IaWzNyi57j.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":214721,"logo_path":"/rAHCszG70SkJnlnoNW5FoZ7Kx8s.png","name":"Columbia Journalism
