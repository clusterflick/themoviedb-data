Featuring testimonies from Black womxn all over the country, the stories of family, friends, friends-of-friends, and acquaintances from varying backgrounds and age groups are intricately woven together. The film is formed from a series of unstructured and conversational kitchen table interviews about societal perceptions on Black womxn as racialised bodies. Through these conversations, the fragments of positive and negative encounters and experiences – and the rainbow of emotions expressed – create a story of vulnerability, pain and joy that is at once liberatory and heartbreaking.","popularity":0.0243,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2997826,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Beverley Bennett","original_name":"Beverley Bennett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61505f24140bad0061aa4f07","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
