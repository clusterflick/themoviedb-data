The film is a realistic depiction of addiction and how there is no magic cure.  The vicious cycle of progress and defeat tumbles the family of Panthoi (played by Priyakanta Laishram) through many years in this film chronicle. It also depicts the relationship of a drug addict with his loved ones that's pushed to the limits by a seemingly no-win situation. A meditation on memory and the difficulty of reconciling the happiness of the past with a present that's become too sad to bear. The film won 5 awards and 15 nominations including Best Actor In A Leading Role for Priyakanta, Best Narration, Best Screenplay etc. at various international and national film festivals.","popularity":0.3111,"poster_path":"/u9K0irWFtVRj5VHKZPDh9AvXbpI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161570,"logo_path":null,"name":"Priyakanta Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-01","revenue":47467,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Seek The Light, Find A Way.","title":"Spaced Out -
