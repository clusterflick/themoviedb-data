A history of conflict, etched within the building’s material structure, plays out in episodes of companionship, obsession, murder and destruction. The work actively seeks to diminish the importance of Le Corbusier within this narrative, whose obsessive relationship with Gray’s villa is encaptured in his vandalistic murals that were painted directly onto the walls of the house.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"E.1027","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2219625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Smith","original_name":"Sam Smith","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/61eh2k7eSOaHrkSU42kqEllPNLo.jpg","credit_id":"6150b9fde8a3e10043fc64a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Whitechapel Gallery","release_date":"2016-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Sheffield Doc/Fest","release_date":"2021-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
