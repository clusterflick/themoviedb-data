This moment took place within the opening of the Thames River police unit (known as the advent of preventive policing), a department of a shipping company (West India Committee) commissioned to prevent loss in their inventory. The film performs a motion-study of the \"double-shot\" that Forrester witnessed, through studying the motion of property title, as a trajectory of exchange. The physics of \"Work\" (Force x Distance), frames the historical moment in which a wage per time unit was introduced by the Thames River Police, to replace the dock-workers' traditional wage system.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joules","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1967295,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ash Moniz","original_name":"Ash Moniz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6150681b2d8ef3002a9bd14d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
