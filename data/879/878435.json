Two characters talk about how to inhabit the territory. Their discussion seems to resonate with the landscape of brutalist and industrial ruins that surrounds them. A tension arises, between doubts and questions about their vision of the future. In contrast to the fatalism of one, the other argues that the ruins are a shelter for organising a common life and breaking the cycle of political disillusionment. Oscillating between cinema of the real and futuristic speculation, the work leads us into a poetic and political reflection on the mutations of the world.","popularity":0.0347,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The School of Mutants","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3248793,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stéphane Verlet-Bottéro","original_name":"Stéphane Verlet-Bottéro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6150f3410582240063f3c6e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2871432,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hamedine Kane","original_name":"Hamedine Kane","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6150f34b67dcc9002a61148d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
