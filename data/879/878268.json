A self-taught filmmaker, Salmon began filming his neighbourhood in Brixton in 1959. His unique archive of Super 8 celluloid films includes church and community events, activism, local struggles and the aftermath of the 1981 Brixton Riots. Clovis Salmon was born in Jamaica in 1930, and was among the first generation of migrants from the West Indies to settle in the United Kingdom, arriving in London in November 1954. Having run his own bike shop in Jamaica, he joined Holdsworth Cycle Co. as a bicycle repair man, and soon became known as ‘Sam the Wheels’.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Great Conflict, Brixton Riots & Other Films","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1800670,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clovis Salmon","original_name":"Clovis Salmon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615058a6158c85002c4c9a33","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
