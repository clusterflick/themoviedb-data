The boys appear with Steve Allen, Ed Wynn, and original front man Ted Healy as bungling barbers, clueless cowboys, goofy golfers, bumbling beach bums, witless witnesses, hare-brained house cleaners, and more.  You'll split your sides when you see Curly as a jumbo jockey who can't mount a horse, Shemp as a ghostly do-gooder determined to reform his partners, and Curly Joe as a near-sighted knife-thrower menacing Larry.","popularity":0.4744,"poster_path":"/ideuXrNiHZz6Kg4PWCzdbZ5XjET.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12313,"logo_path":"/1GUIuC1Pjk0oOWJuaS42zb9NF43.png","name":"GoodTimes Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Three Stooges: Kings Of Laughter","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moe Howard","original_name":"Moe Howard","popularity":0.6107,"profile_path":"/93l6M2P42vracu6cfzuOqmYBYk1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Moe","credit_id":"6211487a41465c006c5f0109","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Fine","original_name":"Larry Fine","popularity":0.3206,"profile_path":"/zdT16UWESRhhT48KGeXibmQzslQ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Larry","credit_id":"6211489c396e97001bbc9026","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89614,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Curly Howard","original_name":"Curly Howard","popularity":0.2883,"profile_path":"/ozWdyoTNqWy55bOglIFqR4ZalwZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Curly","credit_id":"621148a53e2ec8001b6be6a5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe DeRita","original_name":"Joe DeRita","popularity":0.1895,"profile_path":"/cQHAGZuAxtOtQi7bnLvsWIhABLc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Joe","credit_id":"621148baa39d0b001b3e2cda","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13967,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shemp Howard","original_name":"Shemp Howard","popularity":0.1693,"profile_path":"/b6L3kV2qnputHSsd7uYirjKEMBC.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Shemp","credit_id":"621148d09f1be700710a4f59","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emil Sitka","original_name":"Emil Sitka","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":"/hsSU6n8qZTOYNvj2t27ArQIfF1r.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"621149319f1be70020255c29","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Besser","original_name":"Joe Besser","popularity":0.2981,"profile_path":"/A2pHRTtPh9CqQlXD5omN0TJ5yhc.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6211493e44a424006c651796","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bud Jamison","original_name":"Bud Jamison","popularity":0.1662,"profile_path":"/AiiqQpcsDraQqYxkKwwKHmCU0QE.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"621149d041465c006c5f04b6","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":970532,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ken Cayre","original_name":"Ken Cayre","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62114aa289b561001b7c6f29","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1365844,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sandy Oliveri","original_name":"Sandy Oliveri","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62114a7720e6a500683f99cd","department":"Production","job":"Other"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":970531,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stan Cayre","original_name":"Stan Cayre","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62114abe96670e00417c919b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":970533,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joe Cayre","original_name":"Joe Cayre","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62114ab0396e970042c600ff","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434110,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Catherine Ibsen","original_name":"Catherine Ibsen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62114ae24c2592001bc40920","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":970532,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ken Cayre","original_name":"Ken Cayre","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62114a8b1f02750042798699","department":"Crew","job":"Creative Consultant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ideuXrNiHZz6Kg4PWCzdbZ5XjET.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
