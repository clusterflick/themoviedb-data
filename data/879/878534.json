Their plight is overshadowed by the invasive but agriculturally significant honeybees. “Save the Bee” campaigns have grown in popularity, but they focus on domesticated honeybees, while the native bees, so critical to our ecosystems are lacking conservation attention. This film explores the tension between efforts to save native bees and their habitat and our dependence on the invasive honeybees.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/iOasFghkHimS9Rkh031N4DJjsVm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Buzz Kill","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1726988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dr. Sam Droege","original_name":"Dr. Sam Droege","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"61513a5493828e0093679db7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lindsay Barranco","original_name":"Lindsay Barranco","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"61513a5b3a4a1200920addd2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249196,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brooke McDonough","original_name":"Brooke McDonough","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61513a64140bad00253ede90","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"brooke_mcdonough","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iOasFghkHimS9Rkh031N4DJjsVm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
