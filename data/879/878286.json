Dreyfus","overview":"Self-taught magician, transformist at the Grande Eugène cabaret, man of theater, television and cinema, Jean-Claude D. Dreyfus has been dragging his inimitable drawl wherever he wants. Able to play the Diva for Michel Audiard as well as for Werner Herzog. Loubard one day for Gilles Béhat and Duke of Orleans the next day for Rohmer. We often met him with Mocky or Boisset, more mysteriously with Tommy Chong and remains permanently anchored in our memories thanks to his performance in Delicatessen or Marie's ads, depending on the genre. Jean-Claude D. Dreyfus is one of those marginal people, adventurers a bit crazy, often poet and above all a bon vivant, in short, a species on the way to extinction. The directors wanted to meet the character and remember  this extravagant little life.","popularity":0.4649,"poster_path":"/bIcR4zXAU2UaOVsDGHgsmpUQCPx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Extravagant Little Life of Jean-Claude D.
