After being sentenced to several years in juvenile prison for negligent homicide, Paul is released on parole. Insecure and aimless, the introverted loner tries to regain his footing in the world outside. To reintegrate into society, he has been offered a temporary job as a night watchman at a local university until he finds a permanent training position. Paul spends his nights alone in the empty hallways and lecture halls of the university, longing to make friends. He is repeatedly haunted at night by traumatic memories and panic attacks. When Paul meets a group of students at a party, everything finally seems to improve. For the first time in a long time, Paul has the opportunity to make friends again and leave his old life behind. But the demons of his past do not let him rest.","popularity":0.135,"poster_path":"/uhVMxydXVmbU7bt2zq0s17VaCI7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nightwatch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1820950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justus Johanssen","original_name":"Justus Johanssen","popularity":0.0652,"profile_path":"/uKOVnWsEyZyD79EyR6emWe0JQid.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Paul","credit_id":"6150dafae10f4600436cdcfb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1815522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roman Schomburg","original_name":"Roman Schomburg","popularity":0.2006,"profile_path":"/jsQ0EtEt7tjiunBNumfzGgYPS69.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ben","credit_id":"6150db17af95900026ffac49","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3248711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christoph Hofmann","original_name":"Christoph Hofmann","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":"/vnQ6eHhD3CRzpYglFZfUnlfWsAd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Günay","credit_id":"6150db9fa5d849002b0bc536","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1718744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moritz Constantin","original_name":"Moritz Constantin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6372d0c521621b009113caaa","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3786253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yves Zahnd","original_name":"Yves Zahnd","popularity":0.0713,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6372d0cd6bdec3007d9ffd90","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3639646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beate Weidenhammer","original_name":"Beate Weidenhammer","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6372d0d72b1b440078941aa4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3786254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Riccardo Giagnorio","original_name":"Riccardo Giagnorio","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6372d0e1bf0f63007fe4f8bb","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3786256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manot Böhm","original_name":"Manot Böhm","popularity":0.0828,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"6372d0f86bdec3007a43aee3","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2159036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Skoda","original_name":"Martin Skoda","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/r8oMv1yfv5KDV0k7paRNbW48osZ.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"6372d10002842000b44d9743","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3248716,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joachim Neef","original_name":"Joachim Neef","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6150dd46211ce5008f7f1fc1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3248716,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joachim Neef","original_name":"Joachim Neef","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6150dd57af95900061a7bd0b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3248717,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stefanos Dimitriadis","original_name":"Stefanos Dimitriadis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6150dd701c635b002a0eec22","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15432818","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1074,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jCSgbCcwObL7HpGgMG08Hvylfs3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1909},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1074,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pY48wJASpyg8x25axGSJncgg4Qa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1909},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":724,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r8LQll3kwjZQDvHMF4NXubDeMmb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1287}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uhVMxydXVmbU7bt2zq0s17VaCI7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
