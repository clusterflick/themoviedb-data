All three witnessed a tragic fate in an atmosphere of general indifference.","popularity":0.0626,"poster_path":"/62Mutz2tSymYrkqbGFTQQgDSDsg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91911,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nouveau Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thirty","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3113274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ali Jaziri","original_name":"Ali Jaziri","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Tahar Haddad","credit_id":"61521277e18b97002c37acff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3250126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maher El Hefidhi","original_name":"Maher El Hefidhi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Abou el Kacem Chebbi","credit_id":"615212ad1c635b00447173cd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3250127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walid Nahdi","original_name":"Walid Nahdi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ali Douagi","credit_id":"615212c167dcc90043df315a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3250128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rami Afana","original_name":"Rami Afana","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Mohamed Ali El Hammi","credit_id":"615212d443d9b10062304987","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1821825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ghanem Zrelli","original_name":"Ghanem Zrelli","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Habib Bourguiba","credit_id":"615212f09974ee0043eda4a0","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1433176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fadhel Jaziri","original_name":"Fadhel Jaziri","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615211ad9f5dfb0029f39921","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1433176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fadhel Jaziri","original_name":"Fadhel Jaziri","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61521318af9590008e6401e3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3250129,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Aroussia Nalouti","original_name":"Aroussia Nalouti","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61521333e18b970042e0cd99","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9345114","wikidata_id":"Q3519449","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/62Mutz2tSymYrkqbGFTQQgDSDsg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"2008-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
