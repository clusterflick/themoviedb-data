It is an experience that most of us have had, at some time or another. Even if we have not, it is not difficult to imagine. For we all carry around with us a mental databank of generic images of the world that surrounds us, fed by popular culture and the mass media as much as by direct experience. Tunnel is intended to evoke the idea or the memory of such a journey, rather than to simulate the experience of any actual event. It is closer in feeling to the images that form in the mind while dreaming, or when thinking about what it might be like to travel through an underpass, for instance.","popularity":0.0486,"poster_path":"/Ams9ZPFN66psGVBg2ENgSNq5cNI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tunnel","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3250895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Demand","original_name":"Thomas Demand","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6152e6410582240044a90453","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Ams9ZPFN66psGVBg2ENgSNq5cNI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
