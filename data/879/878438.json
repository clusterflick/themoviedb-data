Using the extended metaphor of a house in woeful disrepair, the filmmaker grapples with the shocks and reverberations of state violence.

Challenging his own engagement with collective protest, and the temptation to give in to feelings of middle-class apathy ingrained through one’s upbringing, the filmmaker continually plays on the dichotomy of outside and inside. “The ‘truth’ of the outside world has now entered our house and now lives inside our own ‘reality’; a horrific concoction.”","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Turmoil","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2777269,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anuj Malhotra","original_name":"Anuj Malhotra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6150f3b3af95900043066230","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
