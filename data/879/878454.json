We are talking about a new world in which plants and technology dominate, where we can finally know what a plant has to say. After all human life has disappeared from Earth, a bored artificial intuition connects to non-human life. A plant is having a recurring dream about a 'last observer' and recounts this strange dream in a dystopian narrative. All the components of the film take us on a journey through time. The pairing of the images of a speculative future shot with Super 8, a format from the past, creates a contemplative and rather endearing environment that throws us directly into reflections around artificial intelligence, anthropocentrism, and self projections.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/vMGKiRsPlIRx9adjFjsKjycqNjC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Observer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3248831,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lina Laraki","original_name":"Lina Laraki","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6150fb509c97bd0042247f4f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1890,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vMGKiRsPlIRx9adjFjsKjycqNjC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1417},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1890,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fohSPz3eIL0hQVEx3nybu3KLkJE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1417}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
