This sequence is then divided and rearranged 7 times in reverse order. Each time the divisions are greater in number (smaller in size) until finally the film appears to move smoothly backwards, divided by a single frame. The inspiration for the film as well as the title is derived from information theory where a 'moment' is defined as the shortest duration at which no distinction can be made between units of information. This work is a demonstration and exploration of the line between human information and machine information. It dynamically reveals film's basic unit, the frame.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/plTRmF3SrWg3lHrA4IcEmuPetwg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1972-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moment","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2191503,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Brand","original_name":"Bill Brand","popularity":0.099,"profile_path":"/v8PHkZsZG24XJUZWQCv7RMecuP8.jpg","credit_id":"61507a6d67203d002969f473","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2191503,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Brand","original_name":"Bill Brand","popularity":0.099,"profile_path":"/v8PHkZsZG24XJUZWQCv7RMecuP8.jpg","credit_id":"61507a9f2d8ef300626cfd32","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2025617","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/plTRmF3SrWg3lHrA4IcEmuPetwg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Filmmakers Co-Op","release_date":"1972-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
