The piece journeys through Minott's personal diasporic journey and takes the moment of Windrush Day to focus on those that move and have been moved, those who stay and cannot leave, and all of the slippage in between. Shifting between personal and community moments of loss and joy that sit at the border, Minott hopes this work can add to a conversation about these experiences.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fi Dem","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2415367,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zinzi Minott","original_name":"Zinzi Minott","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61505c7ac3514c006292802d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
