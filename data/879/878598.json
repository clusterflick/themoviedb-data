At the beginning of the 20th century, Olena Shovgenova, the daughter of a famous Russian scientist (and later the famous Ukrainian poetess Olena Teliha), found herself with her family in Kyiv, where she fell in love for the first time, but was forced to leave the city and her lover. In Czechoslovakia, the future poetess reveals a shocking fact - Ukrainian culture lives in exile. Here she falls in love with the Cossack Mykhailo Teliha, with whom she later moves to Warsaw. But the desire to return to her beloved Kyiv does not leave Olena.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/kB1OVctwheMrGDJl2m4OdZ2YSkR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2021-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Butterfly Dance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249559,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malvina Saliychuk","original_name":"Malvina Saliychuk","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Olena Teliga","credit_id":"61518ba2158c85008b472036","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kiril Nikolaev","original_name":"Kiril Nikolaev","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mykhailo Teliga","credit_id":"61518b7caf959000260134f8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3249558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dmytro Oliinyk","original_name":"Дмитро Олійник","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":"/ilNur4b9S1DVMxN8T3VYesJY9kF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ulas Samchuk","credit_id":"61518b8fe18b97008c925562","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249556,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arsenii Bortnyk","original_name":"Arsenii Bortnyk","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/cNQsKiQloKcqg6FNjE10aru5m1F.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Oleg Olzhych","credit_id":"61518b6ae18b97002c36ae92","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249561,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariia Felenko","original_name":"Mariia Felenko","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61518bd467dcc9008ce6098f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249562,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bohdan Novikov","original_name":"Bohdan Novikov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61518be69974ee0043ecb15a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249561,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariia Felenko","original_name":"Mariia Felenko","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61518bcbe18b97002c36aedc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15501204","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"tanokmetelyka","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kB1OVctwheMrGDJl2m4OdZ2YSkR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Korona Karpat Truskavets International Film Festival","release_date":"2021-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
