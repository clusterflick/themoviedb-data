The “songs” are seven as the principal stars of the Ursa Major. It will be a nocturnal wandering with the starry sky as a reference: an earthly pilgrimage looking for epiphanies or the drift of a hypothetical interstellar trip.","popularity":0.0723,"poster_path":"/7mKITNC9JXBvXXoIF7D2c4QtZeH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Vaghe Stelle (5)","title":"Dubhe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Vaghe Stelle","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1185176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mauro Santini","original_name":"Mauro Santini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/k3O0zMbxxDfqVagmjo138Auyzqo.jpg","credit_id":"615227d363a6950061c7bbec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7mKITNC9JXBvXXoIF7D2c4QtZeH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
