Kwon imagines virtual space as a utopian realm where one can reimagine and revisualise the past. Through the body of a nude 3D avatar, she travels back to her childhood home, stepping inside home video taken by her father of family gatherings long ago. There she faces patriarchal family rituals and coercive religious rituals that she didn’t notice when she was young, and interrupts them with her avatar. On the soundtrack, we hear the repetitive rhythm of traditional ironing sticks hitting stone, used both a metaphor for the invisible labour of Korean women, and as a sound of healing and catharsis.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Ritual for Metamorphosis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3248791,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heesoo Kwon","original_name":"Heesoo Kwon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6150f2a5af95900061a7ef97","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
