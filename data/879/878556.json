Over twenty years ago, a father failed precisely to do that, hence language plays a role in the relationship with his son. A rapper with Carinthian and American roots shows how he overcomes minority identities, whereas a theater professional calls on politicians to finally give space to the Slovene language, culture & identity in Austria. Still Koroška is a short documentary about the many ways of being Carinthian-Slovenian, about the loss of language and the desire not to lose it amongst linguistic minorities.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/vCXt402fNPyFsJyPRHUKuWy9Zbf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":215745,"logo_path":null,"name":"HENX OG","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2021-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Still Koroška","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249292,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nils Kaltschmidt","original_name":"Nils Kaltschmidt","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61514d619c97bd00611eb729","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249298,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Fabio Schurischuster","original_name":"Fabio Schurischuster","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61514d98e10f46008c148a85","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249294,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Günter Schilhan","original_name":"Günter Schilhan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61514d733a4a1200920b04c9","department":"Writing","job":"Story Consultant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249291,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katharina Brunner","original_name":"Katharina Brunner","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61514d11f04d010063ce05de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249292,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nils Kaltschmidt","original_name":"Nils Kaltschmidt","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61514d1dfb834600433af7eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249292,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nils Kaltschmidt","original_name":"Nils Kaltschmidt","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61514d309974ee00629f63fe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1144094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent Seidle","original_name":"Vincent Seidle","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61514d39e18b9700628987a2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249292,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nils Kaltschmidt","original_name":"Nils Kaltschmidt","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61514d45e10f4600436dd687","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249292,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nils Kaltschmidt","original_name":"Nils Kaltschmidt","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61514d50a5d849008dfa0f86","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249295,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Selina May","original_name":"Selina May","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61514d810582240022bcb74c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249296,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Markus Seereiter","original_name":"Markus Seereiter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61514d8aa5d849006264e4fc","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249291,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katharina Brunner","original_name":"Katharina Brunner","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61514d289c97bd008a07c84a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249299,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andreas Wittmann-Fauler","original_name":"Andreas Wittmann-Fauler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61514da2f04d010063ce069f","department":"Production","job":"Accountant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vCXt402fNPyFsJyPRHUKuWy9Zbf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":565}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
