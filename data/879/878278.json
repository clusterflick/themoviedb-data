The film takes the form of a moving image essay that speaks to the problem of spectacle for Black subjects on-screen. It features 900 abstracted still archival images that span the African diaspora, both spatially and temporally, accompanied by a text that references thinkers Tina Campt, Saidiya Hartman, Guy Debord, Frank B. Wilderson III, Ruun Nuur, Susan Sontag and more.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"where did we land","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2511200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rabz Lansiquot","original_name":"Rabz Lansiquot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61505ce7fb8346008cd1e6fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
