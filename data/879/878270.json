We are honoured to show Stationary Peaceful Protest, an animated film by jazz musician and composer Xhosa Cole and Birmingham based animator Shiyi Li, as it looks at Xhosaâ€™s experiences of attending a BLM protest in Birmingham. It inspired him to pen a monologue about his thoughts on his own personal experience of the occasion. Intertwining his own music into a recording of the monologue, he then collaborated with Birmingham-based animator Shiyi Li - the two of them then worked together to produce a beguiling, free-flowing, and absorbing short film which is both powerful and evocative.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stationary Peaceful Protest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3248139,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shiyi Li","original_name":"Shiyi Li","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6150599967dcc9002a5fbb88","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3248138,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xhosa Cole","original_name":"Xhosa Cole","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61505991fb8346004338b607","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
