The only human interactions she has are in her dreams and with her caretaker, her father, when he brings her meals. One day her cycle is broken by chance and Tuyen has to decide if she will face the outside world again.  The Hikikomori are a growing, world wide phenomenon - but still largely unknown to society. The current pandemic will likely accelerate their numbers and this film aims to make them more known to the general public.","popularity":0.0361,"poster_path":"/nW7HQkKgyw7QvPcojeHdS9DvLf3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aberration","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marque Pham","original_name":"Marque Pham","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Tuyen","credit_id":"615129fb1c635b00446feff3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249143,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Carlos Laux y Silió","original_name":"Carlos Laux y Silió","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61512a6ee10f46008c142b91","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249142,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roxane Llanque","original_name":"Roxane Llanque","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61512a0baf95900026008833","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249142,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roxane Llanque","original_name":"Roxane Llanque","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61512a15a5d849006264917d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3249142,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roxane Llanque","original_name":"Roxane Llanque","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61512a52af95900061a88217","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13825866","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nW7HQkKgyw7QvPcojeHdS9DvLf3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Madrid Human Rights Film Festival 2020 -Semi-Finalist Short Film, Madrid","release_date":"2020-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
