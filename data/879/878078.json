Some of his innovations hold promise for sustainable living, while others - like his ice museum and airplane on stilts - are just weird.\r \"Never Had a Bad Day\" follows him as he prepares for his annual Energy Fair, a symposium that attracts high-level politicians, high-power academics and hundreds of guests. Along the way, we learn how Bernieâ€™s brothers with disabilities inspire him, how he came to live in Alaska, and how he came to his belief that literally anything is possible if you work hard enough.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":"/rj7CzUfZfrVsfX27rmZani9YZU9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Never Had a Bad Day: The Legend of Bernie Karl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3247476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernie Karl","original_name":"Bernie Karl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"614f76c3140bad00253b1868","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3247477,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Richmond","original_name":"Matt Richmond","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614f76eb140bad004302a7f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3247478,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Jake Beyhl","original_name":"Jake Beyhl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614f772aa5d8490043246876","department":"Art","job":"Creative Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3247479,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jake Beyhl","original_name":"Jake Beyhl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614f7773e8a3e1002c03fd24","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3247480,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jon Michael Ryan","original_name":"Jon Michael Ryan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614f778ec3514c006290a583","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3247481,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sarah Mcdonnell","original_name":"Sarah Mcdonnell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614f77a467dcc90043d9dfed","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3247482,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chad Weber","original_name":"Chad Weber","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/oOeBfClk557baJox6ksaD2vDWYH.jpg","credit_id":"614f77b8c3514c006290a5d6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":1599,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rj7CzUfZfrVsfX27rmZani9YZU9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1201}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
