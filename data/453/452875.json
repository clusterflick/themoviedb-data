The filmmaker questions the past and present of Abitibi and draws up, face to face, the promises of colonization in the 1930s and the great disappointment caused by the closing of the land in the 1970s. There are witnesses to the heroic era, including the cultivator Hauris Lalancette, as well as extracts from films by Father Maurice Proulx (1934-1940).","popularity":0.3559,"poster_path":"/5gPbsAWiexrzSXm8NlLJ53nsUMS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Back to the Land","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1560887,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gilles Quintal","original_name":"Gilles Quintal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f6d179c3a368415e0058d0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168431,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Louise Carré","original_name":"Louise Carré","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f6d2559251415dfe005a60","department":"Production","job":"Administration"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1265097,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bernard Gosselin","original_name":"Bernard Gosselin","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f6cfa39251415e02005bf9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1296915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serge Giguère","original_name":"Serge Giguère","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f6d039c3a36841b0005957","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Technician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1798853,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Claire Boyer","original_name":"Claire Boyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f6cfb1c3a36841e8005847","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1197111,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Claude Beaugrand","original_name":"Claude Beaugrand","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f6d1289251415e02005ccc","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1798857,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hugues Mignault","original_name":"Hugues Mignault","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f6d077c3a36841d3005fc1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1798859,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roseline Breton","original_name":"Roseline Breton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f6d2229251415dfe005a4c","department":"Production","job":"Administration"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1650083,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Larose","original_name":"Paul Larose","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f6d27a9251415df0005c98","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1354861,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Pierre Joutel","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Joutel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f6d203c3a368416d005db5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":38519,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Monique Létourneau","original_name":"Monique Létourneau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f6d2679251415df0005c88","department":"Production","job":"Administration"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Perrault","original_name":"Pierre Perrault","popularity":0.1019,"profile_path":"/c8Vwck8Mvpgl3hLvHbnmwjjbjGo.jpg","credit_id":"5d6c00105f2db1000d517a83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0209277","wikidata_id":"Q3226447","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":954,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5gPbsAWiexrzSXm8NlLJ53nsUMS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":636}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":225532,"name":"quebec direct cinema"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
