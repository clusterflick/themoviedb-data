The trickle-down ‘Rogernomics’ rhetoric warned of no gain without pain, and here the theory is counterpointed by the social effects (redundant workers, Post Office closures). Made by Alister Barry in 1996 when the effects were raw, the film draws extensively on archive footage and interviews with key “witnesses to history”.","popularity":0.1372,"poster_path":"/jgV7XsiTHsQJS5y3YD8trbJTlNT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":614,"logo_path":"/3pP50VnBQPVjstomuCnCvUGgsfP.png","name":"Vanguard Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"1996-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Someone Else's Country","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alister Barry","original_name":"Alister Barry","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f5d46cc3a3680e8a00a57b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alister Barry","original_name":"Alister Barry","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f5d47ec3a3680e9800ac53","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shane Loader","original_name":"Shane Loader","popularity":0.0996,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f5d49ac3a3680e6e0098eb","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/miFGgeHwI8NYoHffqnavQwuEHG8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jgV7XsiTHsQJS5y3YD8trbJTlNT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":532}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":2658,"name":"new zealand"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1996-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
