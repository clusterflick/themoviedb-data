Paradoxically, this attempt to incorporate Luxembourg into the Third Reich triggered the nation's self-awareness. Using mostly unseen archive footage, the film tells the story of the clash between ideologies: the Nazi vision of a 'German' Luxembourg, colliding violently with the idea of an independent Grand Duchy. For a people who where becoming aware of their national identity, this was a huge cultural shock. The emotional backbone of the film rests on the many testimonies of the people who lived through that tragic period.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/bEa4x5fQfEEWjGyIopKbGMPlTZM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Letzeburgesch","iso_639_1":"lb","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heim ins Reich","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"LU","title":"Heim ins Reich - Wéi Lëtzebuerg sollt preisesch ginn","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Heim ins Reich - l'échec d'une annexion","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Heim ins Reich - der misslungene Anschluss","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Heim ins Reich - the failed take-over","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1798566,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Claude Lahr","original_name":"Claude Lahr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/fSuA3GlJPtjzaWuuFMNSf1eaWIp.jpg","credit_id":"58f61af7c3a3680e6e00bbd3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1798566,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Claude Lahr","original_name":"Claude Lahr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/fSuA3GlJPtjzaWuuFMNSf1eaWIp.jpg","credit_id":"58f61b0b92514127a600cffb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0439604","wikidata_id":"Q1595504","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.776,"height":732,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u8kgLfW4LvOb05tJ3wsFd0mSSwB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1300}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2088,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bEa4x5fQfEEWjGyIopKbGMPlTZM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1392}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"lb","note":"","release_date":"2004-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
