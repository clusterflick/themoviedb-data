At home, they discuss the meeting until after Norma, the elder daughter has returned from a night of pleasure. Norma ridicules the thought of revivals. Being tired and emotionally disturbed, she gets to her room, falls across her bed and is soon asleep and dreaming. An angel appears and talks to her. In the dream the Rapture of the Church takes place.","popularity":0.366,"poster_path":"/eG6EavapKi4Aes8s6DXHb37NLSi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89023,"logo_path":null,"name":"Evangel Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1946-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Tomorrow's event today!","title":"The Missing Christians","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1798078,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manford Evans","original_name":"Manford Evans","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f4eefe9251411029000080","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1798081,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"William Zehr","original_name":"William Zehr","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f4ef2e925141100c0000d5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1798079,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"L.
