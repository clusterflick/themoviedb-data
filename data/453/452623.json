The \"Pittuiti\", on the other hand, are gypsies camping out in the suburbs. Young Zita belongs to the tribe and meets Théo Védrines, the publisher's son, a wild seducer. Zita is soon forced to tell her family that she is expecting a child. A scandal for the Pittuiti family, who instruct Zita's brother to apply the law of retaliation, Bruno must in turn seduce the pleasant Gisèle Védrines. And why not? But while Théo gradually becomes an anarchist, Bruno becomes more and more embourgeoise as Védrines discovers in him a real talent for writing. Still, Bruno and Gisèle will be as happy as Théo and Zita ever were.","popularity":0.3783,"poster_path":"/phrDT4vKdTXNHS10FwsqXoEjhaH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107961,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films de la
