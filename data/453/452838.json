Real-life 'Pan Am girls' recall a high-life of luxury and glamour; rubbing shoulders with celebrity passengers, international romances and having to wear the now infamous girdle. Stars of the Jet Age such as Robert Vaughn and Mary Quant remember the food, fashion and girls that made them regular Pan Am passengers. Pan Am's success was largely due to its visionary founder Juan Trippe, who transformed a small mail carrier into a global airline, pioneered flights for the masses and helped create the Boeing 747 jumbo jet. Honor Blackman narrates the story of how Pan Am conquered the skies and left a legacy of affordable travel and a much smaller world.","popularity":0.3576,"poster_path":"/ib4WmY79sKUO5YdVhgnITVfVtyb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160854,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pier Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Come Fly With Me: The Story of Pan Am","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9907,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Honor Blackman","original_name":"Honor Blackman","popularity":0.7515,"profile_path":"/2AGVWf7orxXvgcssUWdonX1yKvm.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"613e2bc06af9dd006688e588","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421158,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Lennhoff","original_name":"Stephen Lennhoff","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613e2b8e0cd32a008d7f4f80","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421158,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Lennhoff","original_name":"Stephen Lennhoff","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613e2b990cd32a0043e4809d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2175603","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ib4WmY79sKUO5YdVhgnITVfVtyb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
