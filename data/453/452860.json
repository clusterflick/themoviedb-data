Starting at a picnic by the lakeside in Chicago, this famous film transports us to the outer edges of the universe. Every ten seconds we view the starting point from ten times farther out, until our own galaxy is visible only as a speck of light among many others. Returning to earth with breathtaking speed, we move inward--into the hand of the sleeping picnicker--with ten times more magnification every ten seconds. Our journey ends inside a proton of a carbon atom within a DNA molecule in a white blood cell.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/lb9P3zgnmnAlVRiPFM8hYVwhZMj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Films of Charles & Ray Eames, Vol. 1: The Powers of 10","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lb9P3zgnmnAlVRiPFM8hYVwhZMj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2000-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
