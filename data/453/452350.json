Pini charts the impact of Sparks on his life while meeting with fellow Sparks fans, among them famous musicians, in Tel Aviv, London, Berlin, Rotterdam and NYC. Structured as a personal quest of the filmmaker to prove that Sparks are the coolest underrated band in the history of popular music, this docu-comedy explores the universal themes of growing old and being an outsider, the importance of art in daily life and the power of non-conformism.","popularity":0.3919,"poster_path":"/14sKtspibmxYv1qk8gz6pJQLEVV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160686,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vice Versa
