Shrum and his band, the Rhythm Rangers, are warned away from playing a theater in Big Bend by Cal's brother, Walt Shrum and his Colorado Hillbillies. Ignoring the warning, the Rhythm Rangers arrive at the theater only to be shot at by a masked stranger. With the help of stranded vaudeville performer Max \"Alibi\" Terhune and his dummy Elmer, Cal manages to catch the mystery shooter who turns out to be Frank Lawson (Frank Ellis).\r The film apparently did not generate enough interest for a series, but was re-released by Astor Pictures in 1949 under the title Bad Man From Big Bend.","popularity":0.6378,"poster_path":"/jjjFXKwKsmpetlCQESKztdONZN8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78243,"logo_path":null,"name":"Three Crown Productions Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1946-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"THUNDERING GUNS IN A GHOSTLY EMPIRE of FRAUD and HATE!","title":"Swing, Cowboy, Swing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Bad Man From Big Bend","type":"re-release title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1492436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cal Shrum","original_name":"Cal Shrum","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/priIySJM9vMcivupUE8HgtXfJHh.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Cal, Rhythm Rangers Band Leader","credit_id":"58f4eeefc3a3686e7300007a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Terhune","original_name":"Max Terhune","popularity":0.1336,"profile_path":"/gHnWl1KSoJIMrHa3ezW8M2IEkdN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"'Alibi' Terhune","credit_id":"58f4eefdc3a3686e34000087","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1644372,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alta Lee","original_name":"Alta Lee","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Alta, Cal Shrum Band Singer","credit_id":"58f4ef0a9251411041000090","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1492438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walt Shrum","original_name":"Walt Shrum","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Walt, Colorado Hillbillies Band Leader","credit_id":"58f4ef18c3a3686dfb00008e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1798080,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Weston","original_name":"Don Weston","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Guitar Player","credit_id":"58f4ef2692514110060000af","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"I.
