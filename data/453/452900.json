To warn others, the Taoist priests told this story: Fifteen hundred years later, student Xiao Liu mistakenly entered a women’s bathroom and saw Wenxia bathing, leading to his public humiliation. When his sister Liu Cui reported it, Wenxia framed her, prompting Liu Cui to swear revenge. Wenxia, who had many boyfriends, stirred rivalry between Lu Xing and Chunfeng. During a trip, Wenxia and Chunfeng were attacked by someone bribed by Liu Cui, and both were injured. Daxiong saved Wenxia but had bad intentions, leading to a fight in which Lu Xing, Chunfeng, and Daxiong died, and Wenxia was trapped. Liu Cui was arrested for murder.
