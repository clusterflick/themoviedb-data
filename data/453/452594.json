If they want to move away to pursue new experiences — perhaps in nearby Montreal — they risk losing credibility, or worse yet, their rights as Mohawk women. Of course, if they stay, their opportunities in the tiny community are limited. With insight, humour and heart, director Tracey Deer (who left Kahnawake to attend school and pursue filmmaking) returns to her community to follow these Mohawk girls and tell their stories. Her deeply emotional documentary reveals the complex hope, heartache and promise of growing up Indigenous in the 21st century.","popularity":0.0846,"poster_path":"/wvQTRja41NBAGDmlmLQId7mw7EJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mohawk Girls","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1717227,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tracey Deer","original_name":"Tracey Deer","popularity":0.0778,"profile_path":"/kmeEWLpMCH6npViKHeAOcxQAJUO.jpg","credit_id":"58f4be529251413d840238c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1717227,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tracey Deer","original_name":"Tracey Deer","popularity":0.0778,"profile_path":"/kmeEWLpMCH6npViKHeAOcxQAJUO.jpg","credit_id":"58f4be6ac3a36807fd020c12","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1261307,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christina Fon","original_name":"Christina Fon","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f4be85c3a3680835022f5c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1261308,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Linda Ludwick","original_name":"Linda Ludwick","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f4bea2c3a36807df0215b6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":940500,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adam Symansky","original_name":"Adam Symansky","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f4beb9c3a3680867024c55","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1797830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joanne Robertson","original_name":"Joanne Robertson","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f4bed9c3a36807fd020c85","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2693152","wikidata_id":"Q6893771","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":2176,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wvQTRja41NBAGDmlmLQId7mw7EJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1544}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Source: IMDB (Sudbury)","release_date":"2005-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
