Historian Dr. Lucy Worsley, Chief Curator at Historic Royal Palaces, reveals that it has always been this way. Exploring the royal wardrobes of our kings and queens over the last four hundred years, Lucy shows this isn't just a public fascination, but an important and powerful message from the monarchs. From Elizabeth I to the present Queen Elizabeth II, Lucy explains how the royal wardrobe's significance goes far beyond the cut and color of the clothing. Royal fashion is, and has always been, regarded as a very personal statement to reflect their power over the reign. Most kings and queens have carefully choreographed every aspect of their wardrobe; for those who have not, there have sometimes been calamitous consequences. As much today as in the past, royal fashion is as much about politics as it is about elegant attire.","popularity":0.6547,"poster_path":"/hgd9QchyTNLGvnQeQhPgc9czaxK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":686,"logo_path":"/qMVjV8YFbxXrGVF4wD6hRjllVbr.png","name":"Tiger Aspect","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tales from the Royal Wardrobe","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1565978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucy Worsley","original_name":"Lucy Worsley","popularity":0.1979,"profile_path":"/7fqSXmu4On4KInsQxzCxz5vzgJl.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Herself - Presenter","credit_id":"58f1114dc3a3681a52002165","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1869534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beatrice Behlen","original_name":"Beatrice Behlen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Curator, Museum of London","credit_id":"5e0e55d7c2f44b0013303696","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2497291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shaun Cole","original_name":"Shaun Cole","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Royal College of Fashion","credit_id":"5e0e55e368b1ea0013801433","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1507018,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Meredith Etherington-Smith","original_name":"Meredith Etherington-Smith","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":"/2tF8xxQMAni14VhHYfXHWbNdlG3.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Editor in Chief, Christie's Publishing","credit_id":"5e0e55ecc2f44b0011307e72","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1380764,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Gillam-Smith","original_name":"Nick Gillam-Smith","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f111979251415542002152","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1755170,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mike Craven-Todd","original_name":"Mike Craven-Todd","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c58263fc3a3684246867387","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1380764,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Gillam-Smith","original_name":"Nick Gillam-Smith","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c58262c9251415e3469b2d5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1760364,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Fred Hart","original_name":"Fred Hart","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5826500e0a263ccde55153","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3895742","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/49B7t8aTQObo3gQVHG94ZtCizfZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hgd9QchyTNLGvnQeQhPgc9czaxK.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1047,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wN7wBly7rxDSAjn8ymrN8Nd82ql.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":698},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gCFVsDVYwar9D1CswEOWgdTVRhO.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1715,"name":"symbolism"},{"id":2471,"name":"monarchy"},{"id":6098,"name":"clothing"},{"id":9920,"name":"royalty"},{"id":15479,"name":"fashion"},{"id":159862,"name":"british history"},{"id":177040,"name":"fashion design"},{"id":220649,"name":"british monarchy"},{"id":233248,"name":"wardrobe"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TALES FROM THE ROYAL WARDROBE | Preview | PBS","key":"C8hahEK8smU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2015-06-10T20:03:37.000Z","id":"5e0e5569fd4f8000155fbb0f"}]}}}
