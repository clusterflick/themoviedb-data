Surprisingly, a young conductor named Tonoin Kei (known as a musical genius) joins this small orchestra to conduct. Even though Tonoin is a strict conductor, all the members adore him for the notable improvements in their performances and soon Yuuki feels his efforts for the orchestra have been fruitless. Yuuki soon comes to the conclusion that his crush of 3 years likes Tonoin, and he decides to give up on her and leave the orchestra. Tonoin refuses to let him quit, confessing that he loves Yuuki, which reveals that he's gay. Tonoin's love confession confuses Yuuki and it leads to a very horrible misunderstanding.","popularity":0.9871,"poster_path":"/dGgdoe8IlsPr1ZRx1IIlXtVfNzF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152349,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bee Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1997-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fujimi Block No. 2 Symphony Orchestra","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Fujimi 2-choume Kokyogakudan","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"富士見二丁目交響楽団","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Fujimi Orchestra","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryotaro Okiayu","original_name":"置鮎龍太郎","popularity":1.225,"profile_path":"/qbj3cFQqWwZ6x7S1jEpOJa57sEZ.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Yuuki Morimura","credit_id":"58f20edc9251412fb5008f2b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1241640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yasunori Masutani","original_name":"増谷康紀","popularity":0.4383,"profile_path":"/2lD6Asv3YHHifKX0N69Zf3cI7Ki.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Kei Tonoin","credit_id":"58f20eee9251412fa9008b5e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":115792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masako Katsuki","original_name":"勝生真沙子","popularity":1.8006,"profile_path":"/szBdXm77jVvvHLaDoxEs9Nl9dtF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Natsuko Kawashima","credit_id":"58f20f039251412fb5008f4b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akira Ishida","original_name":"石田彰","popularity":1.6611,"profile_path":"/jnW2Gn2NlR2uwOCeyOuzypnTmkH.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Taketo Igarashi","credit_id":"58f20f15c3a3682e66008bf2","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1128355,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Akira Nishimori","original_name":"西森章","popularity":0.2297,"profile_path":"/vPRboAZrIKoErMPquZ6Mdt9RRQv.jpg","credit_id":"639a9fd00f0da500cb708fd9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16368116","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dGgdoe8IlsPr1ZRx1IIlXtVfNzF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1127}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10180,"name":"male homosexuality"},{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1997-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
