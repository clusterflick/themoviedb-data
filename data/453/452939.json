Their search remains fruitless until Mokhir reports the discovery of a uranium deposit, but disappears before Jean can identify the location. He goes to the Countess for help in finding Mokhir and surprises her when, due to financial difficulties, she is negotiating her concession with the Englishman Hobson, director of a rival company. Attracted by Jean, the Countess nevertheless gives him her preference and they set off together in search of Mokhir.","popularity":0.5434,"poster_path":"/vOvVKpQb7xoWpqlxKeI5ZharEzS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62911,"logo_path":null,"name":"C.T.I.","origin_country":""},{"id":2342,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cino del Duca","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":54544,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jeannic Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1956-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lebanese Mission","video":false,"vote_average":2.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Die Herrscherin vom Libanon","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Claude Pascal","original_name":"Jean-Claude Pascal","popularity":0.2731,"profile_path":"/8qEqBf7dfG0ztHyDVKvSztPqcYR.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Jean Domèvre","credit_id":"58fa6816c3a3687a2a000c9e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":57472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gianna Maria Canale","original_name":"Gianna Maria Canale","popularity":0.2354,"profile_path":"/vOuFVeDIyIhGscqcvWa4BPGmOVy.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Comtesse Athelstane Orloff","credit_id":"58fa68169251416428000d02","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Servais","original_name":"Jean Servais","popularity":0.1769,"profile_path":"/qnfXAaTixWzYKX8LYTb1YPPLsbL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Maj.
