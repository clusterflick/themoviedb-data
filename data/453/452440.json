Learn of his love for Josephine Beauharnais, and his rise to Emperor. Witness his extraordinary achievements and ultimately his fall, his final battles, his exile to Elba, and his defeat at Waterloo.  For nearly two decades he strode the world stage like a colossus -- loved and despised, venerated and feared. From his birth on the rugged island of Corsica to his final exile on the godforsaken island of St. Helena, NAPOLEON brings this extraordinary figure to life.","popularity":0.7861,"poster_path":"/nsfF5bSfg9X0b2XOoHNqa76AS9z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86234,"logo_path":null,"name":"Devillier Donegan Enterprises","origin_country":""},{"id":27649,"logo_path":"/xqVQVDFxOuvgEhonUoYqJuNVRNA.png","name":"David Grubin Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":88983,"logo_path":null,"name":"PBS Docstar","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":216,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Napoleon","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Empires: Napoleon","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David McCullough","original_name":"David McCullough","popularity":0.3212,"profile_path":"/wgWz9xD6ZXl547LR4VrSQifsKUr.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"58f39215c3a368085a0120e4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113425,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Grubin","original_name":"David Grubin","popularity":0.1777,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f3922b9251413d720132cf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113425,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Grubin","original_name":"David Grubin","popularity":0.1777,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f392389251413d8001281b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113425,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Grubin","original_name":"David Grubin","popularity":0.1777,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f3924e9251413da7012f05","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1064614,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Allyson Luchak","original_name":"Allyson Luchak","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f392649251413d6e013f06","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0266164","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nsfF5bSfg9X0b2XOoHNqa76AS9z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":254,"name":"france"},{"id":4381,"name":"napoleon bonaparte"},{"id":221549,"name":"waterloo"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2000-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
