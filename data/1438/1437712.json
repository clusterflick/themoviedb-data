Perpetuating 16th century Spanish traditions of guitar-making, Cruz fashions such musical instruments as cuatros, marimba, escarpandola, and his own creation, a mandolin with two fretboards. He is an accomplished musician as well. In this moving portrait, Cruz compares himself to a decaying colonial church across the street: revered yet neglected, the village altar stands, paint peeling, under the open sky.","popularity":0.3365,"poster_path":"/zEcyLWOyKJtPuvnBE3niIBuPfe9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El rey del bandolín","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5261070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cruz Quinal","original_name":"Cruz Quinal","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/zEcyLWOyKJtPuvnBE3niIBuPfe9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67b86d32550329275622739e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1306654,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Dickinson","original_name":"John Dickinson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/6FuTdhU9p5pBBoQhDKMY6VbAhZA.jpg","credit_id":"67b86d43bc84d56cbeba6f41","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1306654,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Dickinson","original_name":"John Dickinson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/6FuTdhU9p5pBBoQhDKMY6VbAhZA.jpg","credit_id":"67b86d4b444dd7fcefba709c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1954948","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zEcyLWOyKJtPuvnBE3niIBuPfe9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":214745,"name":"venezuelan history"},{"id":240580,"name":"venezuelan music"},{"id":318364,"name":"latin american music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Mandolin King - PREVIEW","key":"V4kXlo_r7zw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2008-08-28T23:19:13.000Z","id":"67b86db5bc84d56cbeba6f61"}]}}}
