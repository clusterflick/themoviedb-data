With help from misguided pals, he awkwardly explores queerness—only to stumble into workplace success by embracing his accidental \"straightness\". But when a fujoshi boss crashes his identity crisis, sparking real attraction, his life spirals into chaos: Should he stay poker-straight? Lean into queerness? Pursue forbidden office romance? As slapstick soul-searching collides with corporate absurdity, Chen discovers that labels crumble where empathy, courage, and messy human connections begin.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Straight Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
