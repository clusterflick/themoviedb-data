Much like the early screenings of Nan Goldin’s BALLAD OF SEXUAL DEPENDENCY, Morrisroe’s films were often shown in underground punk bars, independent cinemas, and intimate, occasionally deserted classrooms at Tufts University, frequently with the “actors” as the sole audience. These films, like his photographic works, are valuable not only as standalone pieces but also as part of the historical archive of what was theorized as the Boston Group. Ultimately, Morrisroe’s films remain a poignant testament to a delirious, intimate world; the beautiful memory of a home and a chosen family.","popularity":0.2066,"poster_path":"/6oARbw5xuvFaTQWnTGIiNdUDQZ5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hello From Bertha","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2071381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Morrisroe","original_name":"Mark Morrisroe","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b6933629d9aa3dc8ca4e43","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6oARbw5xuvFaTQWnTGIiNdUDQZ5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
