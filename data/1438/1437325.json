Honoring ancient rites and competitions, Rapa Nui families participate in nine days of athletic feats, cultural demonstrations and ceremonies paying respect to the land, water and other natural beings of the island. They also crown a Queen to represent her people for a year throughout Polynesia and on the world stage.  The film traces the journey of 19-year-old candidate Vaitiare and her family as they join work to earn her the crown and represent this small but well-known island as its people fight for increased autonomy and recognition on the world stage. Through intimate character portraits, behind-the-curtain moments and heartfelt musical performances, “Te Pito o Te Henua” reveals the true meaning of Tāpati and the deep connections the Rapa Nui share with their lands and waters.","popularity":0.5707,"poster_path":"/oPWkRHgzpreTTvqw0Tnh7qOT8vQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2024-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Navel of the World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","title":"Te Pito o Te Henua","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5259428,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martín Kingman","original_name":"Martín Kingman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b756cc444dd7fcefba0b2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1180811,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nils Cowan","original_name":"Nils Cowan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b7570bbc84d56cbeba0a15","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5259442,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Irene “Veri” Teave Tuki","original_name":"Irene “Veri” Teave Tuki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b7574555032927562219ef","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5259444,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gina Pakarati","original_name":"Gina Pakarati","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b7575cbc84d56cbeba0a67","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1180811,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nils Cowan","original_name":"Nils Cowan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b7576e7434200c28221a44","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1052640,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bryan Gunnar Cole","original_name":"Bryan Gunnar Cole","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b757987434200c28221a81","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2638043,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tracy Rector","original_name":"Tracy Rector","popularity":0.0594,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b757b87434200c28221aaa","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5259428,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martín Kingman","original_name":"Martín Kingman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b757d3a2284666f1eaf712","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oPWkRHgzpreTTvqw0Tnh7qOT8vQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1551,"name":"indigenous"},{"id":3693,"name":"climate"},{"id":161318,"name":"enviromental"},{"id":162710,"name":"culture"},{"id":238077,"name":"guardianship"},{"id":287208,"name":"native language"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Te Pito o Te Henua - Trailer","key":"913604419","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-02-16T07:42:16.000Z","id":"67b75562550329275622191c"}]}}}
