Holban’s Who Is to Blame? has something else in common with Mészáros’s Let All the Children Smile: they both include sequences filmed at the same orphanage in Bucharest (Orphanage No. 6)—Mészáros in the mid-50s, Holban a decade later. The two films also share a certain discretion regarding the role of the State, which assumed parental responsibility for children abandoned or separated from their parents. Here, both directors allow, albeit only briefly, the lonely and deprived children to appear as individuals with their own histories and traumas. Unlike Mészáros, however, Holban approaches her topic through a judicial lens: numerous sequences from her film were shot at the Tribunal, and the film credits a prosecutor as a consultant.","popularity":0.0434,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":155806,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studioul \"Alexandru Sahia\"","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"1965-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Who Is to Blame?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2708325,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Florica Holban","original_name":"Florica Holban","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b784eebc84d56cbeba1fe2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2708325,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Florica Holban","original_name":"Florica Holban","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b784f67434200c28222cf4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5259790,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gheorghe Georgescu","original_name":"Gheorghe Georgescu","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b7850a7434200c28222cff","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4525491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vasile Mănăstireanu","original_name":"Vasile Mănăstireanu","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b7853a7434200c28222d21","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4451094,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Vasile Nițu","original_name":"Vasile Nițu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b785597434200c28222d25","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4618247,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Claudiu Soltescu","original_name":"Claudiu Soltescu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b7856b7434200c28222d2e","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5259794,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mihai Romașcu","original_name":"Mihai Romașcu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b7858521d4708b60eb0c8f","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5259795,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Maria Nicolaescu","original_name":"Maria Nicolaescu","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b7859b7434200c28222d55","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2476103,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Radu Zamfirescu","original_name":"Radu Zamfirescu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b785aabc84d56cbeba2043","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3123601,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Silvia Chiric","original_name":"Silvia Chiric","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b785ba5503292756222dff","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4451105,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Vasile Dumitrescu","original_name":"Vasile Dumitrescu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b785cc444dd7fcefba1e07","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4451106,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simion Zaharia","original_name":"Simion Zaharia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b78613a2284666f1eb0726","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5259801,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gică Roșioru","original_name":"Gică Roșioru","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b7862721d4708b60eb0cc9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3713384,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Iordan Roșioru","original_name":"Iordan Roșioru","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b7867321d4708b60eb0cea","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5259804,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Florin Balmez","original_name":"Florin Balmez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b786845503292756222e6a","department":"Production","job":"Consulting Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ro","note":"","release_date":"1965-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
