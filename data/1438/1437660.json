Del Valle's performance is a fusion of Indigenous, Spanish, and African influences, where he transforms into a drumming, dancing black Satan. His portrayal draws inspiration from various sources, including the myth of Saint Michael the Archangel, the behavior of cats—animals often linked to witchcraft—and his own dreams, creating a unique and personal interpretation of the devil. Through this ritualistic dance, the documentary delves into themes of cultural syncretism, identity, and the enduring power of traditional expressions in Venezuela.","popularity":0.1125,"poster_path":"/1FvRv7AnR5CH2xYuqrrpj2SO0yB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":254170,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinematográfica Nueva Andalucía","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cumaná Devil","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Cumaná Devil","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5260947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis del Valle Hurtado","original_name":"Luis del Valle Hurtado","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67b84fa37434200c28227927","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1306654,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Dickinson","original_name":"John Dickinson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/6FuTdhU9p5pBBoQhDKMY6VbAhZA.jpg","credit_id":"67b84ccc21d4708b60eb4cdb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1658234,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Miguel Nazario","original_name":"Miguel Nazario","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b84d2b444dd7fcefba645b","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1468393,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stefano Gramitto","original_name":"Stefano Gramitto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/pnFJilM5S0WP6r5aV7bubxoNrzJ.jpg","credit_id":"67b84d3b21d4708b60eb4d22","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2502545,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Carlos González","original_name":"Carlos González","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b84d76bc84d56cbeba61c4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1306654,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Dickinson","original_name":"John Dickinson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/6FuTdhU9p5pBBoQhDKMY6VbAhZA.jpg","credit_id":"67b84d8f55032927562268e0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1951119","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v0AgQbeRsBNba7qwo96bS7HJ4NA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1FvRv7AnR5CH2xYuqrrpj2SO0yB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":346766,"name":"venezuelan art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Cumana Devil (El Diablo De Cumana) - PREVIEW","key":"kRc6XDiABxc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2008-09-05T19:28:48.000Z","id":"67b84e1021d4708b60eb4d85"}]}}}
