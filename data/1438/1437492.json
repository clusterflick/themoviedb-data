This most numerous group of animals on the planet by far - three quarters of all species - have also been called the “glue of life” on Earth.  They literally hold ecosystems together.  Insects were the first animals to evolve flight more than 400 million years ago, and they survived all five of the known mass extinctions since then.  But, there is evidence that the pace of decline among insects in parts of the world today is fast approaching the levels of previous catastrophes.","popularity":0.0534,"poster_path":"/ng1SftJmESaEebSDo5DYBTrZJ2f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Little Things that Run the World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5260105,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sandy Gross","original_name":"Sandy Gross","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b7b2a5444dd7fcefba2e16","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5260106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Hutton","original_name":"John Hutton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b7b2b75503292756223b6c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1034571,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Doug Hawes-Davis","original_name":"Doug Hawes-Davis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b7b2c8bc84d56cbeba30a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ng1SftJmESaEebSDo5DYBTrZJ2f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
