Some of the NAACP leaders are familiar, including W.E.B. Du Bois and Thurgood Marshall, but Walter White, head of the NAACP from 1929 to 1955, has been all but forgotten. With his blond hair and blue eyes, Walter White looked white; he described himself as “an enigma, a Black man occupying a white body.”  Like virtually all light-skinned African Americans of his day, White was descended from enslaved Black women and powerful white men. But he was Black — by law, identity, and conviction and spent his entire life fighting for Black civil rights.  Forgotten Hero: Walter White and the NAACP traces the life of this neglected civil rights hero and seeks to explain his disappearance from our history.","popularity":1.8182,"poster_path":"/pwRUg4Ums5XXfMo9cJxLlumu2oj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124017,"logo_path":"/ioSRRQqdux1jFOxjBI5jUxcruGW.png","name":"PBS","origin_country":"US"},{"id":92479,"logo_path":"/xBlCFYbQb8H4ZpIMLco53ybin9L.png","name":"American Experience Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":158800,"logo_path":"/pGWvq9K7JpBSdXlpurfA6FsGlOh.png","name":"The WNET Group","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Most Famous Activist You've Never Heard Of","title":"Forgotten Hero: Walter White and the NAACP","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Morton","original_name":"Joe Morton","popularity":1.0389,"profile_path":"/w7rGWWSGKWWukojLbZOQJ5yh9jv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"67bfa9a98c386c4e5bc8c62e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":182617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geoffrey Owens","original_name":"Geoffrey Owens","popularity":0.7159,"profile_path":"/PO73VvUgDsAIYY6sdzDw01HFSk.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Walter White (voice)","credit_id":"67bfa9ce551c054beca23bac","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3038687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Mack","original_name":"Kenneth Mack","popularity":0.0917,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67bfacf3c5de842b4ba23849","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5271869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karlos Hill","original_name":"Karlos Hill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67bfad14c93271491f35935a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3038699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Sullivan","original_name":"Patricia Sullivan","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67bfad36740c95a371a23cf5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3910660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josef M.
