But when the scan reveals unexpected complications, she and her husband, Darragh, are forced to confront a ridiculous reality that will test their trust in the health-care system. As Ife deals with confusing cramps, weirdly casual medical staff, and her mother's cryptic warnings, the couple faces a terrifying yet darkly comedic reality about motherhood, health-care, and family secrets. Equal parts surreal and hilarious, this film flips the script on what it means to be a mother-especially when the stakes are higher than you'd expect.","popularity":0.2011,"poster_path":"/zippCk3aWDFX4T5LW24Fav7YMy0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205539,"logo_path":"/eaSWKgjxtvdtlPubswPJkEDY5Vy.png","name":"Keeper Pictures","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Knife","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5259921,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tishe Fatunbi","original_name":"Tishe Fatunbi","popularity":0.0766,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ife","credit_id":"67b790ed21d4708b60eb121a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3004480,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiernan Messitt-Greene","original_name":"Tiernan Messitt-Greene","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":"/5F6l0NGwMjus74KHKT5TXcRmvK.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Darragh","credit_id":"67b79115444dd7fcefba21c2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2271645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashionye Michelle Raccah","original_name":"Ashionye Michelle Raccah","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/kN3y72RQu3gtn2jAdcgw29Bj8Hn.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Fatima","credit_id":"67b79142a2284666f1eb0a37","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1865576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leah O'Rourke","original_name":"Leah O'Rourke","popularity":0.1127,"profile_path":"/bkvboMDx8a9Y7ueyIeXWviCmGP7.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Nurse Siobhan","credit_id":"67b791677434200c282231b4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1362118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Risteard Cooper","original_name":"Risteard Cooper","popularity":0.0976,"profile_path":"/cM0PgBm4lLKCqpJaiQqS7RAReM5.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Dr. Mahon","credit_id":"67b79185bc84d56cbeba2534","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5259913,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Grace Odumosu","original_name":"Grace Odumosu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b7908cbc84d56cbeba248a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5259915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joy Nesbitt","original_name":"Joy Nesbitt","popularity":0.1099,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b790a77434200c28223147","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5259915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joy Nesbitt","original_name":"Joy Nesbitt","popularity":0.1099,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b790bcbc84d56cbeba24a8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35519465","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tpsliDIFEl02LqZ1iA0MjlxbUAC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1622,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zippCk3aWDFX4T5LW24Fav7YMy0.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1081}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Dublin International Film Festival ","release_date":"2025-02-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
