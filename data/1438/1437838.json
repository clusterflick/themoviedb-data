The operaâ€™s subject is Don Juan, the notorious libertine of fiction, and his eventual descent into hell. For Mozart, it was an unusually intense work, and it was not entirely understood in his own time. Within a generation, however, it was recognized as one of the greatest of all operas. Presented by the Salzburg Marionette Theatre with narration provided by Sir Peter Ustinov.","popularity":0.2004,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":237290,"logo_path":"/ybY4aLZxf7jcFDizkFTntgTjsQr.png","name":"ZDF/3sat","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Salzburg Marionette Theatre: Don Giovanni","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Ustinov","original_name":"Peter Ustinov","popularity":1.3363,"profile_path":"/7GHLBhcNCiRugTcUt76HgtkZCUg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"67b8ae65a2284666f1eb7bcd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1118204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cesare Siepi","original_name":"Cesare Siepi","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Don Giovanni","credit_id":"67b8ae7455032927562297d7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":553367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Birgit Nilsson","original_name":"Birgit Nilsson","popularity":0.0912,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Donna Anna","credit_id":"67b8ae817434200c2822ab9b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1248656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leontyne Price","original_name":"Leontyne Price","popularity":0.09,"profile_path":"/4ItBqAJCC5q7pWNXLbB6tOuX2Uw.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Donna Elvira","credit_id":"67b8ae8f444dd7fcefba8f91","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5261540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cesare Valletti","original_name":"Cesare Valletti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Don Ottavio","credit_id":"67b8aea2444dd7fcefba8fa3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2460308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fernando Corena","original_name":"Fernando Corena","popularity":0.1227,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Leporello","credit_id":"67b8aeab7434200c2822abaf","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5261541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugenia Ratti","original_name":"Eugenia Ratti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Zerlina","credit_id":"67b8aeb77434200c2822abc1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2023989,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arnold Van Mill","original_name":"Arnold Van Mill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Il Commendatore","credit_id":"67b8aec4a2284666f1eb7bf2","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2422457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erich Leinsdorf","original_name":"Erich Leinsdorf","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b8aed77434200c2822abc9","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5253611,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wolf-Dieter Ludwig","original_name":"Wolf-Dieter Ludwig","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b8aee8bc84d56cbeba9246","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18170,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","original_name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","popularity":0.1183,"profile_path":"/p4ueHlbsBraC1AMAGDCYJJ5L9cw.jpg","credit_id":"67b8aef1bc84d56cbeba924c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":233456,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lorenzo da Ponte","original_name":"Lorenzo da Ponte","popularity":0.0785,"profile_path":"/mM38EiXvY2Oi7cLrvXdT6j0S2aa.jpg","credit_id":"67b8af027434200c2822abda","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
