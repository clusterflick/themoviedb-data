In counterpoint to the images, Richard Long explains his approach. Since 1967, Richard Long (1945, Bristol), who belongs to the land art movement, has traveled the world on foot and installed, in places often inaccessible to the public, stones, sticks and driftwood found in situ. His ephemeral works are reproduced through photography. He thus made walking an art, and land art an aspiration of modern man for solitude in nature.","popularity":0.2789,"poster_path":"/owyn1LPEbSXbTXf6LiEY5SEZgrZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93961,"logo_path":null,"name":"Milestone Film & Video","origin_country":"US"},{"id":718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arts Council of England","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":12998,"logo_path":"/naSCIDEqnFuEttggDVgZIMtgxzz.png","name":"Centre Georges Pompidou","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":153395,"logo_path":"/oVCO4P9C1pEyO38OfclcsMHHT7U.png","name":"La Sept","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stones and Flies: Richard Long in the Sahara","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4815246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Long","original_name":"Richard Long","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/cDiy99yqTNKlndZY8ZBBJRuRmf5.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67b66b2f0dd22ec79c3af3d2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philip Haas","original_name":"Philip Haas","popularity":0.0905,"profile_path":"/ejZkqudQcMsNTY126047kQ76xiJ.jpg","credit_id":"67b686a00dd22ec79c3afbda","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philip Haas","original_name":"Philip Haas","popularity":0.0905,"profile_path":"/ejZkqudQcMsNTY126047kQ76xiJ.jpg","credit_id":"67b686a799998623c1147c1a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35848159","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/botiJOT6X3ZdQJX25NCWuIenDw7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4H7DfNp7dHf6HW03cx4tXjr6Z1X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eU9QoyXuMCCVAublFYVRkG3B3zX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pZwdyhQOw6dkNNQoaufKNhaUBB7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/owyn1LPEbSXbTXf6LiEY5SEZgrZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6MNSmYmeKtCSYBtOSBjr2EFuTuS.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/auOSeet3WzA4T8NCsIf623MHrGw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6024,"name":"sculpture"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":166676,"name":"contemporary art"},{"id":169449,"name":"algeria"},{"id":175985,"name":"landscape"},{"id":227302,"name":"portrait of an artist"},{"id":293547,"name":"djazair"},{"id":320760,"name":"algerian sahara"},{"id":339780,"name":"land art"},{"id":347237,"name":"richard long"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
