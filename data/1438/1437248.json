In his youth he and little gypsy maid Jane were friends and sweethearts. When Willieâ€™s father died, he went to the city where he met \"The Painted Woman,\" spending his last cent on her, but they had genuinely fallen in love and he promises to stay with the woman, who is fatally ill, until she dies. Penniless and ill, he wanders out into the street and thence to the meadows, where he is found by Jane and nursed back to health. Fearing his love may not be true, she tells him that if he finds her wherever she may wander, one year from that date, that she will believe him and marry him. A long weary year passes when he arrives in that very village just as the chimes are ringing, and there he finds Jane. His story finished, Buckland points to Jane and their children with a happy smile.","popularity":0.0737,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gypsy Trail","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Gone to the Dogs","type":"alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Moreno","original_name":"Antonio Moreno","popularity":0.2741,"profile_path":"/swsEgnc8bkILLcOjUDPGtZdXnQs.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Willie Buckland - a Gypsy","credit_id":"67b726aded0bbcc50f657c74","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2652468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frankie Mann","original_name":"Frankie Mann","popularity":0.0498,"profile_path":"/7f5rEPwHWkb9SwdcDLonQvGqZ1c.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jane","credit_id":"67b726b50c61025fafc4093e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1450040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Hall","original_name":"Donald Hall","popularity":0.08,"profile_path":"/iZw060Ow8pzhs3DVLZrtVQLWHaV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67b726be0c61025fafc40943","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1365593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josephine Earle","original_name":"Josephine Earle","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":"/2aM7hFnCfqrDlDN8L4UaSZhsmuJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67b726c5e484fc21541a114b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1382696,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nellie Anderson","original_name":"Nellie Anderson","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67b726cc0c61025fafc40953","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3843035,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Handworth","original_name":"Harry Handworth","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b726d9ed0bbcc50f657c99","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5258990,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Kester","original_name":"Paul Kester","popularity":0.1055,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b726eced0bbcc50f657ca7","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0005438","wikidata_id":"Q21184609","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1915-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
