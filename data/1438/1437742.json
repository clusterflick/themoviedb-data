One year later, he composed Cut the Parrot, a new requiem intended for Albert, who also died amid total indifference. As in his previous film, the film-maker gathered a series of eulogies in honour of the deceased from the people, some close and others not so close, who were emotionally affected by his death. But this film differs from the previous one in that it seems to be based not only on respect but also on an intense anger. Several times Donigan films his own face and angrily tells about how he was informed of Albert's death or about his visit to the morgue to identify the body. From then on the principle behind his cinematographic quest seems clearly exposed: no life, however marginal it may seem, should end in such a way, without any consideration.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/nKbxzjB3iHTXJH7ASe6flUOLTu0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1996-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cut the Parrot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5261188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerald Harvey","original_name":"Gerald Harvey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Gerry","credit_id":"67b87ba8a2284666f1eb6110","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1927664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donigan Cumming","original_name":"Donigan Cumming","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/c8Qqi9ZLDga8DARrBx1AIh7RMo3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Donigan","credit_id":"67b87bb8bc84d56cbeba7623","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5261189,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geoffrey Bates","original_name":"Geoffrey Bates","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Geoff","credit_id":"67b87bc955032927562276fc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3789154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beatrice Johnson","original_name":"Beatrice Johnson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Beatrice","credit_id":"67b87be5a2284666f1eb6135","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1934277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Barclay","original_name":"Elizabeth Barclay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Elizabeth","credit_id":"67b87bf7bc84d56cbeba7650","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1648560,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Susan Thomson","original_name":"Susan Thomson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Susan","credit_id":"67b87c09444dd7fcefba7651","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2943670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Carter","original_name":"James Carter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Jimmy","credit_id":"67b87c235503292756227724","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491440,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gordon Alexander","original_name":"Gordon Alexander","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Alex","credit_id":"67b87c41bc84d56cbeba765f","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1927664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donigan Cumming","original_name":"Donigan Cumming","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/c8Qqi9ZLDga8DARrBx1AIh7RMo3.jpg","credit_id":"67b87c4ebc84d56cbeba7665","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1927664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donigan Cumming","original_name":"Donigan Cumming","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/c8Qqi9ZLDga8DARrBx1AIh7RMo3.jpg","credit_id":"67b87c5cbc84d56cbeba766e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":866,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nKbxzjB3iHTXJH7ASe6flUOLTu0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":581}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
