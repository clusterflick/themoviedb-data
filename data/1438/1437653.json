The authors of the film have collected these shots from the year 2001. to 2008. The experiment explores the ultimate limits of fireworks as sources of light, showing this through real-life dynamic light patters which are led through video processors, resulting in chromatically rich animated samples. The material is \"laboratory\" processed and then formed into a film unit, while respecting the dramaturgy of fireworks. The original sound was used, which was, of course, subsequently processed, too. The whole work process is a kind of \"homage to the tape\" because the entire work is completely recorded and realised on digital video tapes, without using any kind of computer program.","popularity":0.1406,"poster_path":"/5ElQvtKd1ljC6CegOhm3J1mPG96.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":254169,"logo_path":null,"name":"projekt GROZD","origin_country":"HR"},{"id":60850,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hrvatski Filmski Savez (HFS)","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sky Spirits","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1496907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Damir Čučić","original_name":"Damir Čučić","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b84807444dd7fcefba61dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1496907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Damir Čučić","original_name":"Damir Čučić","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b848195503292756226723","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1496451,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boris Poljak","original_name":"Boris Poljak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b84830444dd7fcefba61f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1496451,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boris Poljak","original_name":"Boris Poljak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b84840a2284666f1eb4941","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1496907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Damir Čučić","original_name":"Damir Čučić","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c1f05457f49c841653a791","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1496451,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boris Poljak","original_name":"Boris Poljak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c1f05bd01e30b528dbcfe5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt25841046","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2yw4m3mPc1IrKzExxbKYNGw4m7x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2880}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1616,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5ElQvtKd1ljC6CegOhm3J1mPG96.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1077}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2407,"name":"fireworks"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
