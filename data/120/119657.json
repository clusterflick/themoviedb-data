At the early age of 12, he witnessed the death of his father at the hands of local military authorities, during a well-meant attempt to hand-over a package of drugs he had incidentally found at sea while fishing. As a result of this experience, Julian develops a thirst for revenge that leads him to kill all those involved in his father's death. In the process he becomes a major drug lord and a very powerful headman within Dominican society.","popularity":0.4463,"poster_path":"/d9QZi1QppknaybAabCYcRelrCh2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81479,"logo_path":null,"name":"Entrepreneur Films","origin_country":""},{"id":87317,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unicornio Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DO","name":"Dominican Republic"}],"release_date":"2012-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El Rey de Najayo","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72983,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manny Perez","original_name":"Manny Perez","popularity":0.5816,"profile_path":"/auDXIA7COAJkgPFYlZWAvCuezRG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Julian","credit_id":"52fe4c08c3a36847f821e463","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1070684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luz Garcia","original_name":"Luz Garcia","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Laura","credit_id":"52fe4c08c3a36847f821e467","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergio Carlo","original_name":"Sergio Carlo","popularity":0.1188,"profile_path":"/7l8UJEGcwIswnCMdO7FddPi4aEz.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Tito","credit_id":"52fe4c08c3a36847f821e46b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan Maria Almonte","original_name":"Juan Maria Almonte","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Comandante Ubri","credit_id":"52fe4c08c3a36847f821e46f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1070686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rafael Estephan","original_name":"Rafael Estephan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"General Imbert","credit_id":"52fe4c08c3a36847f821e473","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1070687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Socrates Montas","original_name":"Socrates Montas","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/e2odkhJt6l8Yv6z75M9pSejlZoa.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"General Perez Zapata","credit_id":"52fe4c08c3a36847f821e477","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1070688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Omar Ramirez","original_name":"Omar Ramirez","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Don Pablo","credit_id":"52fe4c08c3a36847f821e47b","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1070682,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fernando Baez Mella","original_name":"Fernando Baez Mella","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c08c3a36847f821e453","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1070682,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fernando Baez Mella","original_name":"Fernando Baez Mella","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c08c3a36847f821e459","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1070683,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Franklin Soto","original_name":"Franklin Soto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c08c3a36847f821e45f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2275671","wikidata_id":"Q105682936","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2pd7ckhDIRkmWziC17OjGJDbnvC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.685,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d9QZi1QppknaybAabCYcRelrCh2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":685}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DO","release_dates":[{"certification":"R","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"El Rey de Najayo - Trailer #2 OFICIAL","key":"Rz76vzDN9uw","published_at":"2012-03-22T21:36:46.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6e8c3a3685448008c99"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"El Rey de Najayo - Trailer Oficial","key":"kwBjcInnooE","published_at":"2012-02-03T22:14:36.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6e8c3a3685448008c98"}]}}}
