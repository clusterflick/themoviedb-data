Motivated by Robles’ vision of a cohort supporting one another to reach for excellence, her colleagues responded. They were even more impressed by the transformation they saw in Robles, who had gone into the National Board process as a good teacher and emerged as a true teacher leader. From Amy Coyle in her third year of teaching, to Billie Williams in her 22nd year, the Mitchell 20 formed a unique and remarkably diverse cohort all focused on a single goal—enhancing their classroom performance.  Recognizing what a powerful professional development opportunity this was, the school’s administration, the Isaac District Office and the Arizona K12 Center all rallied to support this exceptional endeavor. From this, the Mitchell 20 emerged!","popularity":0.0572,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Teacher
