He is more interested in his grandfather, who started as an itinerant violin player, but got rich by leading a herd of wild reindeer south to market. He falls for a violinist working with a married couple of traveling performers and renounces his fortune to go with them. He then tries to earn a fortune by driving reindeer to market, but it doesn’t work out and he goes insane. He is finally restored to sanity by the violinist when she returns with the performers.","popularity":0.1394,"poster_path":"/5zChemakpCpy3b1QogjPVOMXUHv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17620,"logo_path":"/e1EieGeoDpBCx8QdIIh4ZnB0bsT.png","name":"Svenska
