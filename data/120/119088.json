On-stage, Freedom Call take listeners back to a time in which metal concerts were more than concerts; they were shows, theatrical events, musical circuses, larger-than-life spectacles. And Live in Hellvetia captures everything that was extravagant and pompous about metal shows back in the '70s and '80s. Recorded at the Z7 in Pratteln, Switzerland on December 29, 2010, Live in Hellvetia (which is available in both DVD and double-CD versions) documents a 21st century show by a band that didn't exist until 1999 but has remained stubbornly dedicated to the metal of a bygone era.","popularity":0.0441,"poster_path":"/r3bStrKK6fDDvpgSqN8AGfNVpD3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2012-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Z7 in Pratteln, Switzerland on 29 December 2010","title":"Freedom Call: Live in Hellvetia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2291296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Bay","original_name":"Chris Bay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/2MTbo7LU3rCsOdXKyLkdX1GTcMp.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Vocals, Guitars","credit_id":"5cb860dcc3a3686af985a729","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2291297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lars Rettkowitz","original_name":"Lars Rettkowitz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/r1nZN4AtJOVRg5NyG6nEbHpXYvI.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Guitars","credit_id":"5cb860eac3a36872c98134ad","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2291298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samy Saemann","original_name":"Samy Saemann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/ugz4D4Ybfq3An2xY393FnGYSzCx.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bass","credit_id":"5cb860f9c3a3683abf833070","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2291299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klaus Sperling","original_name":"Klaus Sperling","popularity":0.048,"profile_path":"/uQ33SESoo7Qi2rAoEA8qLilYdRE.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Drums","credit_id":"5cb861060e0a266ba2f1116b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2291295,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Katrin Weigmann","original_name":"Katrin Weigmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb860b5c3a36872c9813471","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2291294,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Müller","original_name":"Martin Müller","popularity":0.0623,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb860a60e0a266b90f11ab5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7Wnz6uE7y9sskJRiTDhZ76uJELD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1140,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r3bStrKK6fDDvpgSqN8AGfNVpD3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":760}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
