A cover of the track \"My Funny Valentine\" was performed on the MTV Unplugged performance but is not included on this DVD.  Fans were disappointed to find that both shows appear on the DVD as originally broadcast, with tracks cut short to fit into the syndicated slot. However, a fuller audio version of the MTV Unplugged performance appears on the Debut Live Box disc. The DVD was re-released in 2003 to fix synchronisation problems, and to change the audio from mono to stereo on the MTV Unplugged part.","popularity":0.302,"poster_path":"/pFmM5fNXb1d5ANTFpjkUaFnFOOj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12811,"logo_path":null,"name":"One Little Independent","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Björk:  MTV Unplugged & Live","video":true,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":47,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Björk","original_name":"Björk","popularity":0.571,"profile_path":"/Ahc3TWomYakLcbqZRVBDdf3rhMR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self  - vocals","credit_id":"52fe4c0bc3a36847f821ed55","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1173228,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justin Murphy","original_name":"Justin Murphy","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"551cf3359251416a23001f53","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Russell Thomas","original_name":"Russell Thomas","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"551cf373c3a36837e80017b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4K8iXX6BPlnPU31tvYlF6HQkrx.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kgXj0YbN2zJS1mpxiP6xbFFDQog.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":846,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pFmM5fNXb1d5ANTFpjkUaFnFOOj.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fs0bojAIqBIQS93G0Tz0aZqrWFd.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":667},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qF3BgDJvac8hypgJce1XlWNcnad.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":156205,"name":"concert film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bjork (MTV Unplugged) 'Violently Happy'","key":"PJ7yrISdzfM","published_at":"2009-06-18T13:26:01.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"54e672e49251416f540002ff"}]}}}
