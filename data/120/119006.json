When Jim sees Ann at a club, he falls for her even though she is with Lord Priory. He meets her the next day at the riding path, but she quickly loses him. He searches all over for her, not knowing that his father's hopeful fianc√©e is her Aunt. As his caricature work suffers as he searches, he is fired from his paper. But he makes a comeback with the comics 'Rags to Riches' which is based upon the Pett's. But this upsets the Pett's so much that they go back to New York, and he follows, being careful not to let them know that he is the one who draws the strip that parodies them.","popularity":1.3097,"poster_path":"/mIXONXzaMFl2cjp7X1tn9KHbAuw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1936-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"THE EXCITING ROMANCE OF A KISSABLE GIRL AND A FRESH GUY WITH THAT IMPULSE!!","title":"Piccadilly Jim","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Montgomery","original_name":"Robert Montgomery","popularity":0.3501,"profile_path":"/o2H1yxVxbxlTWP1PZDFXv6oxiFj.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"James Crocker, Jr.","credit_id":"52fe4bf0c3a36847f8219ffd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Morgan","original_name":"Frank Morgan","popularity":0.4522,"profile_path":"/gwbmaZ6EGYbsBbe8pWW3Gded02k.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"James Crocker, Sr. / Count Olav Osric","credit_id":"52fe4bf0c3a36847f821a001","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":104728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madge Evans","original_name":"Madge Evans","popularity":0.2079,"profile_path":"/pl8Za5y7tmMoCgTRkpCcSFISvxd.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Ann Chester","credit_id":"52fe4bf0c3a36847f821a005","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Blore","original_name":"Eric Blore","popularity":0.3749,"profile_path":"/qMZttNGOlnUPmiiff1hgvBa3WPk.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Bayliss, Jim's Butler","credit_id":"52fe4bf0c3a36847f821a009","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billie Burke","original_name":"Billie Burke","popularity":0.3591,"profile_path":"/gciSUzrGMI1BHDxiElw8KEcIOVW.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Eugenia Willis, Nesta's Sister","credit_id":"52fe4bf0c3a36847f821a00d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Benchley","original_name":"Robert Benchley","popularity":0.1837,"profile_path":"/qXJtEUZW459w8hKEcvo4FauhOBy.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Bill Macon","credit_id":"52fe4bf0c3a36847f821a011","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Forbes","original_name":"Ralph Forbes","popularity":0.2961,"profile_path":"/kSZ7qzRsQKLlLrNzvwwfsEWZc8B.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Lord Frederick 'Freddie' Priory","credit_id":"52fe4bf0c3a36847f821a015","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cora Witherspoon","original_name":"Cora Witherspoon","popularity":0.1306,"profile_path":"/dptHFjTA3CDg7d4cpjXqvkthm3S.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Nesta Pett, Ann's Aunt","credit_id":"52fe4bf0c3a36847f821a019","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tommy Bupp","original_name":"Tommy Bupp","popularity":0.1262,"profile_path":"/gGADF9WMJdShw01XfBbxsDobHaP.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Ogden Pett","credit_id":"52fe4bf0c3a36847f821a01d","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1041608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aileen Pringle","original_name":"Aileen Pringle","popularity":0.1489,"profile_path":"/hTEtDoW8jRsM7ZXvD0fw2XhJTzp.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Paducah Pomeroy","credit_id":"52fe4bf0c3a36847f821a021","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grant Mitchell","original_name":"Grant Mitchell","popularity":0.1227,"profile_path":"/1jSSSQNl8sSYGWOPx0yJIBKpUrQ.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Herbert Pett","credit_id":"52fe4bf0c3a36847f821a025","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"E.
