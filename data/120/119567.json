Seventeen-year-old Fania, her baby daughter, her elderly uncle, and her emotionally impaired brother arrive at the port of Jaffa, having survived a pogrom in which all other members of their family were killed. Having no real choice, Fania marries Yechiel, a widower whose wife died of malaria, leaving him to care for their two children himself. The two set out to a small settlement near Safed, where Yechiel and a few other daring settlers are trying to cultivate the barren lands which they bought from local Arabs. Fania is burdened by a harrowing secret she is unable to share with anyone else. but unless her husband Yechiel shares her secret, their marriage cannot be consummated.","popularity":0.1595,"poster_path":"/5ehi7sQqwY5aovbSVSd29eV0ktP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2012-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Valley Of Strength","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1414724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamar Alkan","original_name":"Tamar Alkan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Fania","credit_id":"64279e19960cde009a97209f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1821953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zion Ashkenazi","original_name":"Zion Ashkenazi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Yechiel","credit_id":"64279e25a3e4ba011149cd16","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":545785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lupo Berkowitch","original_name":"Lupo Berkowitch","popularity":0.111,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mr. Becker","credit_id":"64279e31a3e4ba007792fce2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3092169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ya'ackov Bodo","original_name":"Ya'ackov Bodo","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Shura","credit_id":"64279e3a35811d00f2598ea5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ezra Dagan","original_name":"Ezra Dagan","popularity":0.2315,"profile_path":"/4wEfV3uegO3o8tpKPQ4BWVZLe16.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Isser","credit_id":"64279e47c0442901e816db13","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3988890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meitar Cohen","original_name":"Meitar Cohen","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Bella","credit_id":"64279e55a3e4ba011149cd43","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":94701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Levana Finkelstein","original_name":"Levana Finkelstein","popularity":0.0933,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Riva","credit_id":"64279e5d8a88b200f46f4780","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1703608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shimon Mimran","original_name":"Shimon Mimran","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":"/4y1mH2i7JhXgxOD8XKstUgMqE2t.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"64279e6835811d00f2598eb5","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1134920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rotem Zissman-Cohen","original_name":"רותם זיסמן-כהן","popularity":0.1131,"profile_path":"/nDXEZ8iXFZiKcQtYiITLVQoxSYO.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Rivka","credit_id":"64279e72c04429026b12f8ba","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139107,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Wolman","original_name":"דן וולמן","popularity":0.1484,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c05c3a36847f821db51","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2904854,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ran Aviad","original_name":"Ran Aviad","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64551301d48cee0136da29c4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1699221","wikidata_id":"Q6782471","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1502,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5ehi7sQqwY5aovbSVSd29eV0ktP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
