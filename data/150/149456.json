On Sunday 27th of September 1998 the Galway Footbal Team put stop to a famine that had lasted over three decades. In a thrilling encounter in Croke Park, Galway beat Kildare and were crowned 1998 All-Ireland Champions. For the first time in 32 years the Sam Maguire Cup was coming over the Shannon and back to Connaught.  A Year 'Til Sunday reveals what is involved for a panel of thirty young men, chosen by their county, who set off in quest of All-Ireland glory. This film goes beyond the sidelines and into the dressing room for the pre-match, half-time and full-time action. Over a period of 12 months, the players are followed through the agony of the training fields to the ecstasy of victory.  This unique, behind-the-scenes material reveals an insight to sport and life as never before seen.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/ypr9tiBY9HSxf8xi6IETjoyCN43.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1923,"logo_path":"/ilgktofJY7OsURHfccJrug4GKdQ.png","name":"RTÉ","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Walk the walk!","title":"A Year 'til Sunday","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4807277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John O'Mahony","original_name":"John O'Mahony","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66847be91a7c21a710aeb24b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4807273,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Silke","original_name":"Ray Silke","popularity":0.082,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66847b09c469dbc667aeb243","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4807282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gary Fahey","original_name":"Gary Fahey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66847ca90b5ed62abd60a891","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4807283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jarlath Fallon","original_name":"Jarlath Fallon","popularity":0.0757,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66847ce970eace5dc91e6df9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3581046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Donnellan","original_name":"Michael Donnellan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62a0af5135d1bc17f7a87617","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4807286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin McNamara","original_name":"Martin McNamara","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66847d2fa9ae7276fa816469","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3581042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seán Óg de Paor","original_name":"Seán Óg de Paor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62a0af1365e0a216117bfbf3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4807293,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Walsh","original_name":"Kevin Walsh","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66847daa91f58d44891e68e7","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3581044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Divilly","original_name":"John Divilly","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62a0af27dc1cb40fb4ea5789","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3581040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Clancy","original_name":"Paul Clancy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62a0aeeb1e922521e683f2b6","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4807300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Cloherty","original_name":"Michael Cloherty","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66847e8b98c6b8085160a84d","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4807303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Padraig Boyce","original_name":"Padraig Boyce","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66847eb36778da773ac675c8","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4807305,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomás Meehan","original_name":"Tomás Meehan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66847f32b4f8a935f460a878","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4807307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shay Walsh","original_name":"Shay Walsh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66847faeb8ef0f299a775238","order":13}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":110339,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Power","original_name":"David Power","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a0ae8e7b7b4d009f8d1140","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3581036,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Patrick Comer","original_name":"Patrick Comer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a0ae52dc1cb40fb5130d83","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3581034,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"James E.
