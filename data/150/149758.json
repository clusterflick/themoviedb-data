But the truth is, our economy is broken, producing more pollution, greenhouse gasses and garbage than any other country. In these and so many other ways, it just isn’t working. But rather than invest in something better, we continue to keep this ‘dinosaur economy’ on life support with hundreds of billions of dollars of our tax money. The Story of Broke calls for a shift in government spending toward investments in clean, green solutions—renewable energy, safer chemicals and materials, zero waste and more—that can deliver jobs AND a healthier environment. It’s time to rebuild the American Dream; but this time, let’s build it better.","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":"/6iaL0MbcTOagMTkferU0iRtkV0h.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12337,"logo_path":null,"name":"Free Range Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Story of Broke","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1307010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Leonard","original_name":"Annie Leonard","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":"/dCG61s1GahmBbwUEFDeH7bIZNAP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6771d5ab6234c1b46f61342e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127219,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Fox","original_name":"Louis Fox","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6771d637fbe3722a98614c58","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127219,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Fox","original_name":"Louis Fox","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6771d642f9454eeb1d930a54","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1307010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Leonard","original_name":"Annie Leonard","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":"/dCG61s1GahmBbwUEFDeH7bIZNAP.jpg","credit_id":"6771d656f9454eeb1d930a57","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2136515,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jonah Sachs","original_name":"Jonah Sachs","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6771d666fbe3722a98614c7d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cNj6CQYdmWNU3ZTPYd2LpNRQ3Qk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6iaL0MbcTOagMTkferU0iRtkV0h.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
