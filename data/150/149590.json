Not only has she dated everyone there; unbeknownst to her, Ben has invited her lame ex-boyfriend in hopes of reuniting them. As she spends the night avoiding her ex, and the other undesirable guys in attendance, she interacts with a colorful assortment of party peeps. Between disappearing fortune tellers and over crowded jacuzzis, she questions if real love is even possible. The irony; the only person she's the least bit attracted to, is the homeless man!","popularity":0.2132,"poster_path":"/z7oIsxIWwY03MsmeGD2qF0LZprq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Halloween Party","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1128856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elle Newlands","original_name":"Elle Newlands","popularity":0.0807,"profile_path":"/apWcGdMvNdKcnbdmS9Pf0rpnee2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Erin / Studfinder","credit_id":"52fe4bec9251416c7511227b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1128857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Gangarossa","original_name":"Frank Gangarossa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Mason / Homeless Guy","credit_id":"52fe4bec9251416c7511227f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1128858,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chris Pentzell","original_name":"Chris Pentzell","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ben / Dr. Ben Dover","credit_id":"52fe4bec9251416c75112283","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1128859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Blackburn","original_name":"Christine Blackburn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Julie / Dryad","credit_id":"52fe4bec9251416c75112287","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":81408,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Linda Palmer","original_name":"Linda Palmer","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4bec9251416c75112277","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1991059","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z7oIsxIWwY03MsmeGD2qF0LZprq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Awmf5j5RC6tVUZPaljfOYmwrKA0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":671}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
