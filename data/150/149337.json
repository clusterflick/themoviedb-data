The title is derived from a comment by a witness at Adolf Eichmann's trial. According to his testimony, he was whipped 80 times by the Nazis, but was not believed by Israelis after the war; this final doubt of his own people was the \"81st blow\". The 81st Blow is the first film in the Israeli Holocaust Trilogy by Bergman, Ehrlich and Gouri. It was followed by The Last Sea (1980) and Flames in the Ashes (1985).","popularity":0.0512,"poster_path":"/WJKIrWtiXOK6r8ZDpYEEmsE1KO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"1974-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Yiddish","iso_639_1":"yi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The 81st Blow","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Eighty-First Blow","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Ha-Makah Hashmonim V'Echad","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1440148,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Ehrlich","original_name":"Jacques Ehrlich","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd58febd55c3d0014325d79","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":254374,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Bergman","original_name":"David Bergman","popularity":0.1093,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd58fd93faba00013f50e82","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1440149,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Haim Gouri","original_name":"Haim Gouri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd59002d55c3d0017324b31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0071088","wikidata_id":"Q7711996","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.655,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/WJKIrWtiXOK6r8ZDpYEEmsE1KO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":655}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
