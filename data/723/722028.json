In this production, she recounts her extraordinary childhood. Geneviève was raised by a mother who was a drug user and a prostitute. Domestic violence, several moves and school changes could not, in the end, break the woman she was to become. A fascinating and touching story with a good ending.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/xLqKfA4rtWvv8kHSK84fxm4sG9u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94905,"logo_path":"/lRtL6vUevprG57yzMHmrXdPp5NJ.png","name":"iProd Média","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2016-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Geneviève Everell, Miss Sushi : merci la vie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2027329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geneviève Everell","original_name":"Geneviève Everell","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/i8YIohD4BcqotxlpxzQ57ik9icd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5f02862fdd258900379d3390","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1970737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabelle Maréchal","original_name":"Isabelle Maréchal","popularity":0.0899,"profile_path":"/fdt6rnnyJFkfjC5D9ecwRrKYuyT.jpg","credit_id":"5f0286e38ec4ab00323f5fce","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2703309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie-Danielle Hynes","original_name":"Marie-Danielle Hynes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0286dbf0317400395993df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/xLqKfA4rtWvv8kHSK84fxm4sG9u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Canal Vie","release_date":"2016-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
