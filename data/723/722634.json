Beymer was one of the few filmmakers to spend significant time working with Freedom Summer volunteers from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). As a result, other documentary filmmakers frequently seek his footage. Most recently, filmmaker Stanley Nelson relied heavily on A Regular Bouquet when completing his film, Freedom Summer, which premiered in June 2014 on PBS. Beymer’s footage was also included in Henry Hampton’s seminal documentary series, Eyes on the Prize (1987). Featured in episode five, Mississippi: Is This America? (1962-1964), Hampton combined stock footage and first-hand accounts to retell the events of Freedom Summer.","popularity":1.7462,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1964-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Regular Bouquet: Mississippi Summer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Ryan","original_name":"Robert Ryan","popularity":0.6854,"profile_path":"/hpWgaPTbBLGCdYXHcEVLIWaA3m0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"6205678729733800424ec6ee","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Beymer","original_name":"Richard Beymer","popularity":0.7718,"profile_path":"/fgUlTNgBJDZ0FU2dGQGlxOphbJx.jpg","credit_id":"5f053a4061bac400339d2770","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4773208","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1964-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
