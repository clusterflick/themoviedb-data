The poet-musician Orpheus’s eventful journey in the world of shadows, searching for the one he loves and cannot let go, takes him to the Elysian Fields. This is an unexpected place of peaceful, composed of countryside and those in its thrall. It is here that Eurydice is now installed. During his journey Orpheus is thus introduced to a surprising reality: an enclave, a protected place, both near and yet inaccessible, disturbing, between life and death.","popularity":0.0637,"poster_path":"/TsUfEBzTQzOAc6eyj36pQ7PEkd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82718,"logo_path":null,"name":"De Munt / La Monnaie","origin_country":""},{"id":136912,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wiener Festwochen","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orpheus and Eurydice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2153516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stéphanie d’Oustrac","original_name":"Stéphanie d’Oustrac","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Orphée","credit_id":"5f064b8f71458f0037cc7567","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1984412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabine Devieilhe","original_name":"Sabine Devieilhe","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":"/aoBEyy94TmLPXnKApgukLNqfmtk.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Eurydice","credit_id":"5f064bcf71458f0035cc3da2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2706804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fanny Dupont","original_name":"Fanny Dupont","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Amour","credit_id":"5f06e9131d1bf40036632d8c","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1354691,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christoph Willibald Gluck","original_name":"Christoph Willibald Gluck","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f06e71193db92003746c7eb","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1525728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Romeo Castellucci","original_name":"Romeo Castellucci","popularity":0.0519,"profile_path":"/1EDH1YiA5FS1JkPuD63s7qUOom5.jpg","credit_id":"5f06e80113a3200035716b6d","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1365812,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hector Berlioz","original_name":"Hector Berlioz","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/uXu4EJxHhOkz8NqtnBAAwx8CLLG.jpg","credit_id":"5f06e72613a3200035716a5e","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2156287,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Myriam Hoyer","original_name":"Myriam Hoyer","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f06e76455bc3500351da8c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1525728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Romeo Castellucci","original_name":"Romeo Castellucci","popularity":0.0519,"profile_path":"/1EDH1YiA5FS1JkPuD63s7qUOom5.jpg","credit_id":"5f06e83f1d1bf40037643308","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1719126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hervé Niquet","original_name":"Hervé Niquet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f06e7cc5e12000036e41403","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1525728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Romeo Castellucci","original_name":"Romeo Castellucci","popularity":0.0519,"profile_path":"/1EDH1YiA5FS1JkPuD63s7qUOom5.jpg","credit_id":"66f99c5d0f6fa2cfce5f7ce9","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4u7uqkH3154B52IyvgpX4Mo2DMQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/TsUfEBzTQzOAc6eyj36pQ7PEkd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/znaprAQP2xQGR1sqdgCpDxDjF55.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/en5ueHsNbDw2iaDqXVWRcEiZGiQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"French\", \"english_name\"=>\"French\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"fr\", \"native_name\"=>\"French\"}","note":"","release_date":"2014-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
