The production itself is a very classic period production, with utterly authentic costumes and aptly dramatic sets. There are even horses on stage. The depiction of the Don Cossacks’ Khan Konchak and his tribe is colourful and historically informed in one. Needless to say, the scene of the Polovtsian Dances is spectacularly presented with great choregraphy and terrific dancing, in the league of the Spartacus of Bolshoi, no less.","popularity":0.4758,"poster_path":"/e8xwNeBq6gwWBOwFrdGXybLcm5w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71870,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bolshoi Theatre","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":183,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Borodin: Prince igor","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1655679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evgeny Nesterenko","original_name":"Евгений Нестеренко","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":"/xH6gaMXTJB2B3SHzV74fpFE0Mj2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f063be168b766003540af61","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2706424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elena Kurovskaya","original_name":"Elena Kurovskaya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f063bfb5e12000036e2fd9d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1655692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Vedernikov","original_name":"Alexander Vedernikov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/xCCwB0ZWRO0nCZ6xKYBZyrtPzlS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f063c0b0c27100038830c78","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2706425,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mark Ermler","original_name":"Марк Эрмлер","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f063c3a71458f0035cc2f01","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2590432,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alexandr Borodin","original_name":"Alexandr Borodin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f063cdadbf14400330a823b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2706429,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"V.V.
