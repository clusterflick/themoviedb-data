Fathers and Sons tells the story of kangal dogs and their owners. Kangal is a breed of shepherd’s dog, unique to the land of Anatolia. The owners fight their kangals and make money off them from bettings. However, they treat and take care of their dogs like their sons, sometimes even better. Even though their sons may get hurt, a father still takes pride in having sent his son to the military, doesn’t he? Fathers and Sons is about the duality of this father-son relationship. But after all, every father would like to be proud of his son.","popularity":0.5231,"poster_path":"/4Ugv2OszNw2iIcMRzLkudesIaPF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fathers and Sons","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1360577,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kaan Müjdeci","original_name":"Kaan Müjdeci","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/fJI3FS0Pvzx5JDRPxi8urHFt5UB.jpg","credit_id":"5f03d00c53f83300379fdbaf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2704526,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Falko Purner","original_name":"Falko Purner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f03d01cd2b2090039a51b97","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2704527,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Levent Çelebi","original_name":"Levent Çelebi","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f03d0365e12000036e00e63","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2704528,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Efe Akmen","original_name":"Efe Akmen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f03d0418ec4ab00354187d6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1427,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3SIlGGjwxGPRIgdfvVqUbrTtI0F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2537}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"tr","file_path":"/z1FcIt5bSpt7I6GXBxOl6yEOv5F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4Ugv2OszNw2iIcMRzLkudesIaPF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10404,"name":"dog fighting"},{"id":262703,"name":"dog training"},{"id":268507,"name":"kangal dog"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Turkish\", \"english_name\"=>\"Turkish\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"tr\", \"native_name\"=>\"Turkish\"}","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Turkish\", \"english_name\"=>\"Turkish\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"tr\", \"native_name\"=>\"Turkish\"}","note":"Vimeo","release_date":"2017-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"babalar ve Oğulları","key":"9jMh2aTamZs","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2019-07-25T16:46:34.000Z","id":"5f03d22311c0660038b5cff0"}]}}}
