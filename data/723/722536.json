When a rare disease left him housebound for 15 years, Bloom reinvented himself as an author, publishing several books on evolutionary psychology and humanityâ€™s role in the cosmos. Now in his 70s, the eccentric philosopher readies an unfathomably long masterwork that will unify all of his unorthodox theories, and makes plans for his legacy.","popularity":0.7611,"poster_path":"/e77JKXtSaXrSDvhRUMvToK6qIRo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
