Bathed in sunlight and by cold, nutrient-rich waters welling up from the ocean’s depths, this huge submarine forest sustains a complex undersea community.  As you move through the seasons, you'll discover how winds, tides, and currents shape Monterey Bay life. You'll see combat between an octopus and a ferocious moray eel, and watch opalescent squid, borne on cold currents rising from the depths, breed, and die. You’ll behold the miraculous birth of a swell shark and observe male Garibaldi fish constructing elaborate gardens to attract females.","popularity":0.34,"poster_path":"/zYWwGaqxuNskPRoDnpMf5P2Tj0q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seasons in the Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zYWwGaqxuNskPRoDnpMf5P2Tj0q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18330,"name":"nature"},{"id":232412,"name":"underwater world"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"VHS tape has 1990 copyright.","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
