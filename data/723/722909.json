As much as its conflicted terms strive for balance and fusion, it is Blood of Two’s greater resistance to these impulses, its failure to surrender unconditionally to them that ultimately counts, as a network of overlaps and crisscrosses.","popularity":0.2522,"poster_path":"/leZENEJdZGo5aS1Pp2bEW1WheA9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blood of Two","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116018,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Barney","original_name":"Matthew Barney","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":"/d7huIJFX311Q5RiSTgjDvo6FNqy.jpg","credit_id":"5f0645ae68b7660037424df8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2097274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Peyton","original_name":"Elizabeth Peyton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0645f0d5ffcb00337fc87c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292700,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Peter Strietmann","original_name":"Peter Strietmann","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f0646311d1bf40035620a80","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116018,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Barney","original_name":"Matthew Barney","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":"/d7huIJFX311Q5RiSTgjDvo6FNqy.jpg","credit_id":"5f0645c40c271000378240fb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292700,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Peter Strietmann","original_name":"Peter Strietmann","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f06461c0c27100035819374","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116018,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Barney","original_name":"Matthew Barney","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":"/d7huIJFX311Q5RiSTgjDvo6FNqy.jpg","credit_id":"5f06463f61bac400369fdd68","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":866,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/leZENEJdZGo5aS1Pp2bEW1WheA9.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":578},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vbNU0ulDnvADTWpX4Hf0b7JvxvK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.764,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vqFWHdIlYReEIXh3gtERzKaxIyy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":764}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":658,"name":"sea"},{"id":6024,"name":"sculpture"},{"id":11547,"name":"slaughterhouse"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
