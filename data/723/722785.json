Her life is seemingly perfect until her boyfriend's mother purposefully sabotages their relationship. Heartbroken and fragile, Phuong Ly travels to Ho Chi Minh City to work as a cleaner at a marriage agency. There she meets Mitch, one of the men seeking an arranged marriage. He takes a strong interest in her, and coerces her to marry him with the promise that he'll support her family in Vietnam and that she'll receive a better life. However as soon as she arrives in America, Phuong Ly realizes she has been brought as a slave. She is violated and abused with no hope of escape. The only ray of light is the bond she develops with the American's young, autistic niece; both of them prisoners needing to escape.","popularity":0.4344,"poster_path":"/6E86T4HT5CuchBQvUe3ZAhYXHZ1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2950,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bigfoot Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":78240,"logo_path":null,"name":"Giai Phong Film Studio","origin_country":"VN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"VN","name":"Vietnam"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Girl with No Number","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Victim of Circumstance","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":141057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bebe Pham","original_name":"Bebe Pham","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Phuong Ly","credit_id":"5f05bf5d8a0e9b00359df9c4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":215796,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Laisne","original_name":"Jay Laisne","popularity":0.0443,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mitch Mallory","credit_id":"5f05bf6ddd25890037a11972","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":42535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elina Madison","original_name":"Elina Madison","popularity":0.2282,"profile_path":"/hWbeGEFwMMCzLU1VMp39qAskxrD.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Connie Mallory","credit_id":"5f05bf7cd5ffcb00357ebdb7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clint Jung","original_name":"Clint Jung","popularity":0.1311,"profile_path":"/t2XY3xD4HqK1hybw8nsaJkiJlBq.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Vu","credit_id":"5f05bfbf63e6fb003610ffc7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2180227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nguyen Thi Cieu Xuan","original_name":"Nguyen Thi Cieu Xuan","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Kim Ngan","credit_id":"5f05bfdfdd25890039a27d0e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":141059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kersten Hui","original_name":"Kersten Hui","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mr. Chin","credit_id":"5f05bfeddd2589003a9f86ee","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5369082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Huy Nguyen","original_name":"Huy Nguyen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Government Clerk","credit_id":"67fb6505ec22ba3b49d929db","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":107319,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frederick Bailey","original_name":"Frederick Bailey","popularity":0.1277,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f05c02e71458f0037cbe7a1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1516809,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Manh Tuan Nguyen","original_name":"Manh Tuan Nguyen","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f05c03e0c2710003781db0b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141056,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Gleissner","original_name":"Michael Gleissner","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f05c00f1d1bf400366230c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1360843","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6E86T4HT5CuchBQvUe3ZAhYXHZ1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
