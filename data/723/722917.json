He returns to his hometown, and there his former employer, George Simmons, attempts to arrange a match between Chester (who is to inherit a fortune) and his daughter Ethel. Ethel, however, finds Chester unexciting as a lover; and to enliven the affair, the father invents a lurid past for the boy by displaying a signed photograph of Rita Renault, a famous movie star. Rita, accompanied by her jealous husband, Jack Shields, arrives in the town for a personal appearance. By chance, Jack discovers the photograph of Rita, presumably the property of Chester, and when he sees his wife kissing Chester, a running fight ensues.","popularity":0.5567,"poster_path":"/36fHyvdsuM5EFTzhqn209zjnw87.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Whole Town's Talking","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Everett Horton","original_name":"Edward Everett Horton","popularity":0.3955,"profile_path":"/wtoC3cXLStuYmiEUVQavdvbh5Js.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Chester Binney","credit_id":"61cde14fed28b9001c540306","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1031280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Lee Corbin","original_name":"Virginia Lee Corbin","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":"/yf75lIGtaBhkRrcbTEQvFwHdJUN.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Ethel Simmons","credit_id":"61cde15b9affc000422bff3c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":150637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trixie Friganza","original_name":"Trixie Friganza","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":"/4BDX5PJ9LFpPC02fBn25Nm7qLc0.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mrs. George Simmons","credit_id":"61cde1679b6e47009de025df","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Otis Harlan","original_name":"Otis Harlan","popularity":0.1804,"profile_path":"/52f8iXnnQW8iCsO5HzEBtUGHz5X.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"George Simmonns","credit_id":"61cde1749d592c0066b36782","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Ober","original_name":"Robert Ober","popularity":0.1079,"profile_path":"/hWQXHCl3BAqI8IycpkY749e0z3Y.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Donald Montallen","credit_id":"61cde180a1074b001a985c35","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1350022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aileen Manning","original_name":"Aileen Manning","popularity":0.0786,"profile_path":"/wd8hgz9bVxHqH8LLxzAjriFxYoU.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Mrs. Van Loon","credit_id":"61cde18d0d2f530042ca3dcd","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hayden Stevenson","original_name":"Hayden Stevenson","popularity":0.2531,"profile_path":"/wTK7268u3kpQKcxW9gbWzisKfXw.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Tom O'Brien","credit_id":"61cde19a0c3ec8001ce2f29e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1072772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Quimby","original_name":"Margaret Quimby","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/j5pmx9kZiLkJNTekIkEAlhUzTLc.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Sadie Wise","credit_id":"61cde1a63a48c5004259f875","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":31876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dolores del Río","original_name":"Dolores del Río","popularity":0.4595,"profile_path":"/wH6xClLg5dkaJEgpSneASQrRVZ8.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Rita Renault -
