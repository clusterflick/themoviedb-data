This opera is usually performed with a tenor as Romeo, but at La Scala Bellini found a different singing troupe which obliged him to cast not the en travesti warrior of Rossinian manner (like Tancredi, Arsace, Malcolm) but a wholly female Romeo, ardent and authoritative yet at the same time languid, sensual and soft. The choice of this Capuleti at the 2005 Martina Franca Festival was also dictated by the availability of Patrizia Ciofi. This great specialist of romantic belcanto had never been offered the role of Giulietta in Capuleti, a role which is absolutely ideal for her vocal talents.","popularity":0.06,"poster_path":"/zpIpGBBZLt2ED9wa1Vhp4oIER2t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Capuleti e i Montecchi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1437800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrizia Ciofi","original_name":"Patrizia Ciofi","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":"/ijCqvlFvit9TQNzM7sGiOhiIkoM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f04c67b5e12000038e1edad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2705207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clara Polito","original_name":"Clara Polito","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f04c689bb070d003405ebf1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2705208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danilo Formaggia","original_name":"Danilo Formaggia","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f04c6991d1bf4003861b0ee","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2705209,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Federico Sacchi","original_name":"Federico Sacchi","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f04c6a446f3540039266e6b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2705210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicola Amodio","original_name":"Nicola Amodio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f04c6ae5e12000035e088e2","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1609476,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Scalfi","original_name":"Marco Scalfi","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f04c6c9d34eb30038a62a70","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1377913,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Felice Romani","original_name":"Felice Romani","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/3ADAhIAv7prrxVPzVhPjZdiR65B.jpg","credit_id":"5f04c6e10c2710003680a99b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2701074","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.692,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zpIpGBBZLt2ED9wa1Vhp4oIER2t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":519}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2006-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
