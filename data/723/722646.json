The idea of assembling static portraits arose from reading a chapter on \"off-screen space\" - everything that does not appear on the screen but whose absence enhances the shot and the story - in Noël Burch's book Praxis del cine. The film shows the decisive influence of Andy Warhol and Phillipe Garrel's cinema. The soundtrack is by The Velvet Underground and the poster was by the Madrid artist Ceesepe.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/8aJDGsXBtr1fHEAU1Husp63syAe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nomad","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2705630,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ignasi Julià","original_name":"Ignasi Julià","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f053cda68b766003440896e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":888,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8aJDGsXBtr1fHEAU1Husp63syAe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":623},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rETU1MJw5TNzZVtTIkRUPYPNcXZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
