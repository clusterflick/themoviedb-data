This electrifying solo performance kicks off with Skyline Pigeon (taken from 'Empty Sky') before ending with a riotous version of 'Saturday Night's Alright (For Fighting)'. The setlist rips through classic after classic, including 'Rocket Man,' 'Daniel and 'Bennie and the Jets.' It was also the first time Elton performed 'Don't Go Breaking My Heart' solo. Climbing on his piano and stomping his way through this virtuoso performance, Elton leaves every ounce of himself on the stage, in a classic concert that was to be the last time he would perform a full show for another 7 months.","popularity":0.2588,"poster_path":"/77hHodW4RGplwj6iqrATdxhukcY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elton John: In Concert at Edinburgh","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Live at the Playhouse Theatre, Edinburgh","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elton John","original_name":"Elton John","popularity":0.9181,"profile_path":"/9G3k29OWPyZtScEDZEAsFJpqiM7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f0334c4e7868700347e9bc1","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":2082,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/77hHodW4RGplwj6iqrATdxhukcY.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1460},{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":1041,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xCYIe9n1ujTSjER6ZKeoaCDBrv3.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":730}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"YouTube","release_date":"2020-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"LaserVideo","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ABC","release_date":"1977-02-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
