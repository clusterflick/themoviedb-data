In this traditional story, a young owl catches a lemming to eat. Inuit stories are often instructive, and with this fable, children quickly learn the value of being clever and humble, and why pride and arrogance are to be avoided. This short puppet film utilizes composited photographs and a set made with actual Arctic plants and lichen to create an authentic retelling of this ancient Arctic fable. This short film provides a glimpse of traditional Inuit values and beliefs.","popularity":0.1684,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":129662,"logo_path":"/bfvjWlCZfQ98tV7ACX7VtELstJg.png","name":"Taqqut Productions","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Owl and the Lemming","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2705255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Celina Kalluk","original_name":"Celina Kalluk","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5f04d08d46f35400392674f9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2697809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Neil Christopher","original_name":"Neil Christopher","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f04d0bfd5ffcb00347e5c03","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2705256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roselynn Akulukjuk","original_name":"Roselynn Akulukjuk","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f04d09d8a0e9b00349a6e7f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2697809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Neil Christopher","original_name":"Neil Christopher","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f04d0c70c2710003881045d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2705256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roselynn Akulukjuk","original_name":"Roselynn Akulukjuk","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f04d0ac20af770038e6f471","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2705260,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louise Flaherty","original_name":"Louise Flaherty","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f04d0d5a35c8e003821f0c3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6618380","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3355,"name":"inuit"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
