It also featured black-and-white silent footage of a younger Vernon demonstrating sleight-of-hand which we had converted and professionally retouched for the film.  While the film was very well received, it was only available briefly for purchase as a VHS cassette, which was subsequently pirated. The film pops up regularly online, always low-quality copies of copies shared without any credit to those who made the project possible.","popularity":0.2216,"poster_path":"/uEddIpJcPyIaxghgapgP0sZ3zue.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Spirit of Magic","title":"Dai Vernon: The Spirit of Magic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2495718,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dai Vernon","original_name":"Dai Vernon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f05cdfdcffeed0037968db5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricky Jay","original_name":"Ricky Jay","popularity":0.4728,"profile_path":"/xtJvNUSwIOKZ4Z4SDOYjPhvdtIN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f05ce050c2710003882929d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1613047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Maven","original_name":"Max Maven","popularity":0.09,"profile_path":"/vDuQTIMEdCB3yBl5JY4zcHXGj3.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f05ce1bcffeed0037968dc5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2706028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herb Zarrow","original_name":"Herb Zarrow","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f05ce24d5ffcb00347ff0b1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1230551,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John J.
