It became one of the most shocking and mystifying tragedies of all time...  Never again would an ocean liner be as glorified; never again would a ship be considered \"unsinkable\".  Join us in a bold and exciting expedition to the Titanic's resting place 12,500 feet below the surface; a mission as technologically challenging and daring as a trip to the Moon!  Witness explorations in and around the Titanic: the retrieval of a ship's safe, navigation equipment, china, and more; plus interviews with survivors and renowned experts.  It's the complete saga of the Titanic, from construction to catastrophe and finally, discovery... in one compelling home video.","popularity":0.1033,"poster_path":"/xkK8lCPVcyFRBowXd7Wtu7pqNt4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The adventure continues...","title":"Treasures of the Titanic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":178650,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doug Llewelyn","original_name":"Doug Llewelyn","popularity":0.2263,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"601b0416bc8657003fbccfa7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1203516,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Joslyn","original_name":"John Joslyn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f027dd715959f00385b9a53","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":178650,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doug Llewelyn","original_name":"Doug Llewelyn","popularity":0.2263,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f027de98ec4ab00323f5c1c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":77046,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Steve Kroopnick","original_name":"Steve Kroopnick","popularity":0.0737,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f027e067caa470035e24e83","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":77046,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Steve Kroopnick","original_name":"Steve Kroopnick","popularity":0.0737,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f027e19f0317400365e306a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":77046,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Steve Kroopnick","original_name":"Steve Kroopnick","popularity":0.0737,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601b037fd7a70a003c362eae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2963812,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Richard Gibb","original_name":"Richard Gibb","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601b03a6e942ee0042f7a934","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2963813,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Stephen Ball","original_name":"Stephen Ball","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601b03d366a0d300407db630","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3238966","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1818,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xkK8lCPVcyFRBowXd7Wtu7pqNt4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1212}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"Copyright date on the VHS tape is 1988.","release_date":"1988-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
