The story, based on the stories passed down by Smulowitz's mother, grapples with the unspeakable tragedy of the Holocaust while solemnly reminding audiences that the hate that enabled it persists to this day. The film is dedicated to the 11 million lives lost, among them 1.5 million children, promising to remember them and continue to tell their stories.","popularity":0.0954,"poster_path":"/dgAu0epEeFXwNyOyfWwB9kniWUn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-02-06","revenue":20000,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Remember
