Eustache includes in the film the conditions of its production — he is seated at the table with her, pours her some whiskey, speaks with the camera operator, manipulates the clapboard at the head and tail of the reels, and even takes a phone call. Robert, who was seventy-one, speaks rapidly and tells the story of her life, starting from her early childhood in villages in the Bordeaux region of France. A shorter version of the film (\"Odette Robert\") was edited in 1980 to be broadcast on television on TF1.  The complete film only gained exposure in 2002, when it was salvaged by Boris Eustache, Thierry Lounas, João Bénard da Costa, Jean-Marie Straub, and Pedro Costa.","popularity":0.3222,"poster_path":"/8vv2kkZZ4ujMJV8BdHhm7MAtcqo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15261,"logo_path":"/wgKSrQW5yw07bT1TR0iTRO6FD2d.png","name":"Capricci Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Numéro zéro","video":false,"vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Odette Robert","type":"Title of Shortened Version"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53914,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Eustache","original_name":"Jean Eustache","popularity":0.2372,"profile_path":"/8UM9rFEFwrLRS9Felhk38xDJuSV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"600615ef30f79c003d0e38de","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2942308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Odette Robert","original_name":"Odette Robert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"600615f94ca676003f0b4a88","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1179064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boris Eustache","original_name":"Boris Eustache","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60061600420228003ff30ec2","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1473035,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Philippe Théaudière","original_name":"Philippe Théaudière","popularity":1.4,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d5c17925b9550046abba74","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1171032,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adolfo Arrieta","original_name":"Adolfo Arrieta","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":"/d0ny0X1PU7Ona4qzULUDfx3GE08.jpg","credit_id":"60d5c164ef9d72005d9df862","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53914,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Eustache","original_name":"Jean Eustache","popularity":0.2372,"profile_path":"/8UM9rFEFwrLRS9Felhk38xDJuSV.jpg","credit_id":"60061620e942ee003ce6f13f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0261118","wikidata_id":"Q3346371","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/8vv2kkZZ4ujMJV8BdHhm7MAtcqo.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8pNf3G1I27HcRlcgJ96VlDMHYnI.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.681,"height":1409,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/i151QtuiHcjobfyNCkzjaCuWS5Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/5NCUO8x33OlYuhKJOqntM4fC5cS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":254,"name":"france"},{"id":161316,"name":"social documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2009-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Privately screened.
