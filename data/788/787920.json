Rather than provide an easy, murder-mystery style solution to the crimes, the film sets out to explain the social, cultural, and economic factors that have created this situation where these killings can continue, and continue to go unpunished.","popularity":0.0465,"poster_path":"/ypRAk1OT5WUCAq6Ym60uJ1bqDPk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Edge: The Femicide in Ciudad Juarez","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0808406","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":846,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ypRAk1OT5WUCAq6Ym60uJ1bqDPk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
