Sewell, a former Baltimore city homicide investigator and narcotics officer had grown tired of the aggressive tactics used by the Baltimore Police Department...particularly those targeting black communities. Determined to deploy a different approach to law enforcement, Sewell implemented an intensive community policing plan. He and his officers parked their cars and walked the streets. Sewell's system worked: crime plummeted. Residents both black and white became ardent supporters of Sewell's new paradigm of policing. But a conflict was brewing; an ongoing dispute over racial discrimination engulfed Sewell and his officers in a battle that would not only cost them their jobs and professional reputations, but would thrust them into an emotional legal battle that would touch all segments of the community.","popularity":0.0752,"poster_path":"/9qEiHCbEEUOa29cfUqfz5Yss4XL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Friendliest Town","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3076300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelvin Sewell","original_name":"Kelvin Sewell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"608e9ecb71ffdf00566618cf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3076302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Janis","original_name":"Stephen Janis","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"608e9eedf8aee80029077d61","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3076304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diane Downing","original_name":"Diane Downing","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"608e9f0707e28100781ea7cf","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3076302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Janis","original_name":"Stephen Janis","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608e9f5220af77003f73b4ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9038854","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":2226,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9qEiHCbEEUOa29cfUqfz5Yss4XL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1579}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"14A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
