Making this excuse, he goes off with his chums. The wife is an expert swimmer and diver and is invited to attend a meet of the ladies' swimming club, of which she was formerly a member. Her husband's treatment induces her to accept the invitation. The affair takes place at the very beach to which the husband hied himself. One may imagine that hubby has not only plunged into the cooling waters of the surf, but into domestic hot water as well.","popularity":0.31,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1911-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Why He Gave Up","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Mace","original_name":"Fred Mace","popularity":0.0853,"profile_path":"/ahTGVz2AcD9xemfzWpcUdcWVZnt.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Husband","credit_id":"60058cf563e6fb003c041f4d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mabel Normand","original_name":"Mabel Normand","popularity":0.1646,"profile_path":"/7aSeqYhxHaqd0wCHE9yaXu9XWOV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Wife","credit_id":"60058d03719aeb003f4b2b7e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1044969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Dillon","original_name":"Edward Dillon","popularity":0.1626,"profile_path":"/lRWa2M2guVQUo4GCMPComWsds79.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"One of the Husband's Chums","credit_id":"60058d14cb3084003cdfa3a5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1171452,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William J.
