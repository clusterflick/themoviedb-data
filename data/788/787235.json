However, he almost falls for the temptation to go to the mask-ball, inviting an erstwhile lady friend to go with him, telling her that he would dress as a pirate and she to go as a Spanish gypsy. At the sight of his wife's portrait, however, he realizes his intended wrong-doing and changes his mind, asking a friend to go in his stead. The office boy mixes the letters and wifey gets the one he intended for the girl, and she goes to catch her erring hubby. So while hubby waits at home, wifey is keeping her eye on the bold, bad pirate she believes to be her husband.","popularity":0.1509,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":164827,"logo_path":"/9Bh1V6m55hXos3hCLeo8DUW16aH.png","name":"Biograph Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1911-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Through His Wife’s Picture","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Mace","original_name":"Fred Mace","popularity":0.0853,"profile_path":"/ahTGVz2AcD9xemfzWpcUdcWVZnt.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"A Friend","credit_id":"600588e263e6fb003d054219","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mabel Normand","original_name":"Mabel Normand","popularity":0.1646,"profile_path":"/7aSeqYhxHaqd0wCHE9yaXu9XWOV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Wifey","credit_id":"600588f74202280044ef971f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89518,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mack Sennett","original_name":"Mack Sennett","popularity":0.2719,"profile_path":"/24XTSL0AbuT6gzjqAFhpc4fkEts.jpg","credit_id":"6005890d30f79c003e0d8e6e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1119760,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"George Hennessy","original_name":"George Hennessy","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6005891fcb3084003ee0b6b0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0001929","wikidata_id":"Q18464259","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1911-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
