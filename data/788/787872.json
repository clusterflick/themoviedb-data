A fundraiser for The Smell, and a toast to its... scent. [This DVD] captures 10 of the most vital bands to perform at The Smell, downtown LA's essential all-ages venue. With over 2 hours of high-quality live performance footage, this is an essential video document for the alternative / indie / noise-rock fan. From the hyper-active intro by The Mae Shi, through the heavy moods of Gowns, the precise thrash of HEALTH, to the dark techno dystopia of Captain Ahab, Live At The Smell presents a showcase of the excellent music that the community-oriented venue presents on any given day of the week, without booking agents, backroom deals, bouncers, velvet ropes, ID checks, schmoozing, or hype. All footage was shot from Sept-Oct 2008.","popularity":0.0575,"poster_path":"/zjTaBA58b30YT82nnk746MnhmPq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":171707,"logo_path":null,"name":"Coldhandsvideo","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Live At The Smell","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4217556,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brian Miller","original_name":"Brian Miller","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"self","credit_id":"64dfa65937109700ffb9c5e0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4218635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Lee","original_name":"Grace Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"self","credit_id":"64dfa6695ab81a00ad20b3e6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1401936,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jonathan Snipes","original_name":"Jonathan Snipes","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"self","credit_id":"64dfa672b77d4b11425fb67d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1401936,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jonathan Snipes","original_name":"Jonathan Snipes","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62327343d18b2400779533fc","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4221952,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bob Bellerue","original_name":"Bob Bellerue","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dfa6ec3710970139485f2d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":985706,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Cornelius","original_name":"Adam Cornelius","popularity":0.1541,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dfa706e19de900e342e4d0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3031515,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Donovan Vim Crony","original_name":"Donovan Vim Crony","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dfa74f37109700c51e811e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zjTaBA58b30YT82nnk746MnhmPq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
