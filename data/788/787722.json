Their healing rituals are intercessions with the powerful Mluk, the fiercest of the Djiin spirits, whom other Sufi orders avoid. Some consider Gnawa to be an underclass in Moroccan society but they nonetheless play a vital role in its spiritual life. Recorded and filmed in Marrakech in 2005, OULED MAMBARA: PORTRAITS OF GNAWA is an exploration of that role through profiles of some of its most talented musical actors.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/dwuBIildmb8FYWUjAs5YybnIj5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ouled Bambara: Portraits of Gnawa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dwuBIildmb8FYWUjAs5YybnIj5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
