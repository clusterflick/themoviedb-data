The film addresses the story of the destruction of the Palestinian villages of Latroun in the Occupied West Bank and the forcible transfer of their civilian population in 1967. Over 40 years later, the Israeli occupation continues, and villagers remain displaced.  The film follows two separate but parallel journeys. Aisha Um Najeh takes us down the painful road that Palestinians have been forcefully pushed down, separating them in time and place from the land they nurtured; while Israelis walk freely through that land, enjoying its fruits. The stems of the cactus, however, take a few of them to discover the reality of the crime committed.","popularity":0.1537,"poster_path":"/9gRDHffJWuSBfOBW2IQEmfqMiUP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memory of the Cactus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4372728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lillia Arsanova","original_name":"Lillia Arsanova","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65515cf79653f613f3b61a99","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1030593,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Chappell","original_name":"Peter Chappell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65515c7ed4fe0401397ffc7a","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2293911,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Saed Andoni","original_name":"Saed Andoni","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65515cd1d4fe04011b8f40ce","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4372731,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Manaf Abbas","original_name":"Manaf Abbas","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65515d0267b61345ce364e09","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2943915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hanna Musleh","original_name":"Hanna Musleh","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65515c12d4653700fe36c337","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2943915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hanna Musleh","original_name":"Hanna Musleh","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65515cae67b61345cb4bb7c4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4372728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lillia Arsanova","original_name":"Lillia Arsanova","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65515ca09653f613f588394f","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4372728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lillia Arsanova","original_name":"Lillia Arsanova","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65515cbed4653700ab967fc1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4372726,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jimmy Mekel","original_name":"Jimmy Mekel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65515c70fd6fa100fee639c7","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4372719,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Al-Haq","original_name":"Al-Haq","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65515bfdfd6fa100ab969dc9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1683815,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hanna Abu Saada","original_name":"Hanna Abu Saada","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65515c5b25b95500ad75d374","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2943915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hanna Musleh","original_name":"Hanna Musleh","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65515ce0d4fe0400fe03ebcf","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2943915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hanna Musleh","original_name":"Hanna Musleh","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60078b60e488600042729c4c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2870848","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9gRDHffJWuSBfOBW2IQEmfqMiUP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":537,"name":"palestine"},{"id":273967,"name":"war"},{"id":324876,"name":"palestinian diaspora"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Arabic\", \"english_name\"=>\"Arabic\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"ar\", \"native_name\"=>\"Arabic\"}","note":"","release_date":"2008-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
