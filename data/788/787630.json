Gerontius (a name derived from the Greek word geron, \"old man\") is a devout Everyman. Elgar's setting uses most of the text of the first part of the poem, which takes place on Earth, but omits many of the more meditative sections of the much longer, otherworldly second part, tightening the narrative flow.","popularity":0.0997,"poster_path":"/oi4BcWAFQsKL1nZFdKHP3dWnTYy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102793,"logo_path":"/kNELUhi9Tnyw8Od01236QYErqHF.png","name":"ARTE Concert","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Edward Elgar - The Dream of Gerontius","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2388552,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Magdalena Kožená","original_name":"Magdalena Kožená","popularity":0.0805,"profile_path":"/utqYHg2pgMwEEIIrm1oAtHn4jp0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Angel","credit_id":"6006fc47869e75003f85cbc2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1361531,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Relyea","original_name":"John Relyea","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/k0fNi4cMx4mdf8TIY1bCu7AqhRR.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The priest","credit_id":"6006fc83869e75003f85cc2b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1905584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Staples","original_name":"Andrew Staples","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Gerontius","credit_id":"6006fcb8420228003df6b8fa","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1046051,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Edward Elgar","original_name":"Edward Elgar","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6006f0351108a8003e936a04","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1561585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Harding","original_name":"Daniel Harding","popularity":0.0785,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6006f680498bc2003bdadcac","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1662007,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"François-René Martin","original_name":"François-René Martin","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6744d1b280b44a8937b7aa7d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13212690","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yOxvQ5bVutUzZa7oqoLYTMYO0oL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1494,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oi4BcWAFQsKL1nZFdKHP3dWnTYy.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":996},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g88NNgBm7kmRY9Sk0j22nCYv2Ks.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5783,"name":"classical music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
