She, therefore, plans with her cousin to arouse his love through jealousy. At an Italian picnic, after repeated vain efforts to draw her husband's attentions toward her, she starts off with her cousin, passing in view of her husband. His fiery nature is violently aroused with jealousy, and rushing home in a towering rage, would have wreaked disaster to the entire family, for his terrible suspicion poisons his mind even against his two little children. He learns the truth, however, and realizes now to what extreme the result of his neglect would have driven him.","popularity":0.3573,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":164827,"logo_path":"/9Bh1V6m55hXos3hCLeo8DUW16aH.png","name":"Biograph Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1911-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Italian Blood","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1119769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles West","original_name":"Charles West","popularity":0.1267,"profile_path":"/b83aIQMnrWmXxnYm5vbPI1izN7u.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"600587b9813cb6003f57588c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1086784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivian Prescott","original_name":"Vivian Prescott","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/pDIyP1EYqpOBjqNt7phMQz8WpgO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Wife","credit_id":"600587c91108a8003e915e53","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mabel Normand","original_name":"Mabel Normand","popularity":0.1646,"profile_path":"/7aSeqYhxHaqd0wCHE9yaXu9XWOV.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"600587e9223e200040b8e371","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2941646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Greybill","original_name":"Joseph Greybill","popularity":0.0993,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"600587def9a3fb003d36a848","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8819,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Billy Bitzer","original_name":"Billy Bitzer","popularity":0.1214,"profile_path":"/9nNC55iPLBuBK8KwQUoiK06piHW.jpg","credit_id":"631ead280102c900818db1d3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3315616,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bernardine R.
