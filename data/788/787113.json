The Loop and Slides were first created for a live performance at Pix Film Gallery in Toronto. The film loop is accompanied by slides of colours, fragments of images, words that act as inter-titles, creating echoes between the film's continuous vertical movement and the stillness of the fixed slide.  The found sound is a poem written by Italian beat poet Massimo Mori in 1980, from a collection of poetry created between Italy and Quebec, Canada.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/5L1Lws22QW35PxVlNNSKQ1uioFh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Colonna Continua","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2773786,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Federica Foglia","original_name":"Federica Foglia","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/lDWBsWmry9JI9TKXvHX62UUbq9I.jpg","credit_id":"6004d6e9b0040a004093fcb7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1324,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5L1Lws22QW35PxVlNNSKQ1uioFh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":881}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
