The 70's evolve into a tweaky sound track by Knox Bronson, electronic culture mastermind, with scenes from McKay's world travels in a highly abstracted form. The 80's movement travels into pure geometric and color abstractions, with an uplifting electronic/acoustic soundtrack by Dean Evenson. McKayâ€™s 90's movement goes deep into fantastic liquid color landscapes with a dark, electronic music voyage crafted in collaboration with McKay by Greg Jalbert.  This video captures McKay's main installation piece at a retrospective of four decades of his work at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, February-May 1999.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/blzQOi778gFW9uUbycFwMzBm43x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Altered States (1966-1999)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2944149,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Glenn McKay","original_name":"Glenn McKay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6007d171af2da8003c910162","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2944150,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dennis Keefe","original_name":"Dennis Keefe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6007d1862d531a00565fb18d","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2944151,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"George Rosenfeld","original_name":"George Rosenfeld","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6007d19c3f8ede00425ddecc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/blzQOi778gFW9uUbycFwMzBm43x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
