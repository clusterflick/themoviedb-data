And yet the man bearing that name was visited by misfortune of all kinds: lost love, loneliness, hearing loss... Even so, he was able to produce his Ninth Symphony featuring the singing of \"Ode to Joy.\" But how?  Silk Road - From west to east, from east to west, the Silk Road, a trade route carrying culture, civilization, and people, connected Western Europe with Asia over land and sea.  A bandit preying on merchants traveling the route obtains a blue diamond. However, it is in fact the lost eye of the Indian goddess Sita. The jewel has changed hands on countless occasions, at times bringing good fortune to its owner, at other times tragic doom. Having roamed the Silk Road since the long distant past, the Eye of Sita invites the bandit on a journey through the copious memories dwelling behind its dazzling facets.","popularity":0.3761,"poster_path":"/whLtg5AuoVJ1BAdS1D8lpwZhvfh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102631,"logo_path":null,"name":"Takarazuka Revue
