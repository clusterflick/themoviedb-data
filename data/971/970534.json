The people of Ova Himba were cattle herders, who followed the rains and knew where to find water and vegetation. They migrated between their encampments, the women repairing the huts with cow dung. Chief Kamasuthu, his mother, children and three wives always lived in the manner prescribed by their ancestors. They ground ocre with butterfat and herbs and decorated their bodies with this deep-hued mixture. This honored the fine cattle of their ancient gods. The drought and the war in Angola forced them into shanty towns and took away their dignity. Their children grew scornful of the old ways. This ancient, nomadic tribe, which had been untouched by the 20th century, now faces an uncertain future.","popularity":0.0589,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ocre People: Nomads of Namibia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3534005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abraham Vorster","original_name":"Abraham Vorster","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6270793c6f53e11b4d1c2a14","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3534006,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ana Roth Vorster","original_name":"Ana Roth Vorster","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6270794ed13324113e2efa20","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
