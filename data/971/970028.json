The songs reference the Navajo Long Walk, the Trail of Tears and resulting drownings in the Arkansas and Mississippi Rivers, and the removal of the Seminole people from their homelands. Chacon describes: “These songs of resistance, with only a snare drum as accompaniment, become a sonic testimony, an acknowledgement of shared survival, and a healing call in their mother tongues.”","popularity":0.0579,"poster_path":"/5Lxr84V5udVPuRnhB5mrHmtBEIo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Songs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2501899,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raven Chacon","original_name":"Raven Chacon","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"626f1720d55e4d0065ded8ab","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2501899,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raven Chacon","original_name":"Raven Chacon","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626f1735903c52004fe66344","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2501899,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raven Chacon","original_name":"Raven Chacon","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626f173ac74eba2e0a6a5144","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2501899,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raven Chacon","original_name":"Raven Chacon","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626f1717903c52009a9d75dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2501899,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raven Chacon","original_name":"Raven Chacon","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626f1727d133240050371406","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":986,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5Lxr84V5udVPuRnhB5mrHmtBEIo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":657}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
