The film imagines the traumatised body as a functioning time machine where gaps between timelines and anomalies cause the present-day body to disappear and is replaced by the bodyâ€™s memory of past trauma. The film weaves a narrative from mental time travel, episodic future thinking (a projection of the self into the future to pre-experience an event) and PTSD.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dissolving Beyond the Worm Moon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3222052,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bassam Al-Sabah","original_name":"Bassam Al-Sabah","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6270529dc74eba2e09da3472","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
