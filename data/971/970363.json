The program also introduces viewers to a cross-section of mangaka icons: Vagabond creator Takehiko Inoue; Naoki Urasawa, author of The Pushman and Other Stories; Jiro Taniguchi; Yoshihiro Tatsumi; and Kan Takahama.","popularity":0.3633,"poster_path":"/wNVtvLapYjeHpocIjsN0OUUx1lB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170726,"logo_path":null,"name":"Génération Vidéo","origin_country":""},{"id":24033,"logo_path":"/dZ7shHqHbMAD05hQPzYgz5OAKwl.png","name":"France 5","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2005-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manga World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1898633,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Takehiko Inoue","original_name":"井上雄彦","popularity":0.2678,"profile_path":"/omtKRZenowcgI4azZSWuATShj5G.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62701502c56d2d6f74860fd7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3533561,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kan Takahama","original_name":"Kan Takahama","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62701558903c52188475396f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236137,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jirô Taniguchi","original_name":"Jirô Taniguchi","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6270156aa24c50393bd5c643","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58160,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Osamu Tezuka","original_name":"手塚治虫","popularity":0.918,"profile_path":"/4xOgZySBani7h7xkFwK4Rf0MqNg.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self (archive)","credit_id":"62701592903c521884753a0c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115936,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Naoki Urasawa","original_name":"浦沢直樹","popularity":0.202,"profile_path":"/xpXOtyO3gvJZbnRfwhXDBeeVwEP.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"627015a4903c521884753a62","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2200671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoshihiro Tatsumi","original_name":"辰巳ヨシヒロ","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"627016e27cffda7316bba580","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1408020,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hervé Martin-Delpierre","original_name":"Hervé Martin-Delpierre","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6270172912aabc00674b57fc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1408020,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hervé Martin-Delpierre","original_name":"Hervé Martin-Delpierre","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62701738d13324113f9bfdc7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1895855,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Jerome Schmidt","original_name":"Jerome Schmidt","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"627017546f53e11b4d1a7794","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13989086","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1684,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wNVtvLapYjeHpocIjsN0OUUx1lB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1190}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
