In a series she began making in 2018, Mira reflects on how mythology intersects with contemporary lived experiences of violence, colonialism and desire. Mira’s installation includes footage of her performing as a tiger in the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea, a ritual at the site of late artist Theresa Hak Kyung Cha’s 1982 murder, as well as a radio broadcast that has been transmitting in her studio from an unknown source. Informed by spiritual practices and shamanism—Mira’s great-grandmother lived as a shaman during the period of the Japanese occupation of Korea when it was outlawed—the works are radically open-ended, guided by circumstance and direct embodied experience.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/w95XrXhDRQ5fy9CB4LxO6ARBwMp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night Vision (Red as never been)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3532736,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Na Mira","original_name":"Na Mira","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626f3d2565e0a2009ce40520","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w95XrXhDRQ5fy9CB4LxO6ARBwMp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
