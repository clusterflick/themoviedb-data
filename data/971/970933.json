He screams, falls, lies, is cut into pieces, shot or commits suicide. Again and again his empty gaze, again and again his rigid body. In 54 years as an actor, Udo Kier played in more than 170 feature films, 120 series episodes and 50 short films. More than 70 times Udo Kier tried to give an expression to dying and death. In Staging Death, these representations of death merge into a montage of the most diverse shots, film formats, special effects and sound designs.  \"Directors are now thinking increasingly strained about what new ways they can kill me. [â€¦] At some point, somebody would have to make a montage of all my film deaths.\" Udo Kier (Interview Subway Magazine #145, December 1999)","popularity":0.228,"poster_path":"/vvGsoDQWoxjK4hxNh4XCIJfJBax.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2022-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Udo Kier dies his way through film history.","title":"Staging Death","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Udo Kier","original_name":"Udo Kier","popularity":1.106,"profile_path":"/8bD9dTPML8JZgkCzUu2tUN8byOG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6273a29da313b82f746dfa66","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1295176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Soldat","original_name":"Jan Soldat","popularity":0.0534,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62714d3de19de900654c9574","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1295176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Soldat","original_name":"Jan Soldat","popularity":0.0534,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6273a2a5c0442918de97cab9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1295176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Soldat","original_name":"Jan Soldat","popularity":0.0534,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6273a2ac06f984005081e963","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt20223306","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vvGsoDQWoxjK4hxNh4XCIJfJBax.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cannes Film Festival","release_date":"2022-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jeonju International Film Festival","release_date":"2023-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
