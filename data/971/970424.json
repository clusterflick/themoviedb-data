These \"foreign correspondents\" invade CNN's broadcasts of the war with their own analyses of events. Through dramatic monologues, interviews, eulogies and political rants, the tape documents the emotional toll on individuals as it simultaneously forms a critique of satellite technology, logo culture and other aspects of The New World Order.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Serenade to CNN","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3533684,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred Bacher","original_name":"Fred Bacher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62702f148c7b0f0069de3ce3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
