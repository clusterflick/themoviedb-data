Pendleton has explained that these works “verge on the monumental; they can take months to make and capture a deep history of marks and impressions. Minor moments become major moments because of how they articulate who we are or who we might be at any given moment. It’s a visual poetics of disruption.” These paintings, Pendleton has suggested, ask: “how do you leverage, subvert, and deploy your subjectivity? We all are doing it all of the time. It becomes more interesting when we’re aware that we’re doing it.”","popularity":0.0757,"poster_path":"/iRCbyYLMMbvUDYsW3ZwDQHCnGSU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ruby Nell Sales","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3175220,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Pendleton","original_name":"Adam Pendleton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626f2609245dbe3380762b16","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1266520,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Chayse Irvin","original_name":"Chayse Irvin","popularity":0.1876,"profile_path":"/26x366VuS7B0weTTN6Tn0y9wFWh.jpg","credit_id":"6528614f1f3e6000e28ecdc3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1989628,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Grason Caldwell","original_name":"Grason Caldwell","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652860fc1f3e6000ac4cfd10","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2374130,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Myriam Schroeter","original_name":"Myriam Schroeter","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653006de945d36010c3576fc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":939444,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sierra Pettengill","original_name":"Sierra Pettengill","popularity":0.1568,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653007120b74e900c47bfb7f","department":"Editing","job":"Archival Footage Research"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2157,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iRCbyYLMMbvUDYsW3ZwDQHCnGSU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1438}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
