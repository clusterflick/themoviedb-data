This documentary brings this group of people in the limelight, discussing the value of art space in bookshops. The book-loving director Kong King Chu visited independent bookshops in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia for three to four years, tried to understand how a bookshop can become a dynamic, inspiring and heartwarming space, even these booksellers carry different attitude towards life, books and community, as well as management beliefs. These booksellers do not care about the commercial value emphasized by the capitalist society and they are content in their own way by sharing their enthusiasm about books with the others in spite of all difficulties. Thus, they keep trying new methods to sharpen their touch on social issues and become an important starting point for the general public to reflect upon conflicts in our society.","popularity":0.2816,"poster_path":"/bluMTPxshRoMFLiHdVrzRbWLaMB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2020-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ode to Book People","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3212218,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kong King-chu","original_name":"Kong King-chu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626fc51cc56d2d6f7484d566","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"odetobookpeople","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bluMTPxshRoMFLiHdVrzRbWLaMB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":817,"name":"bookshop"},{"id":4224,"name":"singapore"},{"id":6847,"name":"malaysia"},{"id":12354,"name":"hong kong"},{"id":281237,"name":"independent film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Online Premiere","release_date":"2020-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hong Kong Indie Film Festival","release_date":"2021-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Southeast Asian Premiere, Singapore Chinese Film Festival","release_date":"2022-05-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"《书人颂》Ode to Book People  | 新加坡华语电影节 2022","key":"2OFBwDIEmvo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-04-13T04:00:00.000Z","id":"626fc4b06f53e11b4c0cf840"}]}}}
