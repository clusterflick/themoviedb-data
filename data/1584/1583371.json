Ultimately, it offers no definitive answers but instead positions the viewer on the very threshold where the artists stand: the threshold between what we know and what we are yet to discover. It is there, where the sand becomes memory, the image an indelible trace, and identity a promise renewed with every glance. This is a film about art as a state of life, and the human beings seeing themselves in a sketch that takes shape only to gradually fade away — as if beauty is not drawn to endure, but rather to offer a reminder that everything we seek... may, in fact, reside within the drawing of the sand itself.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/j1Vs5ZzJox6tuNeuSqUzRAOLNKf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SA","name":"Saudi Arabia"}],"release_date":"2025-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Beyond the Shifting Sands","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5825242,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Abdullah Al-Hamdi","original_name":"Abdullah Al-Hamdi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691cd0db7efb404abb0b7ead","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5825242,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Abdullah Al-Hamdi","original_name":"Abdullah Al-Hamdi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691cd0e3d9db9e988ef629fb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5825244,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Omar Al-Bawardi","original_name":"Omar Al-Bawardi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691cd0eee88cdcf2ac0b7e54","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2000,"iso_3166_1":"SA","iso_639_1":"ar","file_path":"/j1Vs5ZzJox6tuNeuSqUzRAOLNKf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1414}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Red Sea International Film Festival","release_date":"2025-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
