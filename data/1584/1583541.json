Her story is linked to the disappearance in advance of an exhibition of the artist “Angela Su,” the construction of electromagnetic portals between worlds, and a series of unexplained events on the mysterious, mist-shrouded island of the work’s title…  Combining clips from filmmakers as varied as Georges Méliès, Hans Richter, Luis Buñuel, and the choreographer Busby Berkeley, Su builds an alternative reality out of unsettling correspondences, secret patterns, psychographic messages, and dream logics. The viewer is invited to take a “leap of faith” into worlds beyond ordinary perception that, for all their strangeness, hold up a mirror to the violence and injustice that shape our own.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/8xVTQgPIKjTukXLsSVQe0ySEpAX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lacrima","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3599199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angela Su","original_name":"Angela Su","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691d35576165f03d157ad668","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8xVTQgPIKjTukXLsSVQe0ySEpAX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
