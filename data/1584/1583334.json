As the stage manager for her high school's production, she finds joy in the precise coordination of the show's moving parts. However, on opening night, just five minutes before the curtains rise, the unexpected happens-the lead actress, Kelly, is missing. Desperate to save the show, Layla turns to Tina, the understudy, only to find her too sick to perform. With no other option, Jill, Kelly's bold and supportive friend, suggests the unthinkable: Layla should take the stage.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Places in 5!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36733114","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
