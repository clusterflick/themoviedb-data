Tormented by obsessive stalker fans and malicious online comments, he lives in isolation, cut off from the world. One day, his only family—his grandmother—asks him to find Santos, a Philippine veteran who once saved her during the Korean War. With his long-time manager and best friend Junha by his side, Woojin sets off for the Philippines. At Manila Airport, he unexpectedly meets Gabby, a mysterious young woman and longtime fan of his, who eagerly offers to help. Soon, Gabby’s best friend, the vibrant and quirky influencer Lara, joins them, and an unplanned journey begins.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/xupJxQMmzWf4pxXzTLsOKgFXD3A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":280783,"logo_path":null,"name":"SBTown","origin_country":""},{"id":280784,"logo_path":null,"name":"GV Entertainment Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2025-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A message delivered 75 years later","title":"Finding Santos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4762260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theo Jang","original_name":"장태오","popularity":0.349,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Woojin","credit_id":"691c606438d5a26522c7d4ea","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5824536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maeg Medina","original_name":"Maeg Medina","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Gabby","credit_id":"691c60b1ed5d1922a86d9a35","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5824539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Park Seong-in","original_name":"Park Seong-in","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Junha","credit_id":"691c610944b1110edd609c60","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5824541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Galendez","original_name":"Hans Galendez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Lara","credit_id":"691c612a8a391265365e0466","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1563782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Son Hyeon-woo","original_name":"Son Hyeon-woo","popularity":0.1161,"profile_path":"/gKUIUHbrCWo6PZiyjcK0BcenKL1.jpg","credit_id":"691c5f0df1156e7efc5e0367","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5824528,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Han Gyeong-seong","original_name":"Han Gyeong-seong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691c5fafd11cb8decbc7d3f5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5824530,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Park Cho-rong","original_name":"Park Cho-rong","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691c5fc88951c72deb5e0457","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5824532,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paik Seung-sook","original_name":"Paik Seung-sook","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691c5fe20fd6103e83446ed5","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5824528,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Han Gyeong-seong","original_name":"Han Gyeong-seong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691c5ff4ce430394eb5e0577","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt38582936","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"61575715736958","instagram_id":"findingsantosph","twitter_id":"FindingSantosPH"},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2048,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xupJxQMmzWf4pxXzTLsOKgFXD3A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1382}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Quezon City","release_date":"2025-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"'Finding Santos' Official Trailer | Jang Theo, Maegan Gabrielle Medina, Park Seongin, Hans Galendez","key":"wgr1CCJFoMk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-11-05T11:01:50.000Z","id":"691c6048ce430394eb5e0581"}]}}}
