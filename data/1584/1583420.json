Now retired, he makes wooden caravans like the ones he spent his childhood in. He tells us about life on the road with his large family, the death of his father when he was fourteen and the need to provide for his family, his marriage and the birth of his children. As the nomadic life became less and less compatible with modern society, Antoine gradually settled down, not without regret; he currently lives in a house in the Belgian countryside but keeps trailers and a caravan to go back on the road whenever possible.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1Pq1eVDpgAcUtodFBJ7pkXJdmJv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67737,"logo_path":null,"name":"Camera-etc","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2015-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les verdines d'Antoine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1927325,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Nelissen","original_name":"David Nelissen","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691ce62003fdc15920110c40","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1535039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Delphine Hermans","original_name":"Delphine Hermans","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691ce62d6257ba465debc1d2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5825472,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"François Petit","original_name":"François Petit","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691ce661d4ef9dd779b7d6f0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1125489,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jean-Luc Slock","original_name":"Jean-Luc Slock","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691ce671ab73c3d0dd0d5e04","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18817002","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1Pq1eVDpgAcUtodFBJ7pkXJdmJv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
