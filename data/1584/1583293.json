Simon is only three days away from his Bar Mitzvah and the nightmares are getting worse. This Saturday, he becomes a man in the eyes of Judaism. His Father, recently divorced, is on a religious journey of his own. Heartbroken by his ex-wife’s remarriage, Simon’s father has become an orthodox Jew. He spends his days wrapped in Tefillin, and cloaked in his Tallis.  As Simon’s Father urges him towards blind faith rather than understanding, Simon finds himself haunted by his Torah portion and by his fear of dropping the Torah.  As his Bar Mitzvah grows closer, Simon’s nightmares grow more vivid. As the day arrives, Simon is called forth in front of the entire congregation to deliver his Torah Portion, and to share his beliefs with the community. His father watches on, desperate to see his son take the same path as him.","popularity":0.0786,"poster_path":"/dDIB2QwwZr06VYsMwP4hILnp9c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":280819,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fried Fish Films","origin_country":""},{"id":280820,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jack and Grace Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Don't drop the Torah.","title":"Unraveled","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2625454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joel Widman","original_name":"Joel Widman","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Dad","credit_id":"691cb2c977f6b20061ebc132","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bern Cohen","original_name":"Bern Cohen","popularity":0.2033,"profile_path":"/8AXxKLCEnC6IuWOYocw4SJwUmqO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Rabbi Rosenfeld","credit_id":"691cb2d3a5929c8bcaa23fb6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1237560,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chris Dooly","original_name":"Chris Dooly","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Tommy","credit_id":"691cb2e4358d959473ebc123","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5825051,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zin Kassel","original_name":"Zin Kassel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Simon","credit_id":"691cb2f131b6b767deebc12e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5825052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Fried","original_name":"Karen Fried","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Mom","credit_id":"691cb2fbe88cdcf2ac0b7d9d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1262808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yale Fried","original_name":"Yale Fried","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691cb319640392cfc675fe0b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1262808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yale Fried","original_name":"Yale Fried","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691cb329434283b31475fe24","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4019238,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chris Salerno","original_name":"Chris Salerno","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691cb33be02df54959f62980","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5777763,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liv Boren","original_name":"Liv Boren","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691cb34942b074631468572a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1237560,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chris Dooly","original_name":"Chris Dooly","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691cb354ef769d1d3868572a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5825055,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Isaak Popkin","original_name":"Isaak Popkin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691cb37b640392cfc675fe1c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34913634","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rG9DaGv4ebAfUsH1SG4btquWRVS.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dDIB2QwwZr06VYsMwP4hILnp9c.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3903,"name":"bar mitzvah"},{"id":10683,"name":"coming of age"},{"id":251667,"name":"anxious"},{"id":274920,"name":"jewish"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"World Premiere at Dances With Films","release_date":"2025-06-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Unraveled Short Film (Official Trailer)","key":"1072278085","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-04-03T17:49:10.000Z","id":"691cb3d6eba9c8ca94685725"}]}}}
