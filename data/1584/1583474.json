This consumerism is illustrated through portrayals of our feeding, mating, and grooming habits, as well as ritual gatherings and retirement that manufacture a dependency on the capitalist system. Burman’s highly fantasized stop-motion claymation critiques the absurdity of integrating capitalism and humanity, which has altered the human experience into a measurement of one’s ability to mass produce and mass consume.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Modern Day Consumer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3459356,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brian Burman","original_name":"Brian Burman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691d0ae1343a2fde380d5f0a","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3459356,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brian Burman","original_name":"Brian Burman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691d0ae7cffb29e125110d13","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3459356,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brian Burman","original_name":"Brian Burman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691d0afab26e507832b7d674","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":592,"name":"capitalism"},{"id":7025,"name":"industrial revolution"},{"id":10907,"name":"consumerism"},{"id":202647,"name":"humanity"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Modern Day Consumer  (Animated Film by Brian Burman)","key":"8XAwSDRlfp0","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2020-12-23T16:28:44.000Z","id":"691d0b7b715e4b226a0b7e64"}]}}}
