When Anahí crosses its threshold, each encounter with creatures is not a matter of chance, but a challenge to her own innocence. These creatures are much more than fantastical, dreamlike beings; they are the embodiment of humanity's primal forces that both guide and confound us: desire, vanity, and mystery. In this dreamlike journey, the true territory to conquer is not the forest itself, but the path from innocence to life.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2025-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Anahí en la orilla","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5825141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lola Eihhorst","original_name":"Lola Eihhorst","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Anahí","credit_id":"691cc0c08a30386049110be8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5825142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elina Angel","original_name":"Elina Angel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Anahí","credit_id":"691cc0cc79b666ea4d0d5d85","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5825143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elias Gabriel Orsini","original_name":"Elias Gabriel Orsini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Fauno","credit_id":"691cc0d5eba9c8ca946857b4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5825145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pamela Lima Aquino","original_name":"Pamela Lima Aquino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Ninfas","credit_id":"691cc0db6991a253d60b7d94","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5825146,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florencia Lenardon","original_name":"Florencia Lenardon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Ninfas","credit_id":"691cc0e129ae0434d10b7de0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5825148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betania Ambroggio","original_name":"Betania Ambroggio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Ninfas","credit_id":"691cc0e829ae0434d10b7dea","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4273568,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Matías Prete","original_name":"Matías Prete","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691cc0a56dd312addbb7d5f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5825140,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Esequiel Francisco Montel","original_name":"Esequiel Francisco Montel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691cc0b86dd312addbb7d601","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2025-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
