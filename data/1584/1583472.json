She vicariously experiences her dreams of romance and adventure through the female protagonist of her favorite soap opera. The film intermixes the fantasy world of the television program with the reality of the Emilia's daily life, exploring the profound sense of dissatisfaction and acute feelings of entrapment experienced by women within society's traditional roles. There is not much difference between Emilia's \"real\" life and her soap opera life in that the woman is confined in both environments.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":280845,"logo_path":null,"name":"Broadbeard Productions Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"No Video Found","title":"My Sin Is Loving You","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Mi Pecado Es Quererte","type":"Spanish Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5825604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Euridice Arratia","original_name":"Euridice Arratia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"691d08ba2ce3796d4d0d5f33","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5825605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Cole","original_name":"Robert Cole","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"691d08c7456e389d18b7d758","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5825606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Perhach","original_name":"Linda Perhach","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"691d08d329b786a7a6ebc373","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3448825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evan R.
