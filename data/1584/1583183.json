He decided to step away for a while and focus on creating his next work, Nascimento. To promote the album, he developed a tour with Gabriel Villela. With sets designed by Villela and Milton himself directing, the show symbolized the singer’s own rebirth. Dancers who also played percussion surrounded him onstage, performing around a giant drum at the center—an altar-like platform where Milton remained throughout the performance.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/rh43pca6zZ5vYbqFRcspeFcz38o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2003-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Milton Nascimento \"Tambores de Minas\"","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1101310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milton Nascimento","original_name":"Milton Nascimento","popularity":0.1079,"profile_path":"/kIePvGvbCfK9oBW98xCZZuK8Tx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"691c86e061a74647bf44703a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1101310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milton Nascimento","original_name":"Milton Nascimento","popularity":0.1079,"profile_path":"/kIePvGvbCfK9oBW98xCZZuK8Tx.jpg","credit_id":"691c86b6a9f4edc6d5609d76","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1751159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriel Villela","original_name":"Gabriel Villela","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691c86cf61a74647bf44702f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0391344","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rh43pca6zZ5vYbqFRcspeFcz38o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2003-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Milton Nascimento - Tambores de Minas (1999) DVD COMPLETO","key":"coV27zA-Un0","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2024-12-12T00:08:35.000Z","id":"691c876261a74647bf447042"}]}}}
