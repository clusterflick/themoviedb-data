As Richard cares for his partner, he is forced to confront a buried childhood trauma: the helplessness of watching his mother die. This hybrid film becomes an intimate portrait of love, loss, and the ghosts we carry, weaving a raw, emotional journey through memory, imagination, and the fear of failing those we love most.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/tyq7POnMZdPLgh1LDsnxe4x7q1i.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"}],"release_date":"2025-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Under My Mother's Roof","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5015201,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Christian Abboud","original_name":"Christian Abboud","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691db452e71ef393a6fc1f70","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1152,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tyq7POnMZdPLgh1LDsnxe4x7q1i.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Amman International Film Festival","release_date":"2025-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
