These two tribes have long had differences. Their dispute is about access to salt, which is absolutely impossible for one of them to obtain. As a result, despite much hardship and effort in fishing, due to the lack of salt to preserve the caught fish, their product constantly spoils before it reaches the market, which has led to numerous conflicts. Suddenly, two loves emerge. The roots of discord and hatred push these two loves to the brink of destruction, but ultimately it is love that, after years of conflict, brings the two tribes closer together.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/fSKU6nxz7TRpEiaV9vEbfOC162J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"1965-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Salt Pan Fishermen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":39832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vida Ghahremani","original_name":"Vida Ghahremani","popularity":0.7253,"profile_path":"/sN0pDopEd7ARLsd75z3GOirxL4b.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"691c91e2a6a597bf9f6d9a05","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4874213,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mohammad Reza Fazeli","original_name":"Mohammad Reza Fazeli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"691c9202c35d05db1c0b6529","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2568879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saeed Kamyar","original_name":"Saeed Kamyar","popularity":0.0608,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"691c920aaa67fcbcb9609fe7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2575946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akbar Hashemi","original_name":"Akbar Hashemi","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"691c92136bba104cce17687a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2245170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ali Azad","original_name":"Ali Azad","popularity":0.1861,"profile_path":"/kg253frjtiZitjZ7QWP52lBRDoz.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"691c9316af0ccbe5d481c6ef","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5824825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hossein Shahin","original_name":"Hossein Shahin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"691c933470eda0bda30b6542","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5824827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Minoo Malekpoor","original_name":"Minoo Malekpoor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"691c93411d8911ca60c7d5bb","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5346876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simin","original_name":"Simin","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/c3B6zSkjg1dXufSIgVlNJPsQE7r.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"691c934b68d7c4beb5447300","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3686483,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Karim Neshat","original_name":"Karim Neshat","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"691c935443005e5cb6447137","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2575946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akbar Hashemi","original_name":"Akbar Hashemi","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691c936243005e5cb644713e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2575946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akbar Hashemi","original_name":"Akbar Hashemi","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691c936f75172af20fc7d53b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2575946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akbar Hashemi","original_name":"Akbar Hashemi","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691c93dfa5a42cfff652f0b4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3688397,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Reza Anjamruz","original_name":"Reza Anjamruz","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691c93fd331a76ce2e0b64c9","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Department Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fSKU6nxz7TRpEiaV9vEbfOC162J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1965-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
