It was filmed in August 2011 during Ramadan.  Obscurity is the basic element in this movie, it is an artistic thought through choice. It represents the obscurity in telling the truth about the conversation taking place between the regime in power, and the people on the ground, and the obscurity in reporting the conflict between both voices: the voice of the regime/gunshots, and that of the people/songs  This movie walks into the obscurity in Syria and strike opens those doors the regime has closed.  It starts in obscurity and ends in broad daylight,  exactly like what will happen in Syria right after the revolution","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SY","name":"Syrian Arab Republic"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Homs: the chant of survival","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5569390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"abdolbaseit al sarut","original_name":"abdolbaseit al sarut","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"self","credit_id":"6878608ff41b3792340623d3","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":355467,"name":"عبدالباسط الساروت"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
