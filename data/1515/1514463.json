He attempts to make a film that doesn't have the normal 16mm frame.  He also doesn't respect standard recording principles.  Thus, a distinction must be made between:  - the real time during which he films the object (himself) through his camera.  - the time the film is recorded.  These two periods do not always correspond to real time.  The image must illustrate the search for these different notions of time.  To achieve this, he experiments and places a 16mm film on top of a 35mm film during the shooting.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/u9qYlJmUijBeDF8KfzZE1iGYfEq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frameless 16","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575125,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jun'ichi Okuyama","original_name":"Jun'ichi Okuyama","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/yE2u1iLL1gSVElJGbKzZeErqrDc.jpg","credit_id":"68781ce9a9cbb51acbba830d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2117,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u9qYlJmUijBeDF8KfzZE1iGYfEq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1411}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
