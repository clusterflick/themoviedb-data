Far from everything he once knew, he’s haunted by nostalgia and memories of his childhood in Jordan.  As the silence grows louder, he begins to battle creeping thoughts, isolation, and the quiet psychological toll of displacement. What was meant to be a new beginning slowly turns into a mental trap—where the past, the present, and his sense of self start to blur.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/g6K29wWA856zxiZ4x6QXAHvbhqD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":268275,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ddline","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JO","name":"Jordan"}],"release_date":"2025-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Execution is Tomorrow","title":"The Execution is Tomorrow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JO","title":"بكرا الإعدام","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"ar","file_path":"/g6K29wWA856zxiZ4x6QXAHvbhqD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"Available on YouTube","release_date":"2025-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
