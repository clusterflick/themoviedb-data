Robert tells Barney that he has always wanted to be able to stay up all night long just to see what happens at nighttime. The kids are in for some nighttime fun during the day with the help of Barney's special \"Night Timer\". When the lights go down, they all imagine that it is nighttime and get ready for bed by taking a bath, putting on their pajamas, and brushing their teeth. Barney teaches the kids that there are some unusual sights and sounds associated with nighttime. After singing some of their favorite \"nighttime\" songs, the stars begin to fade and before they know it, the morning sun is shining once again.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/zWTJ0ZGA0umuDoHhSb430IY8L4T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Barney's Good Day, Good Night","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2046,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zWTJ0ZGA0umuDoHhSb430IY8L4T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1364}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
