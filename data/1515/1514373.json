Hikorinus is a complex boy who has spent his life battling the demonic legacy of his family. His power lies in banishing dark entities and protecting the world from demonic invasion. Karella, on the other hand, was born with a potent demonic force, able to shift her form and infiltrate the worlds of horror beings. When Karella returns to Tononiki, ancient powers begin to awaken. Their bloodline hides many secrets and curses tied to a legendary artifact—the Devil’s Iron, which can rewrite the fate of the Abenenar family and the entire world. At the same time, a formidable emissary of the demon king and queen arrives in the village—Hin-Tson-Kim, tasked with returning Karella to the dark lineage and punishing Hikorinus for betraying their blood.","popularity":0.0929,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":266584,"logo_path":null,"name":"CCY Studios","origin_country":""},{"id":267689,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kanyon Animation Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":267503,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Osatsi","origin_country":""},{"id":268195,"logo_path":null,"name":"LegendsARR Productions Entertaiment LLC","origin_country":""},{"id":268060,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tricksol","origin_country":""},{"id":268061,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tricksol Co.
