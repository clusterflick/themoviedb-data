The customers are regulars, workers and prostitutes who seem to be killing time, oblivious to the surrounding transformations.  Shipwrecked characters, at once grandiloquent and sincere, converge here every day as the construction progresses. By following their three sinuous destinies, the film questions the uncertain sociality they construct in this suspended place, and which they manage to wrest from their own reality.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/xszxnIFKR7LMZRUsMafDNzbbd7W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97760,"logo_path":"/4ZKbXGBg1aR6PuNjw8SGf55USq7.png","name":"Dublin Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"En attendant les filles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3006618,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rémy Jantin","original_name":"Rémy Jantin","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6877b38c31ecef3ec96ab3c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3006618,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rémy Jantin","original_name":"Rémy Jantin","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6877b39edb9b39cf6f1660de","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5568193,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michèle Pédezert","original_name":"Michèle Pédezert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6877b3be2702b9f560cce6d4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3006482,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clément Rière","original_name":"Clément Rière","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6877b3ea286cb2fc8d165c9b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1557448,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pierre Bompy","original_name":"Pierre Bompy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6877b3fc73b4803f1a1ccfcd","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4605300,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ivan Broussegoutte","original_name":"Ivan Broussegoutte","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6877b4130e758257591ccff5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2099651,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olivier Vieillefond","original_name":"Olivier Vieillefond","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6877b422286cb2fc8d165ca2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3744730,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lucie Bruneteau","original_name":"Lucie Bruneteau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6877b434286cb2fc8d165ca9","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1191,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xszxnIFKR7LMZRUsMafDNzbbd7W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":850}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
