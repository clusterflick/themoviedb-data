In a few horrific days, more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslim boys and men were taken to places of detention, abused, tortured and then executed. As their bodies fell into mass graves, the machinery of denial of those crimes was set into motion.  The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia-commonly referred to as the ICTY, investigated, prosecuted and passed judgement on those crimes.  This film tells that story.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/84UoM2VJJiGQGo1NAkgMkmqwdLg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":268172,"logo_path":null,"name":"International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2017-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Srebrenica Genocide: No Room for Denial","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5568161,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Steve Coulson","original_name":"Steve Coulson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6877aed081d9a8230ecf1697","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5568161,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Steve Coulson","original_name":"Steve Coulson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6877aedbc2c7e538301660e7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5568161,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Steve Coulson","original_name":"Steve Coulson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6877aee84398ce7e5b6ab2da","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5568162,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Petar Finci","original_name":"Petar Finci","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6877aef1262ed4ec4c052556","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5568163,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Misel Djuricic","original_name":"Misel Djuricic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6877aefc69ae7a8ec9cf16cc","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt19767646","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/84UoM2VJJiGQGo1NAkgMkmqwdLg.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1327,"name":"war crimes"},{"id":7973,"name":"bosnian war (1992-95)"},{"id":294205,"name":"war documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-12-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
