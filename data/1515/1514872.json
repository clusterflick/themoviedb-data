The past beckons Madison back to her place of origin to face a fragmented part of herself that has been left behind when she is pressured into returning to pastoral Southern Ohio for her motherâ€™s birthday. Young confronts painful memories of the past and awkward conversations with her conservative family as she is confronted about her work in erotic films and her queer identity. She navigates these emotional landmines with the help of her partner, James, whom Young is in a BDSM relationship with, while coming face to face with a part of her childhood that she left behind.","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":129082,"logo_path":null,"name":"Capsaicinco","origin_country":""},{"id":243941,"logo_path":null,"name":"Boycott
