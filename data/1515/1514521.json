Analyzed at Oxford University, this discovery challenges traditional views of church history by revealing the rich musical practices of early believers. Hosted by Australian historian John Dickson, the feature-length documentary “The First Hymn” chronicles the hymn’s journey from its desert origins to its modern resurrection, as acclaimed composers Chris Tomlin and Ben Fielding transform the ancient melody into a contemporary worship piece, culminating in a live concert performance.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/cvmG1O5CajyJc3mjD79t4b2sHrw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":268240,"logo_path":null,"name":"Undeceptions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2025-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"The First Hymn","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2073276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Dickson","original_name":"John Dickson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6878421083a0c6f7bc3db449","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3781124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Tomlin","original_name":"Chris Tomlin","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68784233f41b379234062359","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5569182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Fielding","original_name":"Ben Fielding","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"687842459effd36cc6bbdf98","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5569183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephanie Boonstra","original_name":"Stephanie Boonstra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6878425cbebc800a50bbdf80","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2073276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Dickson","original_name":"John Dickson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687842d75fe56880010623da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2073284,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Hadley","original_name":"Mark Hadley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687842eec3836160cf04e86e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2073284,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Hadley","original_name":"Mark Hadley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6878441477af8586edbbdfeb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2073286,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maia Hadley","original_name":"Maia Hadley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68784426f5385ecdf40622dc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2073284,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Hadley","original_name":"Mark Hadley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687845ec6f687c0913af0b8a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36458791","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1022,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q6AfAnXozsfrEnYPc3M1ReTlEJo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1816}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cvmG1O5CajyJc3mjD79t4b2sHrw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1944}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The First Hymn Movie with Chris Tomlin and Ben Fielding","key":"p2KqdqhgebU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-03-21T02:21:41.000Z","id":"68784488e9d7d3ef41203c67"}]}}}
