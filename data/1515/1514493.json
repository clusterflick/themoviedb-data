From a childhood marked by a haunting Ladybird skeleton to the gouache-drenched goth era of Evil Dead and Nightmare on Elm Street, Graham reflects on a career that has defined horror for generations. Featuring discussions with Reece Shearsmith, Andy Nyman, Madeline Smith, Alan Jones, and more, the film charts a vivid time line through banned video sleeves, goth clubs, iconic posters, and the rediscovery of a lost original.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/uwRxdmWvu1papyxlQ0au7TZl3NM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Captured Souls: In Conversation with Graham Humphreys","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1522278,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Collier","original_name":"Chris Collier","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/uiDio2wT23sd9dRfQgle0pdhVJk.jpg","credit_id":"68782e6d673eefc708ba835f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1522278,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Collier","original_name":"Chris Collier","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/uiDio2wT23sd9dRfQgle0pdhVJk.jpg","credit_id":"68782e7db07d321f0dba838c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1522278,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Collier","original_name":"Chris Collier","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/uiDio2wT23sd9dRfQgle0pdhVJk.jpg","credit_id":"68782e90739e6790a2ba8355","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1522336,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Craig Ennis","original_name":"Craig Ennis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68782ea6e40d04ae5f0c2eb6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30970982","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1701,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uwRxdmWvu1papyxlQ0au7TZl3NM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1149}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
