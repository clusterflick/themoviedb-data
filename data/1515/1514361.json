It was established as a Methodist mission in 1935 and over the years Yolngu from many different clans moved there.  Conversations With Dundiwuy Wanambi is a personal film which reveals something of the struggles and thoughts of one elder in the face of enormous change. In the early years Dundiwuy was a heavy drinker. In a disturbing interview in a pub, Dundiwuy explains his reasons for drinking. Then, through a dream, Dundiwuy realizes he must begin to protect his family and clan. He establishes his Marrakulu clan homeland center at Gurka'wuy, south of Yirrkala. He will hold a great ceremony there. Years later Dundiwuy returns to Yirrkala. His clan is small and he did not receive the necessary support from his sons. But Dundiwuy endures, continues his struggle, and we learn in the post-script of how he has become a successful and sought-after artist.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/lUTPzNk2ZmsASkpzTpRmPs1TOX2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yirrkala: Conversations with Dundiwuy Wanambi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1418735,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Dunlop","original_name":"Ian Dunlop","popularity":0.0773,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6877ddf0679624057443d612","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5109028,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pip Deveson","original_name":"Pip Deveson","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6877de08a456c1adb30526ff","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1675347,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Oliver","original_name":"Chris Oliver","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6877de420a9ee950a205253f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":1053,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lUTPzNk2ZmsASkpzTpRmPs1TOX2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1284,"name":"identity"},{"id":6015,"name":"mining"},{"id":11933,"name":"conflict"},{"id":33577,"name":"environment"},{"id":158217,"name":"colonialism"},{"id":161662,"name":"urban development"},{"id":193459,"name":"australian aboriginal"},{"id":227593,"name":"ethnographic film"},{"id":272583,"name":"visual anthropology"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
