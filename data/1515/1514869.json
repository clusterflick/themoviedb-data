Newsreel’s film documents the street protests and picket lines that animated the strike, foregrounds the voices of striking workers who emphasize the racism and sexism that defined life on the job, and juxtaposes striking labor with corrupt management through montage. Short and agitational, it exemplifies how early Newsreel’s political commitments extended to the contemporary labor movement and its intersections with struggles against racism and sexism.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/tzg9n9EsP0sFpVtiVDR4TnMD8po.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"PA Bell Go to Hell","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tzg9n9EsP0sFpVtiVDR4TnMD8po.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
