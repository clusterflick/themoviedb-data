It has high ground to the east and west and low ground to the south. At its mouth it measures about a quarter of a mile from one side to the other. From the mouth to the beach, at the southernmost point, it measures half of a mile. The distance between the high and low tide mark on the beach is about 100 yards during spring tide. The tripod was placed at an angle of 60 degrees to the horizontal plane midway between the two sides of the bay and at the waters edge. The camera panned through 360 degrees stopping every 45 degrees to take a predetermined number of frames. The shooting speed was one frame per second.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/wyGjFNOwcmm5ighw4cTY2dZrhmX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fforest Bay","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1290502,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Welsby","original_name":"Chris Welsby","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/wVOcPAagP2yxdikKf33OaQs5Lmf.jpg","credit_id":"68795ec9f41b37923406276b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wyGjFNOwcmm5ighw4cTY2dZrhmX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
