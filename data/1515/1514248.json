Much like Fricke's Samsara, the narrative delves into the ebb and flow of nature, observing the beauty of the natural world with the consequences of human actions. The film invites viewers to reflect on our place within these cycles, highlighting moments of harmony and disarray as communities adapt to the changing tides of existence. Through this lens, the work raises crucial questions about sustainability, identity, and the future of youth culture in a rapidly evolving world, ultimately urging a contemplative dialogue on our shared responsibilities towards both the environment and one another.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/mRuxN4OaV9tEcFeEj5tjvde9BV0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":237153,"logo_path":null,"name":"val.4","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Samsara","title":"Silencio (Proof of Concept)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3683495,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomoya Kawamura","original_name":"Tomoya Kawamura","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Raka 0014","credit_id":"6877b97bc2f33ce5b1052587","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3566072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alessandro Riccio","original_name":"Alessandro Riccio","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"God 1","credit_id":"6877b9963ae7a892ae6ab410","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1767500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Sillars","original_name":"David Sillars","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/oQ5Hcb8JPFww3HVqElVrRKaHoPG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The voice","credit_id":"6877b9ad286cb2fc8d165cc6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4901936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brogan Vandenio","original_name":"Brogan Vandenio","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/yUrW3T8CLFpx4BHuYjMG0GZP9Jj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Ego","credit_id":"6877b9bf16857d38d61cd01c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3071516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Refik Anadol","original_name":"Refik Anadol","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/vul2FjLVtZsv77RhBrwtMfCc0H6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Artist","credit_id":"6877baced80d749354052505","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4901936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brogan Vandenio","original_name":"Brogan Vandenio","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/yUrW3T8CLFpx4BHuYjMG0GZP9Jj.jpg","credit_id":"6877baee81bf3d10d20524f0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4901936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brogan Vandenio","original_name":"Brogan Vandenio","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/yUrW3T8CLFpx4BHuYjMG0GZP9Jj.jpg","credit_id":"6877bb0085febea71e6ab81f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4901936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brogan Vandenio","original_name":"Brogan Vandenio","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/yUrW3T8CLFpx4BHuYjMG0GZP9Jj.jpg","credit_id":"6877bb0f4ed217bde3ba1ae8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4901936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brogan Vandenio","original_name":"Brogan Vandenio","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/yUrW3T8CLFpx4BHuYjMG0GZP9Jj.jpg","credit_id":"6877bb20b125a3989ecce340","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37594262","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rcCVHgCQDZcnXbrktAZGRNN7KyU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mRuxN4OaV9tEcFeEj5tjvde9BV0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Silencio Trailer (Directors cut)","key":"518170890","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-03-01T15:16:58.000Z","id":"6877bbd62cff5c22031660f3"}]}}}
