In Ultimate Frisbee, however, there are no referees; even in heated situations, players must resolve their conflicts themselves. The documentary ULTI*MATE - The Spirit of the Game follows the German Mixed National Team on their journey to the European Championships. These idealistic athletes are determined to show that with goodwill, clear communication, and empathy, a peaceful and fair competition is possible. But at the European Championships, their ideals are tested in ways they never expected. Floating through ideals and crashing hard into reality. ULTI*MATE is not only a sports documentary. It’s a story that explores the definition of success and the pressing questions of our time. How can we find constructive solutions, preserve justice, and maintain cohesion when the rules are interpretated diffenrently and our own perceptions are challenged?","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/jHQxDH3zKnmqxsV9d0asFamcODR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130837,"logo_path":"/8ey2nQ60uOXxnVCsbW3X80NjSQ7.png","name":"AV Medien Film +
