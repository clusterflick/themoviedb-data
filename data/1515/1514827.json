As the night spirals from petty frustrations to deeper wounds; fueled by family conflict, cultural estrangement, and casual racism; Kenny clashes bitterly with his father before facing a humiliating encounter with a group of drunken bigots. When Wong overhears their hateful accusations, he snaps, erupting in a violent confrontation that leaves him bloodied but unbowed. In the stunned silence that follows, father and son must quietly navigate the cost of pride, silence, and survival.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":239378,"logo_path":"/oD5LhDL01zQeIPR2eUJnFe6mSGB.png","name":"Iconoclast","origin_country":"US"},{"id":85136,"logo_path":"/gkOBQC95ZhfwC1KKokZbLYh1wPV.png","name":"Agile Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":7281,"logo_path":"/iI7qdR1OFPo0U41BlpKBLD3xesh.png","name":"BFI","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"In 1989, a Chinese takeaway becomes a battleground for pride and identity as a father and his mixed-race son clash under the weight of grief, generational divide, and the quiet violence of everyday racism.","title":"Chinaman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1333452,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Orion Lee","original_name":"Orion Lee","popularity":0.2308,"profile_path":"/jHz7papyoOAFvMql64cXQVQqKYu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Wong","credit_id":"687928fd911acb301eba8678","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5570639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles M Baker","original_name":"Charles M Baker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Kenny","credit_id":"68792d07f65f258406af0e86","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1785617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Caulfield","original_name":"Peter Caulfield","popularity":0.1179,"profile_path":"/wxU6HE4U7AUCn4Qyc7C4blrtf1h.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Kev","credit_id":"68792954faff59031504ec0d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5570641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Aistrup","original_name":"Matthew Aistrup","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Tommy","credit_id":"68792d3171c5e7a449203fe1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5064831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonny Vernon","original_name":"Jonny Vernon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"John","credit_id":"68792d5a7faad4767a20401f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5570640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Remington Summers","original_name":"Remington Summers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Andy","credit_id":"68792d17263111052f0c31e0","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171310,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Chiu","original_name":"Rob Chiu","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6879297c1743b57ba35fae03","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2210431,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lara Perrotte","original_name":"Lara Perrotte","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6879298c096d25b3e45fae2d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5570629,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tom Birmingham","original_name":"Tom Birmingham","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6879299caf860d30a8ba8690","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171310,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Chiu","original_name":"Rob Chiu","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687929a5bd2435c6b7203f5f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5570647,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sarah Pearson","original_name":"Sarah Pearson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68792da1096d25b3e45fae4b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1524377,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sam Ritzenberg","original_name":"Sam Ritzenberg","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68792dcdcdd02efddf5fae69","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33089689","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
