It also reflects how the world at that time perceived and imagined Taiwan. This film is the earliest known surviving motion picture shot in and about Taiwan. This introductory documentary was donated as a duplicate print by the Netherlands Filmmuseum (now Eye Filmmuseum) in 1991. According to the museum’s records, the nitrate print dates to approximately 1922. However, based on the research of scholar Lee Daw-ming, the film may have been shot as early as 1917. The exact date when the original positive film was produced and its subsequent whereabouts remain unknown. Formosa is preserved by the Taiwan Film & Audiovisual Institute in 2025.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/okZG8X7sCIUAB4cX6wubkCY5iyE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1922-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Formosa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/okZG8X7sCIUAB4cX6wubkCY5iyE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1922-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
