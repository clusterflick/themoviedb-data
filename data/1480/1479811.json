But as soon as they understand each other, they quarrel.  Capito?, sometimes known as La Fille de Paname et le gars de Padua, invents a love dialogue from Italian to French between two young people who meet in Rome. Built around speech and how it can be a source of connivance or misunderstanding, it tells the story of the difficulties in understanding the other. By finding Françoise Vatel in front of her camera, Luc Moullet films the nascent affection and probes this singular moment where differences end up bringing us together before gradually separating us.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1962-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Capito?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4557347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Françoise Vatel","original_name":"Françoise Vatel","popularity":0.1613,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"682203c00834f8f64c2d1975","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2656931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alessandro Ninchi","original_name":"Alessandro Ninchi","popularity":0.0558,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"682203c9e5b34d36067e7c8a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236634,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luc Moullet","original_name":"Luc Moullet","popularity":0.4947,"profile_path":"/zzZ3ACtgddW0r14ftmydsFq9VE7.jpg","credit_id":"682203a5e1c07d68892d1a9e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1962-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
