And when they do, worlds often collide. The documentary shares silent struggles, but also moments of solidarity. The film takes an in-depth look at the challenges, but also the hopes and successes of queer people in rural areas. It shows how social change and greater acceptance can develop in smaller towns. The province is more than just the antithesis of the big city - it can be a place of change in which queer people find their own ways to assert their place.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/3YCKjkeavdPfXbSaIegLjqMMwKn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":588,"logo_path":"/6mWg9rdVSj8gwgMiOmZH4iBCcMm.png","name":"MDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"\"Of course I could run away to the big city, like many others do, but I want to make a difference\"","title":"Queer in der Provinz","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5431213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Stehr","original_name":"Eric Stehr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Eric Stehr (self)","credit_id":"682092702eccb846de863cad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5431244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Arnold Krüger","original_name":"Christian Arnold Krüger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Christian Arnold Krüger (self)","credit_id":"68209ae764e941df734b40a8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5431245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jens","original_name":"Jens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Jens (self)","credit_id":"68209b1a73b35a07107e77f4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5431246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe","original_name":"Joe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Joe (self)","credit_id":"68209b296abc6c46f0c85077","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5431215,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolin Hillner","original_name":"Carolin Hillner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682092df29582e1112a15dfc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5431216,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sven Brüher","original_name":"Sven Brüher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6820933153f6015367ad8e37","department":"Crew","job":"Production Controller"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5431217,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anja Weber","original_name":"Anja Weber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6820935632ecbbefea5a2679","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5431218,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Petra Wiegers","original_name":"Petra Wiegers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6820936a8a66bfded07e774f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5431215,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolin Hillner","original_name":"Carolin Hillner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6820954caeac0742467e7762","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2566547,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Thomas Keffel","original_name":"Thomas Keffel","popularity":0.0515,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68209a2f557c3249ef863ceb","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5431237,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Malte Niessen","original_name":"Malte Niessen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68209a449f406d126ec8501f","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5431238,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Maik Krahl","original_name":"Maik Krahl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68209a5cafc9664d855a2603","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/pxE96iTPpCbLmaFbI2KvFTj3cWE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3YCKjkeavdPfXbSaIegLjqMMwKn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Queer in der Provinz | Trailer | MDR","key":"Xadhh9zjXQQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-04-30T11:01:03.000Z","id":"68209523a3c0c9df96a15da0"}]}}}
