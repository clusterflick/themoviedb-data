Things quickly take a turn for the worst when a group of rioters storm the building, hunting down answers about a beloved senior quantum physicist who's missing. Furthermore, an experiment being conducted within Rue's sector malfunctions resulting in the laboratory glitching into different timelines. Rue and her crush and security guard, Iris Lavigne (Isabelle Gascon) now must escape alive. Sapphic is a story about how nothing good comes from violence and the personal realization from Rue Monroe that sometimes you need to take that leap of faith, to confess to your crush, because if not you might miss your chance to do so.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/saNWdecRIb4TN2ueGemhn8vDd05.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sapphic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36721001","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
