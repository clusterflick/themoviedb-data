Employing cyanotype and eco-coloring techniques, the piece captures fleeting impressions and refractions, where illumination emerges only to be swallowed again by darkness. As much about erasure as it is about presence, Inundation meditates on the impermanence of lightâ€”its ability to imprint, dissolve, and transform the cinematic surface into a shifting, alchemical space.  This piece was made in collaboration with Alberto Sanchez.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/w1IUlTVFZANsGHI640QB4qEBGVC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inundation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5433893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominick Rivers","original_name":"Dominick Rivers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682231b96e5bb4e1304b4565","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w1IUlTVFZANsGHI640QB4qEBGVC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
