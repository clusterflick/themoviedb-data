Hwang Wook, the director of the hysterical, award-winning neo-Western black comedy MASH VILLE, an acclaimed World Premiere at last year’s Fantasia, returns to the festival with a new film in a completely different genre. THE WOMAN is a riveting, character-driven psychological thriller, filled with non-stop tension and suspense, thanks to its eerie musical score and stunning cinematography, and boasting an outstanding lead performance by Han Hye-ji. THE WOMAN is yet another excellent slice of independent Korean filmmaking, by a director who needs to be on your radar.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"INDIE KOREAN THRILLER THE WOMAN TRADES IN TENSION AND SUSPENSE","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":232824,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ahn Ji-hye","original_name":"Ahn Ji-hye","popularity":0.4151,"profile_path":"/wwLTyaZDd7gbHZ3bRVDIcPgQRAa.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"682133ee7daf349b974b4320","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2204085,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"HWANG Dong-wook","original_name":"HWANG Dong-wook","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682133c3f7f2a26bb8c853ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
