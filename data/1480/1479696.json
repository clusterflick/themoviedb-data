The song’s title metaphorically declares that just like the wind cannot be stopped by traffic signals, a warrior’s courage knows no limits.  With powerful vocals, stirring lyrics, and an energetic composition, the song paints the life of a soldier as an epic saga of heroism—where the sky becomes their path, the earth their camp, and their uniform’s stars narrate untold tales of freedom. From the freezing Himalayas to the scorching deserts, the lyrics honor their unyielding vigilance, comparing them to eagles in the sky, tigers in battle, and volcanoes of unshakable resolve.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kaatrukku Traffic Signal illai","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
