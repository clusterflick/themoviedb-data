Blending feminist philosophy and cinematic theory, the film challenges the normative gaze by collapsing boundaries between subject and object. Intimate and tactile, the camera becomes an extension of their relationshipâ€”capturing moments of love, play, dress-up, and reflection. In the spirit of Barbara Hammer, the film is a queer declaration of love made through sunlight, plastic textures, and whispered voiceovers. As the two film and reflect each other, they create a shared space of transformation, where everyday rituals become sites of spontaneous queer co-becoming.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Luminous Matter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
