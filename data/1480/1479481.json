Now, heâ€™s exploring darker edges of his sensibilities with TERRESTRIAL, a provocative thriller with unconventional comedy and sci-fi elements, still rooted in character and behavior, but filtered through paranoia and fear. A reunion weekend spirals out of control for four college friends when the host (Jermaine Fowler, SORRY TO BOTHER YOU) a science fiction writer on the verge of newfound success, fights to maintain his sense of reality in the face of sudden, uncanny dangers. Fowler is brilliant here and is flanked by a cast that includes James Morosini (I LOVE MY DAD), Pauline Chalamet (SEX LIFE OF COLLEGE GIRLS), Edy Modica (JURY DUTY), with Rob Yang (SUCCESSION) and Brendan Hunt (TED LASSO).","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"TERRESTRIAL","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2023667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Morosini","original_name":"James Morosini","popularity":0.6845,"profile_path":"/vaBLK53OiwM0E4S4IHkbvSaOKHR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68212b21eb8d52f9b4863ff3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2458820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pauline Chalamet","original_name":"Pauline Chalamet","popularity":0.6236,"profile_path":"/mVbbrdZJEccGsSWCQtoDXsxi3Ek.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68212b31c9d49e83bca160e1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2657735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edy Modica","original_name":"Edy Modica","popularity":0.5863,"profile_path":"/rN7hwvl89pw20ojiT8QjmOM3KBU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68212b4c00df2bd2f4a15fe4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":207389,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rob Yang","original_name":"Rob Yang","popularity":1.8008,"profile_path":"/fKNbgGoJguxiXeaQbVEHNwSYZQg.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"68212b5c224cbe8d27863f20","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1113365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brendan Hunt","original_name":"Brendan Hunt","popularity":1.1684,"profile_path":"/3P8YeRaNSB3XMcujL23qzDhJa5s.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"68212b710c348839c2739155","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
