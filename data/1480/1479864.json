The entire video was shot on location in Hawaii, and the live action and CG are skillfully combined. In the morning, she wakes up in her hotel bed in just a shirt, puts on makeup and heads outside. She cycles along the coastline, sunbathes on Waikiki Beach, and goes to a restaurant in the afternoon. This video follows the golden pattern of an idol image video, and is a delight for fans. The second half of the film also includes behind-the-scenes footage, which shows the staff's enthusiasm for the CG idol \"Terayuki,\" as well as where and how the film was shot on location in Hawaii and how the film was produced.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yuki Terai in Virtual Hawaii","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2001-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
