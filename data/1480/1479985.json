Each of the videos in the series explores the spaces and characteristics of a different floor of the building (“On the Second Floor,” “On the Third Floor,” “On the Fourth Floor,” “On the Fifth Floor,” and “Fade Out in Color”).  The second floor of the building features several old/forlorn/discarded chairs that are scattered in the liminal spaces. I have never seen anyone sitting in those chairs. (Who would want to?) And considering the depressing atmosphere of the building, it doesn’t surprise me that the public water fountain doesn’t work.  I suppose that this video can be summed up as a comparison between the “haves” and the “have nots.” Into which category do you fit? If you are a “have not,” sit down in one of these chairs and relax. You are not alone.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/t1mTvBZiRg5kvZShF3yrCU3euff.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Second Floor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1977808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Neil Ira Needleman","original_name":"Neil Ira Needleman","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6822392b752abbbbf85a2d06","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t1mTvBZiRg5kvZShF3yrCU3euff.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
