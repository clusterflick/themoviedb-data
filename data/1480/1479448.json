The film follows the journey of Jack and Keegan, two childhood friends, united by their love of open water swimming.  Others will never understand why they love the ocean, but they always have and always will.  â€‹With Jack's departure for university drawing near, the pair decide to push their limits with an ambitious swim along a harsh stretch of coastline.  As they train, the rhythm of their friendship is tested. Jack approaches the swim with caution. Keegan, driven by a deep need to prove himself, pushes forward despite the dangers.  As the deep, blue water surges on the day of the swim, their differences collide. Through the crashing waves and cries of seabirds, Mordros shows a deeply human story of friendship. We want to tell a story of swimming through rough waters, the beauty of growing up, and the courage it takes to dive into the unknown.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/l5OQdIYAySme87W1qV9oLfWOm3w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":244019,"logo_path":null,"name":"Breathing films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Two best friends and open-water swimmers take on one final challenge.","title":"Mordros","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5432010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Collinson","original_name":"Andrew Collinson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Jack","credit_id":"6821121bafc9664d855a2834","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4703990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Munro","original_name":"Sean Munro","popularity":0.1052,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Keegan","credit_id":"6821123111d6d7ec9d2d1706","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5043930,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuli Freed","original_name":"Yuli Freed","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/1BMjNND0dc2ddP8ln4hMMlmbYtX.jpg","credit_id":"6821125ad99cb470bc738dc7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5043926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noah Berridge","original_name":"Noah Berridge","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682112691ec97632f0c85358","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5043930,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuli Freed","original_name":"Yuli Freed","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/1BMjNND0dc2ddP8ln4hMMlmbYtX.jpg","credit_id":"6821127e3eeec88274ad910f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5432011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Inez White","original_name":"Inez White","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6821129790599652aead90fd","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5432012,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kaitlyn Jarrett-Barnes","original_name":"Kaitlyn Jarrett-Barnes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682112b31ec97632f0c85362","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5432013,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jamie Brown","original_name":"Jamie Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682112cfe8ab2ec38b4b4209","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5043926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noah Berridge","original_name":"Noah Berridge","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682112f12a7f8c956ac851bf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5043930,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuli Freed","original_name":"Yuli Freed","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/1BMjNND0dc2ddP8ln4hMMlmbYtX.jpg","credit_id":"68211304911c5060a9c852bb","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5043926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noah Berridge","original_name":"Noah Berridge","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68219c27d130b2fc6d5a2a6b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36581423","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1617,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zTdKcjFx4hacZnRQBeWLWulNhWz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2875}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l5OQdIYAySme87W1qV9oLfWOm3w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6054,"name":"friendship"},{"id":10683,"name":"coming of age"},{"id":11827,"name":"swimmer"},{"id":34079,"name":"death"},{"id":316421,"name":"drama"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Mordros (2025) | Official Trailer 4K","key":"zbZiHb0o7rQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-04-28T13:55:28.000Z","id":"682113cf53f6015367ad9056"}]}}}
