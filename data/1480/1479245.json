While the first group dedicates itself to decorating its street in green and yellow, adorning it with banners and setting up a large screen to welcome thousands of fans, the other has an important political role on the streets, questioning the process of elitizing football, the high ticket prices and the billions spent on stadium renovations.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/9aNPpHkUVfXbtwBo2sZMOIScZ5p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78865,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nofoco Filmes Produções
