In this lost country backwater of mountains and vegetable fields, factories still manufacture soy sauce in century old clay pots; Kenny hand makes concrete spacers that hold up some of the world’s longest suspension bridges. Cha Guo 茶粿 shines light on the lives of the villagers, craftsmen, farmers and business owners who make up this local village’s close-knit community. The people’s philosophy and signature are their resilience and their dedication. They embody “Made in Hong Kong” over generations. Cha Guo 茶粿 celebrates the heroes of Hong Kong and the fabric of what makes it and its people synonymous with warmth and the ubiquitous “can do” attitude.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/3ldBrblOiVrYgiZrMI2Qp8jSbp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2025-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cha Guo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5432387,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daphné Mandel","original_name":"Daphné Mandel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682156f30c348839c27391e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5432388,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guy Bertrand","original_name":"Guy Bertrand","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68215702badcd951ef4b4292","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2779,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/3ldBrblOiVrYgiZrMI2Qp8jSbp.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1853}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"I","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"CHA GUO 茶粿 Film Trailer","key":"2Fgtf4AQo0M","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-11-12T13:31:54.000Z","id":"682158eb343fb57fd7ad9192"}]}}}
