A voice (Todd Terry) from the truck towing it tells her they must reach a mysterious doctor within the hour or she’ll suffer a horrific fate. Thus begins HELLCAT, the feature debut of writer/editor/director Brock Bodell, who previously cut the mind-bending ULTRASOUND (Fantasia 2021), among others. Bodell doesn’t take a wrong turn, delivering a twisty thrill ride of strong characters, shredding tension, and real surprises that takes viewers deep into unexpected places. Featuring SNL’s James Austin Johnson as the voice of a late-night DJ on a supernatural call-in show, and gripping performances from supporting cast Jordan Mullins and Liz Atwater","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"HELLCAT","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1878065,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dakota Gorman","original_name":"Dakota Gorman","popularity":0.8581,"profile_path":"/4Hi6pNCVz4ZUYVL6hSsA9ouZMWf.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"682135652186d5ae7ead910e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Todd Terry","original_name":"Todd Terry","popularity":0.9266,"profile_path":"/vB9zZNg8qZPlSijYs84F4LpwVpo.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68213575aa0a2c16244b434f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1756597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Austin Johnson","original_name":"James Austin Johnson","popularity":1.2245,"profile_path":"/g9y0aABiKtB1FOIKmklDlgRpDof.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"682135c45aaa25641aad90db","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4699265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jordan Mullins","original_name":"Jordan Mullins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"682135e465d0c8f3be2d198a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4561307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liz Atwater","original_name":"Liz Atwater","popularity":0.1513,"profile_path":"/7snM7CLyKgTCKz4I3jFxWFtrT8c.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"682135f3ddf6d9999cad9058","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2416846,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brock Bodell","original_name":"Brock Bodell","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6821359c219b8e9a7b738fb8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
