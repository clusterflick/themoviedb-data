One late night on the town she meets a cute, young guy and an innocent flirtation ensues. It becomes less innocent when the cute guy suddenly shows up at the gymnasium as she new music teacher.  The girl from the blockbuster SMUK is a new main character, but it is still a story about love, friendship, sexual liberation and high school culture. Like SMUKKERE, however, most importantly a film about boundaries â€“ about limitlessness, about knowing your boundaries, meeting them and transcending them.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Smukkere","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
