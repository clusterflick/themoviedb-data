By the end of the festival some hangovers are being nursed, mostly spirits remain undimmed. English singer Elvis Costello drops the on-stage bomb that artists haven't been paid, Chris Knox notes the \"money fiasco\" his own way, and the festivalgoers rate how the weekend went.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/yekbpozsxOE64fjlYAVFnDIl0UU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148850,"logo_path":null,"name":"Point of View
