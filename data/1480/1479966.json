He is deeply connected to the '90s performance scene. Set in Budapest's alternative art world, the story explores Adam's struggles as his mother battles cancer. The mood of the film echoes the 1990s Hungarian film No Girl Ever Had This Effect on Me. It captures a similar raw, alternative atmosphere, blending Budapest's underground art scene with personal struggles, existential uncertainty, and a melancholic yet deeply human perspective.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Are Nice, But I Don't Understand Women","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
