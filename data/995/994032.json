CsA always places at least one camera in the field of reality that constantly records the making process as it is taking place. This means that from the very moment in which production is inaugurated with the question ‘If you could make a film, what film would you do? all the assemblies, screenings, scene preparations, script discussions and so forth are registered and are available to be included in the film—if the nosotros so decides. What is presented in Nos llaman las estereras is an exemplification of something that is very common to CsA’s process of production: the scene is not only recorded as a scene, but as a life event.
