With an eager young Arthur by his side, Merlin has taken on the guise of teacher, advisor and father figure to the young King but history paints the mysterious sorcerer in much murkier colours. Ironically, there is more evidence to support the existence of Merlin than there is for Arthur, but the evidence points to a holy man from demonic parentage or a wild man of the woods rather than a kindly old magician.  Using new evidence, historical text and expert analysis this video attempts to separate myth from reality and identify the true origins and life of the most famous of wizards.","popularity":0.0602,"poster_path":"/9A3iIbLBRA8i8MkcWMoF7x2ODcE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Arthurian Legends: Merlin","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3607179,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Whelan","original_name":"Bob Whelan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"62be164b22e4800059a83c0d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3606563,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Susanna Shadrake","original_name":"Susanna Shadrake","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62be16333009aa00d20bd1b5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229579,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bob Carruthers","original_name":"Bob Carruthers","popularity":0.1612,"profile_path":"/vWqpErkseOgbYYiKoc0VvmEvHDX.jpg","credit_id":"62be16703009aa00d025d856","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2956909,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gary Russell","original_name":"Gary Russell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62be1680105611004ea023b6","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2888749,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gavin Bott","original_name":"Gavin Bott","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62be168be942be00807aa790","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2888750,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Audrey Healey","original_name":"Audrey Healey","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62be169d325a5100c25d7572","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2076852,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"James Fowler","original_name":"James Fowler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62be16ac2ac499004c176fc5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1562439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Gormlie","original_name":"Chris Gormlie","popularity":0.044,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62be16c1325a5100c3a3927b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2BQB445yxmObOstaslbor66sNUL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1992,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9A3iIbLBRA8i8MkcWMoF7x2ODcE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1328}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Copyright stamp","release_date":"2001-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
