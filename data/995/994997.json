It is about remembrance, a subject it treats through the chronicling of events and the development of a idiosyncratic way of seeing. The audience is given the sense of viewing these places through the filter of time and the properties of a particular mind's eye. Original scenes are used much as an Impressionist uses a landscape: visual elements are emphasized using film techniques such as animation and optical printing, and the slow rhythms and random nature of recall are evoked through sound and structure.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fla.Me.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3609396,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ted Lyman","original_name":"Ted Lyman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c0b1cb957e6d007c2581ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
