Sirens is an experimental short documentary that captures Germany’s coal-fired power plants in their final years of generating energy. Shot entirely from helicopters, the film takes us on a journey through industrial wastelands, thus recalling the passage of Ulysses’ boat through the Sirens’ strait. An odyssey through the dystopian industrial world that has left a permanent mark on earth’s ecosphere.","popularity":0.0482,"poster_path":"/goSFok4oHCNBRmBf5nEfz6i7Cts.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82316,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kristof Gerega - Schuldenberg Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2022-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sirens","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2512141,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sofia Angelina Machado","original_name":"Sofia Angelina Machado","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c03f1363d713026c2ece9c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2512139,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Demetrio Castellucci","original_name":"Demetrio Castellucci","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c03f2a22e4800fa5c227ef","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2279073,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilaria Di Carlo","original_name":"Ilaria Di Carlo","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c03e3c532acb0327a84179","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3608929,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ricardo Murga","original_name":"Ricardo Murga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c03f43924ce6004cb21add","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2279073,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilaria Di Carlo","original_name":"Ilaria Di Carlo","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c03e35532acb0327a84174","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3608925,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fabian Altenried","original_name":"Fabian Altenried","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c03ea3532acb0327a841cc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1001693,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristof Gerega","original_name":"Kristof Gerega","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c03eb963d713026db583e7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2223229,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francisco Mece","original_name":"Francisco Mece","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c03efbaf6e9412606c66ea","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3022509,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sophie Ahrens","original_name":"Sophie Ahrens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c03e4f325a5100c1faece0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14253270","wikidata_id":"Q123965252","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"sirens_shortfilm","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1030,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/goSFok4oHCNBRmBf5nEfz6i7Cts.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":728}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Part of \"FEINKOŠT 2022\"","release_date":"2022-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"34.
