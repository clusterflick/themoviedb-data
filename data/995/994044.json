Many friends and citizens gathered at his home in Uji. On the 15th a worker-farmer funeral was held at the Sanjo YMCA. Prokino's Kyoto Branch shot these five days of activities. The long line of cars is filled with taxis, whose drivers deeply admired Yamamoto. The Watanabe in the title refers to the head of the Communist Party of Japan. Watanabe was returning to Japan from Taiwan when he was stopped by authorities. He committed suicide in their custody. Yamamoto and Watanabe were mourned together.","popularity":0.3807,"poster_path":"/b36pHWAXFaCNnDbhMRO9A8bSThj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":177796,"logo_path":"/p1VzPc3bKED3tNVNVtNwlTsdK2Y.png","name":"Prokino","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1929-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yamamoto Senji Watanabe Masanosuke Worker-Farmer Funeral","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3605173,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Genjū Sasa","original_name":"Genjū Sasa","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bdcbbe229ae22291cd629b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3608519,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shin Nakajima","original_name":"Shin Nakajima","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bfae6ff1b571007c9f90a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134276,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Keiji Matsuzaki","original_name":"松崎啓次","popularity":0.1323,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bfaeee105611004ea0d15f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1323605,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Isamu Ueda","original_name":"Isamu Ueda","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bfaf1b28723c007c12883d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3608523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tetsuo Kitagawa","original_name":"Tetsuo Kitagawa","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62bfaf50924ce60059cce2df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b36pHWAXFaCNnDbhMRO9A8bSThj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14548,"name":"political assassination"},{"id":164400,"name":"labor union"},{"id":230660,"name":"funeral ceremony"},{"id":239902,"name":"political documentary"},{"id":299046,"name":"left wing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1929-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
