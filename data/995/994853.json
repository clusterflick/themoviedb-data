I also say: “Playing in this band is so easy”  ....and: “These guys can play anything”.  All these statements are largely true, but it was not always so. It’s been a long and sometimes hard 41 year journey for me. Wishbone Ash - the band of my dreams - has come a long way. As this rockumentary DVD shows ( and my ol’ mum says ) the proof is in the pudding - this DVD. The greater Wishbone Ash family of musicians has had its ups and downs over the years, for sure. Everyone knows that, but good music comes out of dynamic tension - struggle, if you will. Blood, sweat and tears got us to where we are today. The result is the legacy of a great band and its music from all four decades of its existence.
