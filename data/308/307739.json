But the best story on the tape, \"Too Much TV,\" stars Lisa Hatter as a girl who watches a slasher-movie host on cable all day, figuring out ways to kill her sarcastic mother Sonja Etzel, while we watch B-movie parodies like \"Don't Go Into the Kitchen,\" \"Bathroom Bullies,\" \"Pretty Girl Floyd,\" \"Nursing Home Revenge,\" and \"Missouri Mop Massacre.\"","popularity":0.083,"poster_path":"/rId2rSxWFwz7DJgDhGI93d1rqte.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1988-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Satan Place: A Soap Opera from Hell","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2530355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Warren Andrews","original_name":"Warren Andrews","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Edward Dayton / Human Hormoan (segment \"Disposable Love\")","credit_id":"5e3b251c0c2710001a76d92a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2530357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nora Miller","original_name":"Nora Miller","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Doris Dayton (segment \"Disposable Love\")","credit_id":"5e3b252f43250f0019c7d055","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2530358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Rackstraw","original_name":"Mark Rackstraw","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Gordon Lighthand (segment \"Disposable Love\") / Dick Slasher / Thug #2 (segment \"Too Much TV\")","credit_id":"5e3b254591745b00172e6780","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2530359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonja Etzel","original_name":"Sonja Etzel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Midget Woeman (segment \"Disposable Love\") / Mother (segment \"Too Much TV\")","credit_id":"5e3b255aac8e6b001ac9aed2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2530360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert DeFilippo","original_name":"Robert DeFilippo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Paramedic #1 (segment \"Disposable Love\")","credit_id":"5e3b2573ac8e6b001ac9af06","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2530362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry DeFilippo","original_name":"Larry DeFilippo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Paramedic #2 (segment \"Disposable Love\")","credit_id":"5e3b259466e4690016cac62d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2530363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hollis Wood","original_name":"Hollis Wood","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Johnnie (segment \"Say Goodnight, Sophie\")","credit_id":"5e3b25a30c2710001a76d976","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2530327,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jeff Stogner","original_name":"Jeff Stogner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"Old Man (segment \"Say Goodnight, Sophie\")","credit_id":"5e3b25b766e4690014caca47","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2530364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Edwards","original_name":"Joe Edwards","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"Doctor (segment \"Say Goodnight, Sophie\")","credit_id":"5e3b25d598f1f1001409eab4","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2530366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathy Pedersen","original_name":"Kathy Pedersen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":23,"character":"Nurse (segment \"Say Goodnight, Sophie\")","credit_id":"5e3b25e391745b00142e497c","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2530367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Grisafi","original_name":"Nick Grisafi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":24,"character":"Orderly (segment \"Say Goodnight, Sophie\") / Bully #1 / Thug #1 (segment \"Too Much TV\")","credit_id":"5e3b25f343250f0017c67a72","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2530318,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jon Kay","original_name":"Jon Kay","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":25,"character":"Det.
