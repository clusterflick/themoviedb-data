The children, as young as two or three, have room and time to question, wonder, and learn. We build a wading pool, use tools, climb and swing, bath a dog - and learn to live together. There are spats, and little adult interference. A tree house sparks children's imagination. They visit a neighboring farm, play with the animals and ride on a tractor that's plowing. They eat and nap. There's story time, easels for art, and a lollipop. It's the perfect place for city children to be safe from bombardment, says the narrator.","popularity":0.2998,"poster_path":"/b9oySRtIraUJhl55eiU8SnXvmde.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75887,"logo_path":"/1uUQZlr9mVDytTHXPVzHNM7aJT6.png","name":"National Association of Early Childhood Teacher Educators","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Child Went Forth","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lloyd Gough","original_name":"Lloyd Gough","popularity":0.2879,"profile_path":"/hWyEWTVQ0dy8RE9l2fEkOaKTQwX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"571a398a92514149b8000a9a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39009,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Losey","original_name":"Joseph Losey","popularity":0.325,"profile_path":"/sPcG1jKsfCIViiDRJkB0FzH0PJt.jpg","credit_id":"547c117bc3a3685afd002194","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1089217,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Fernhout","original_name":"John Fernhout","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":"/eGhcV5sQKwqPkcO6mxnt4JJ1wNy.jpg","credit_id":"6551065d9653f613f6281f8e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":138168,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Munro Leaf","original_name":"Munro Leaf","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"571a399c92514149b8000a9d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11632,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hanns Eisler","original_name":"Hanns Eisler","popularity":0.0805,"profile_path":"/wtV0rzTPS5npiEN3JeXsb2czTFa.jpg","credit_id":"666bf873338c40e46924a8b4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0033462","wikidata_id":"Q123289233","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b9oySRtIraUJhl55eiU8SnXvmde.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1942-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
