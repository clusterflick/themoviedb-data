When Raju's dad passes away, the local money-lender gives him an ultimatum to either re-pay the loan or he will take possession of his house and land. Raju decides to hitch a ride to Bombay, get a job, save some money, buy a couple of bullocks, till his land and re-pay the money-lender. No one gives him a ride, so he stows away in the back of a fruit-laden truck, which has one more stowaway, a run-away gypsy named Tarna. Both of them meet, fall in love, promise to help and marry each other. After the truck ride, they board a goods train bound for Bombay, but during the journey both get separated. A few months Raju finds out that Tarna is now known as Meenakshi, a movie actress.","popularity":0.3446,"poster_path":"/hRb0yB8z1B5zoSVQbeiGZ1bV609.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mere Humsafar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharmila Tagore","original_name":"Sharmila Tagore","popularity":0.8447,"profile_path":"/m2MFSVdx4aKVoLRFPJoO5u0FMon.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tarna","credit_id":"60c45363c3514c005674f745","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3121457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suresh","original_name":"Suresh","popularity":0.1103,"profile_path":"/tOoLun1BNbNlKXg0iYEclRJoXwi.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Raigiya Dada","credit_id":"60c45386a284eb00583a5627","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":616995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeetendra","original_name":"Jeetendra","popularity":0.3196,"profile_path":"/i1D38TUK4JynQHq0hgihFkD61ba.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Raju","credit_id":"60c453a7a76ac5006d9d9839","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Balraj Sahni","original_name":"Balraj Sahni","popularity":0.1586,"profile_path":"/hMgJ6agJtvsVdA7k6P6JJGl5Dcb.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ashok","credit_id":"60c453c38c3159002818d7c2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1035282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laxmi Chhaya","original_name":"Laxmi Chhaya","popularity":0.1274,"profile_path":"/74k4Ny29RLiuyqBdqrP0q96WaPE.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Kusum","credit_id":"60c453e899259c00596c8f34","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeevan Dhar","original_name":"Jeevan Dhar","popularity":0.1386,"profile_path":"/6Ejb0SzyrmjEpG6962ziowDc29Q.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mittal","credit_id":"60c45431a76ac50040f30272","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2106608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dulal guha","original_name":"Dulal guha","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c454b0aaf89700584a7bc2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0215988","wikidata_id":"Q6818866","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.682,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hRb0yB8z1B5zoSVQbeiGZ1bV609.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":698}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
