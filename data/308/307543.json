A rich bachelor pretending to be poor takes a job with her and competes for her affections with a count and a tenor.  No print of the film is known to survive, and it is therefore a lost film. It is based on the operetta Es lebe die Liebe by Alexander Engel and Wilhelm Sterk. It was one of a cycle of operetta films made during the early sound era. A French-language version, Venetian Nights (Nuits de Venise), also directed by Wiene, was released the same year.
