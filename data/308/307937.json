He saves his hard-earned money with Lakhsmi, and when the time comes for Sundari's marriage & dowry, he goes to take his money, only to be humiliated by Lakhsmi. Sundari's marriage gets canceled, she kills herself, and Bhoop in turn kills Lakhsmi, subsequently takes to a life of crime, amasses a huge fortune, gives birth to a daughter, Nisha, and ends up in jail after double-crossing his partner-in-crime, Vikram Singh. He instructs his wife to bring up Nisha, as a widow. In prison, Bhoop meets with a honest man, Jaswant Singh, who has come to the city to look for his estranged brother. Bhoop asks Jaswant to look after his wife and daughter - not realizing that he may have made another mistake as Jaswant has an alias - that of bandit Dhurjan Singh, and is also the brother of Vikram Singh.","popularity":0.2783,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1986-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kaanch Ki Deewar","video":false,"vote_average":9.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sanjeev Kumar","original_name":"Sanjeev Kumar","popularity":0.2073,"profile_path":"/xfqirwZjtRdzioJ66dUZTBU2KgB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jaswant 'Jassu' Singh / Dhurjan Singh","credit_id":"61d32f62d19a3300679eafac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":585191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Smita Patil","original_name":"Smita Patil","popularity":0.6241,"profile_path":"/olybUaCAWesPS9L4uQhc0lOqbIq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Nisha","credit_id":"61d32f6d4975600067a53fa2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shakti Kapoor","original_name":"Shakti Kapoor","popularity":0.417,"profile_path":"/fhVKy38jwGJyp82ptGPo0Y5Ca3k.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Vikram Singh","credit_id":"61d32f79497560004221853d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1903536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rajan Sippy","original_name":"Rajan Sippy","popularity":0.0919,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Rajesh L.
