He takes the place of the Italian officer Giovanni Retsini and, as captain Giovanni, now helps the residents of the island as much as possible. At the same time, he also falls in love with Anna Roditi, a member of the Resistance. He travels back and forth to the Middle East carrying secret plans for the defense of the Dodecanese. The revelation of Aris' activity also leads to Anna's arrest, who is about to be court-martial-led. The capitulation of Italy, however, averts such an unpleasant development. With the end of the war and the unification of the Dodecanese islands with Greece, Aris returns to Rhodes to live there forever with his beloved Anna Roditi.","popularity":0.1705,"poster_path":"/lQ2hR7VKALZxqf7xYaeDJOCTw3s.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40020,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anzervos","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1948-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anna of Rhodes","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1311214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ketty Panou","original_name":"Καίτη Πάνου","popularity":0.2711,"profile_path":"/dkS5AyMn8wJiKnJcbDhjmKHYbOI.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Anna Roditi","credit_id":"547c9fbdc3a368125a0020cb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1129635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Labros Konstadaras","original_name":"Λάμπρος Κωνσταντάρας","popularity":0.2221,"profile_path":"/l5cLMwyjxnGPQlphtoDFCzdWATK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Aris Galanos","credit_id":"547c9fce9251412d78003166","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1392332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yiannis Prineas","original_name":"Γιάννης Πρινέας","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Panagis Roditis","credit_id":"547c9fea92514123ef0015f1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1392333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lalas Iakovidis","original_name":"Λάζαρος Ιακωβίδης","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":"/gUmLSa70ZEPJjd7Z4mmvwILzDV7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Giovanni Regilli","credit_id":"547ca001c3a3685af000366f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dimos Starenios","original_name":"Δήμος Σταρένιος","popularity":0.2564,"profile_path":"/suH1ohpTgUgL9hOZoo0baTyyTLm.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Pantelis","credit_id":"547ca00c9251411f4e002164","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1392334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicos Matheos","original_name":"Nicos Matheos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Giannis","credit_id":"547ca02c9251412d7f003259","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1392335,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Persa Vlahou","original_name":"Persa Vlahou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Harikleia","credit_id":"547ca03bc3a3685af3002a8a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1392336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aliki Alpha","original_name":"Aliki Alpha","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Aliki","credit_id":"547ca04a9251412d7c003395","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1392337,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stella Arvaniti","original_name":"Stella Arvaniti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"547ca05d9251412d7f003267","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1392338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roi Foka","original_name":"Roi Foka","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"547ca064c3a3685aed0037e8","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1392339,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaiti Lavda","original_name":"Kaiti Lavda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"547ca06bc3a3685aed0037f1","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1392340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"G.
