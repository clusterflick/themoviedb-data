Shortly thereafter, his daughter, Hema, finds his dead body in his bedroom. She phones her brother, Ratan, who arrives, finds a suicide note in his dad's room, clarifying that he had embezzled 20 lakhs from the bank, is unable to repay it, and hence is killing himself. Ratan decides to protect the good name of the family and does not tell anyone about the suicide note to anyone, including Hema. Shortly thereafter, Ratan is approached by a blackmailer named Shekhar, who threatens to expose Ratan's secret if Ratan does not participate in a bank robbery that will take place two days before the final audit. Ratan assists him, the robbery takes place, the money is looted, all bank records are burnt, and the robbers make a successful getaway.","popularity":0.394,"poster_path":"/dXjY77TJBRpY6qURi5w2XCJnKtl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":66641,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chitralaya","origin_country":"IN"},{"id":102703,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chithrakala Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1973-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Deep Trap","title":"Gehri Chaal","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amitabh Bachchan","original_name":"Amitabh Bachchan","popularity":1.2497,"profile_path":"/u69PvpWqGkywSm0YjFiw77j9eqS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ratan","credit_id":"5631227ec3a3681b54010796","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hema Malini","original_name":"Hema Malini","popularity":0.5432,"profile_path":"/dfNRjtvbxisRSBDhCoUMuEFyY3V.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Hema","credit_id":"5631226b9251414ab700e4a0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":616995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeetendra","original_name":"Jeetendra","popularity":0.3196,"profile_path":"/i1D38TUK4JynQHq0hgihFkD61ba.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Sagar","credit_id":"563122609251416d520024e6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Prem Chopra","original_name":"Prem Chopra","popularity":0.421,"profile_path":"/4hLAhScWZA6utfg8VCivwVH6FHy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Madan","credit_id":"563122a6c3a3681b5401079a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":623417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bindu Desai","original_name":"Bindu Desai","popularity":0.3388,"profile_path":"/zD1ZSbQOIcs9k0KdKMsE1iJOpz6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Shobha Shankar","credit_id":"563122949251414ad800e5d9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1030412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chandrashekhar Vaidya","original_name":"Chandrashekhar Vaidya","popularity":0.271,"profile_path":"/zEWqNyfWpOuJnp62cSuTQvQQE1P.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Actor","credit_id":"563123cf925141284c010530","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1036358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"P.
