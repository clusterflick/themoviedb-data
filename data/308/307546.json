Their parents have the same plan, too ... but with regards to their nosy kids.  And so it happens, that Tobby wants to surprise the parents with the announcement of their -- the parents' -- engagement at a party (so nice to let them know), but is one-upped by Stefanie's father, the old Count, who announces the engagement of the kids.  To avoid a scandal, they have to get married, but will divorce later.","popularity":0.253,"poster_path":"/rsWXHYRGiOSFLNsRms6L1095412.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12372,"logo_path":"/lcQScIQXHQXuLMLFQt0loJl5gWJ.png","name":"UFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1933-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cairo Season","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Cairo Season","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":590669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renate Müller","original_name":"Renate Müller","popularity":0.0938,"profile_path":"/4iXS1IMDKOFuHCaCpvzh31JEcAQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Stefanie von Weidling-Weidling","credit_id":"547e4487c3a3685af30057d3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13893,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willy Fritsch","original_name":"Willy Fritsch","popularity":0.1709,"profile_path":"/7MKVQWgy8VncbRxF249WimBxfxm.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tobby Blackwell","credit_id":"547e449e9251411f4e00520f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gustav Waldau","original_name":"Gustav Waldau","popularity":0.1054,"profile_path":"/qNucFeS8EtlbSxsQOoUWgpn06Im.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Leopold Graf von Weidling-Weidling","credit_id":"547e44c5c3a3685af30057da","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leopoldine Konstantin","original_name":"Leopoldine Konstantin","popularity":0.123,"profile_path":"/k4ij3atW67a7mBIWUJefmQ1uSEb.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ellinor Blackwell","credit_id":"547e44e19251412d7800640b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angelo Ferrari","original_name":"Angelo Ferrari","popularity":0.065,"profile_path":"/lD433MCsszP7j0Hf8Fpf7MXdEn5.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"1.
