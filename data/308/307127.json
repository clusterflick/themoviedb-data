Dolma is regarded as a Bodhisattva of compassion and action. She is known as the mother of all buddhas. Our team felt that Dolma relates to the message we would like to convey via our movie and used her name in the documentary title. One of the main legends about her origin as a bodhisattva tells a story of a young princess who lived in a different world millions of years ago. Her name is Jnanachandra.","popularity":0.1408,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":236393,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arrabona Studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"},{"iso_3166_1":"NP","name":"Nepal"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daughters of Dolma","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1791780,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ádám Miklós","original_name":"Ádám Miklós","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58e7fc6ac3a36872f6054e0f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4885455,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alex Co","original_name":"Alex Co","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bc99f38d61371b07665bb4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1791780,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ádám Miklós","original_name":"Ádám Miklós","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bc9a119d39cb8b1ac35377","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3431998","wikidata_id":"Q16256479","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":309328,"name":"documentary short"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
