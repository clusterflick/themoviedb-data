Suddenly his toughest competitor is nowhere to be found: Edward Loos, an architect and loner in real life, who is better than anyone else as an air guitarist, has disappeared and nobody seems to be bothered by it.  Although this is not actually a case for Missing Persons Division 11 - Loos has disappeared but has not been reported missing - Inspector Süden and his team trust Heuer's intuition and set out to search for an air guitarist who has vanished into thin air. But another spooky case is keeping the missing persons department busy. A man claims to have seen his wife, who died in the 2004 tsunami, again in the Munich subway.","popularity":0.5412,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":87550,"logo_path":null,"name":"MOOVIE the art of entertainment","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2009-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kommissar Süden und der Luftgitarrist","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ulrich Noethen","original_name":"Ulrich Noethen","popularity":0.2812,"profile_path":"/wetpWDhR88VBNXq1vjq6JT8N4O1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tabor Süden","credit_id":"547ba93fc3a3685af0000da2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Feifel","original_name":"Martin Feifel","popularity":0.4732,"profile_path":"/pqJIPUoL1rPAjBHJtXGNPfiyDtW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Martin Heuer","credit_id":"547ba94ec3a3685b05000dd0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":49018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanette Hain","original_name":"Jeanette Hain","popularity":0.616,"profile_path":"/hfE2fjdms4XW1LZphRQ1JwFoha7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sonja Feyerabend","credit_id":"547ba962c3a3685b00000e00","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philipp Moog","original_name":"Philipp Moog","popularity":0.2884,"profile_path":"/dY4zjHrVdI88rcgzmv8Lu21Cllk.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ludwig Hornung","credit_id":"547ba9739251412d7f000cf4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":38720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Proll","original_name":"Nina Proll","popularity":0.4771,"profile_path":"/eQP4vr0Okc7EIK55iF1ACeMA3sD.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Rosina Hornung","credit_id":"547ba982c3a3685aed000edc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":38584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olivia Pascal","original_name":"Olivia Pascal","popularity":0.339,"profile_path":"/wJEsxjzRJGPmVmEP3Vrl65cusne.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Lilo","credit_id":"547ba9a49251412d73000cb6","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32958,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominik Graf","original_name":"Dominik Graf","popularity":0.2632,"profile_path":"/bVkXsyYYLPvDda1o7LQsWGQAWKn.jpg","credit_id":"547ba92d9251412d6d000cc4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150762,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alexander Fischerkoesen","original_name":"Alexander Fischerkoesen","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/e936KZVavJOcR5X2M7qXXfCDrXC.jpg","credit_id":"67cabaabdba14916062b4cb8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1245906","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":848,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6r3VYzRKaSkXmK9DmGN2iJh5Pkq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1509},{"aspect_ratio":1.776,"height":844,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1b14EmCejxK8WjWxzvRMQLpNnrG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1499},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zkIMM8YPCJhwE8yFQlfKkO7nXWp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ZDF","release_date":"2009-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
