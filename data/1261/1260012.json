His turbulent three years in the role saw clashes with star Tom Baker, budgetary nightmares and catastrophic industrial action – but also the highest viewing figures the programme has ever achieved. Graham died in 1990, aged just 45, leaving behind a wife and three young children. In this intimate new film, Graham’s family, friends and colleagues look back on a life of darkness and light.","popularity":0.1288,"poster_path":"/5ObEMriH2L3XRM9ukyFZs5RTzUB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125163,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moon Balloon","origin_country":""},{"id":80893,"logo_path":"/hFzOkuR4FoZE1U1hvuojMp4Qfxa.png","name":"BBC Studios","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Darkness & Light: The Life of Graham Williams","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1229846,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Graham Williams","original_name":"Graham Williams","popularity":0.1646,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself (archive footage)","credit_id":"65f58234156cc7013260dd4a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2378819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Chapman","original_name":"Chris Chapman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/fE3xIaqfddtCmPIvjgCHVdeEXrt.jpg","credit_id":"65f581c7156cc7017e620e0d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5ObEMriH2L3XRM9ukyFZs5RTzUB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1538}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":330010,"name":"blu-ray"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
