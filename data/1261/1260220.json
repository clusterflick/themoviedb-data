The outcast child of a society that often has no room for those who do not fit into molds, Ciretta will find refuge and companionship among the people who gather around an old theater in Naples, now closed due to the pandemic. There he will dream of the possibility of a better life, until the theater is sold to become a hotel. Ciretta will be forced to find a new haven for both himself and his beloved statue of the Madonna, in this tender, melancholy tale of battered people who seem born to be movie heroes, and a city that changes almost before your eyes.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/7BbiHgGmcp9TEE11lVePeHdAUDd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gospel According to Ciretta","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4460769,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Caroline von der Tann","original_name":"Caroline von der Tann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660f33cc88c659017c9c1a14","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7BbiHgGmcp9TEE11lVePeHdAUDd.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"26th Thessaloniki International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2024-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
