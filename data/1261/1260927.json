The price farmers receive for coffee is at its lowest in over thirty years. Coffee plantation owners are bankrupt and the workers are starving. Filmed in Nicaragua and Vietnam, the film describes the human consequences that the collapse of coffee prices has caused in producer countries. Multinational companies have profited because coffee is so cheap. The crisis is worldwide: the International Coffee Organization says that the price crash has pushed over 25 million people into poverty as farmers who used to grow food now sell coffee.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5975,"logo_path":"/vvjgoKygWWYZvYyidT3RmOCq5If.png","name":"YLE","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Victims of Cheap Coffee","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4600034,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pertti Pesonen","original_name":"Pertti Pesonen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f7c688ef9d72017ed67501","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
