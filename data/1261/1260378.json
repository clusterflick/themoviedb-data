Hundreds of them. On airport runways, in schools, hospitals, nursing homes, at the beach, in churches and monasteries, on game reserves, in town squares, fire stations, police stations….anywhere and everywhere from Austria to Zimbabwe.  I was very moved when I discovered the videos during the pandemic, so I wanted to celebrate how so many people took up the challenge and danced with joy and hope.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From A to Z: Jerusalema in 44 countries","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4597228,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aaron Mason","original_name":"Aaron Mason","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f62031a6fdaa01646cdcb4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1012174,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Su Friedrich","original_name":"Su Friedrich","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/nof0cZDTxovGwd1gnoK1r3dJQO4.jpg","credit_id":"65f61e00e194b0017cbd904f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1012174,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Su Friedrich","original_name":"Su Friedrich","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/nof0cZDTxovGwd1gnoK1r3dJQO4.jpg","credit_id":"65f61e2bbbe1dd014af16627","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"“From A to Z: Jerusalema in 44 countries” by Su Friedrich (2024)","key":"915991109","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2024-02-23T15:18:09.000Z","id":"65f620b281da390186617d78"}]}}}
