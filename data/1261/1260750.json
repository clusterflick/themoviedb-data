From the very beginning until today, these are amateur publications that deal with less popular, often even obscure topics. Fanzines experienced their heyday with the emergence of punk culture, but although fans of underground music were the most active creators of this form of expression, fanzines often deal with socially engaged topics, art, sports and so on. When mainstream culture does not provide enough information, or when it does not allow you to express your ideas, attitudes and interests in a way that is close to you, you can take matters into your own hands and publish everything you want in a fanzine, of which you are the creator, publisher and distributor.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/qKWl5DL1EQFgVdtY6BeLZqUKQZd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94690,"logo_path":null,"name":"Radio-televizija Vojvodine","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fanzine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2122804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daško Milinović","original_name":"Daško Milinović","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/1dfMf7u62A8Q6ufDhs65sz2d7dO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"65f991e5798c94018516769b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4416482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Igor Todorović 'Zgro'","original_name":"Igor Todorović 'Zgro'","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"65f9920d549dda01637d0831","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4338758,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vojin Ivkov","original_name":"Vojin Ivkov","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f735f0ae3843017d4a97ce","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4338758,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vojin Ivkov","original_name":"Vojin Ivkov","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f735f6a6fdaa017d6e1b02","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qKWl5DL1EQFgVdtY6BeLZqUKQZd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
