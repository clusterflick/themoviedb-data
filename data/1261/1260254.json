She was the first to speak out against the 'special military operation' in Ukraine: she changed the price tags in a supermarket and put information about the war on them. Now Sasha is in prison, facing trial. Through the eyes of her friends Sonia and Lesha we witness the ongoing trial up close, exposing the absurdities and inhumanity of the Russian legal system, and the threats that the group of friends who support Sasha encounter in daily life. Over 18 months they await the final verdict. In November 2023, Sasha is sentenced to another 7 years imprisonment for her artistic rebellion.","popularity":0.296,"poster_path":"/iKXr6VCFRzRRIonhZNE8APPWWvJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2291,"logo_path":null,"name":"Journeyman Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Message from Sasha","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Sasha's message","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"Bericht van Sasha","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4596873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sasha Skochilenko","original_name":"Sasha Skochilenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65f5e177e210230165ed5622","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4596874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonya Subbotina","original_name":"Sonya Subbotina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65f5e1825907de017ce5337d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4596875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yana Nepovinnova","original_name":"Yanna Nepovinnaya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65f5e194242f940164cb4c83","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4596877,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jos de Putter","original_name":"Jos de Putter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f5e1ce66469a017e797193","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4596876,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Rudikova","original_name":"Anna Rudikova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f5e1b6d8f44e01634edcb2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31514779","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3UKV0oUYyluOm9QroX5xQmolDwG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3MKPtUSn3XCnrC7dWLlIE4mU2Fz.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8zQXp1EvE7TvobpJ8Wh0o1NXIxK.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":640},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iKXr6VCFRzRRIonhZNE8APPWWvJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1067}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Women Make Waves International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
