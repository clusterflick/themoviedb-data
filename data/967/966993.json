In the seven-episode series, Gronowski outlines their history from 1972 to 1980. During this time, the characters begin their adult life, start families, experience the taste of their first successes and failures. Their energy, desire to transform the world, sense of justice, moral sensitivity, but also impatience and inexperience collide with the indifference, cynicism and opportunism of the elderly. Vitality and idealism meet a barrier of ossified systems and informal, unclear connections. The young heroes feel that they are needed by each other. They support each other in difficult times, their friendship matures with them.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":417,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dorastanie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7605270","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pl","note":"","release_date":"1989-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
