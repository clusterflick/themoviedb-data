The tape begins with a tableau of architectural stone to a saxophone player (Charlie Braden, a musician from Minneapolis) who is playing through a 34 foot elevated rectangular tube wood structure. The intention was to support a \"physical soundtrack.\" The piece then moves to an outdoor garden restaurant setting during the credits, where a mental patient speaks of various subjects, shifting the emphasis away from the previous content.\" - David Askevold","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/tKPEE7sVoRre0HmmYeL20Ic5z4V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jumped Out","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3518936,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Charlie Braden","original_name":"Charlie Braden","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6263395ec1ffbd10a2346f11","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2360512,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Askevold","original_name":"David Askevold","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/9XY9ZTGQCt2PY4QMDfRKHKVSlQj.jpg","credit_id":"62633965c1ffbd10a348f917","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tKPEE7sVoRre0HmmYeL20Ic5z4V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
