After kidnapping and robbing a man, two lovers - Sweetie and Rose - keep him captive in his bed. When Rose leaves, Sweetie is left alone with the prisoner, where she begins to project a twisted metaphysical bond. Exceedingly atmospheric, Fält’s film stars two NoBudge regulars, Kate Adams and Anna Cordell, in performances brimming with intensity.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bandits","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1990354,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Natalie Fält","original_name":"Natalie Fält","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6262ffc4e61e6d00662a018f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1990354,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Natalie Fält","original_name":"Natalie Fält","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6262ffb2322b2b4fe29d0626","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
