The cherry-tree branches are full of ripe berries, swaying from the wind and weight. A recently retired father invites his son to help him with the cherry picking in the garden. The father is not in a rush, as he now wants to spend more time with his son, leaving the cherries in the background. Working together and staying silent, they both realize how much time they’ve lost during those 30 years. The cherries bring the two men back to their first memories and let them experience them longer, as if to start all over again.","popularity":0.1166,"poster_path":"/qTAZQhrOkcM4QklxSImABeuceVk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122579,"logo_path":"/wDrNmZwLOPhMMvbNteW1z3JLsCF.png","name":"M-Films","origin_country":"LT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2022-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cherries","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1568886,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vytautas Katkus","original_name":"Vytautas Katkus","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/muEdMFL3hdfKTu4x7uKGTCsN7uz.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"62641e436ca9a000aa69b188","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3519729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viktoras Katkus","original_name":"Viktoras Katkus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"62641e586eecee30f2cc177c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4990871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Audrius Luciunas","original_name":"Audrius Luciunas","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Twin","credit_id":"6706e1a33abedc1d3b6a205f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4990872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vitalijus Luciunas","original_name":"Vitalijus Luciunas","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Twin","credit_id":"6706e1ac4d7a645f93522596","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2393461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vismantė Ruzgaitė","original_name":"Vismantė Ruzgaitė","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Girl","credit_id":"6706e1b93abedc1d3b6a2075","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1568886,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vytautas Katkus","original_name":"Vytautas Katkus","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/muEdMFL3hdfKTu4x7uKGTCsN7uz.jpg","credit_id":"62641ceb4dc34a00500dd872","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1771470,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marija Razgutė","original_name":"Marija Razgutė","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/8sfBSaYQVWTzGIy4DJo9Ygw53yd.jpg","credit_id":"62641dd98fdda90050636182","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1568886,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vytautas Katkus","original_name":"Vytautas Katkus","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/muEdMFL3hdfKTu4x7uKGTCsN7uz.jpg","credit_id":"62641de4aaec71009d8d8a76","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2499953,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Simonas Glinskis","original_name":"Simonas Glinskis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62641df21495651653973953","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1743454,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurynas Bareiša","original_name":"Laurynas Bareiša","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":"/gYjvSIbg79LQwnQDfH6bokoypTJ.jpg","credit_id":"62641e007caa4714b34b7a1a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2034588,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Julius Grigelionis","original_name":"Julius Grigelionis","popularity":0.0988,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62641e104dc34a00659ba900","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18937168","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1103,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qTAZQhrOkcM4QklxSImABeuceVk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":780},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1697,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1HDe8lOSq13dAwYqbjHwQK59rhJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":1131}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":13088,"name":"summer"},{"id":240119,"name":"father son relationship"},{"id":248870,"name":"memories"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cannes Film Festival","release_date":"2022-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
