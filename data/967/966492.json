A cynical look at figures which are moving in a repetitive manner as a sort of pendulum which reflects the passing of time. The figures are constantly moving, however they are not advancing anywhere. Their action loses its meaning and becomes pointless. Both the viewer and the figures enter a meditative state in which nothing happens except for waiting.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/j1iJ0cXARIOua024up3cfz7QJDs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Floats","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3519223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Idan Barzilay","original_name":"Idan Barzilay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62639789ed96bc00a6d03990","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3253688,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mor Israeli","original_name":"Mor Israeli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626397947fcab350a5fa5563","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3519223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Idan Barzilay","original_name":"Idan Barzilay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6558e501ca0e1700c6ab2c37","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3253688,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mor Israeli","original_name":"Mor Israeli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6558e50e0816c700fd31dee3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3197996","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j1iJ0cXARIOua024up3cfz7QJDs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Floats","key":"79380715","site":"Vimeo","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2013-11-14T10:01:41.000Z","id":"626397d91bf26600a6871293"}]}}}
