A picture of the life of a multigenerational family in the period of rapid social and political changes - just after World War II, until the 1970s. All Kanderowie work in the mine. Newcomers from other parts of Poland appear here. Their lifestyle and moral freedom differ from the rules of life of a traditional, patriarchal Silesian family. This often causes conflicts and fights with \"aliens\". Moral changes are slowly taking place in the everyday life of the younger generation, but the pattern of a traditional family is still strong.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/cvWNfI1urryNJ9RCPww7bACbxdj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":577,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rodzina Kanderów","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0429426","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cvWNfI1urryNJ9RCPww7bACbxdj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pl","note":"","release_date":"1990-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
