The writer outlined the image of the village at the turn of the 1980s on the example of the Małolepsza family from the village of Gudzewo. They manage a few hectares, the older children left for the city, they settled in, one of the sons even became a lawyer. Twenty-year-old Bolek stayed with his parents, a boy willing to \"fight and drink\", wandering with his peers as crude as he was, lonely, because most of the girls fled to the city.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":352,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"W słońcu i w deszczu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0929722","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pl","note":"","release_date":"1980-02-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
