A television director for almost 20 years, Jamie has produced groundbreaking programmes that take a fresh look at disability, as well as making popular travelogue shows with some of the UK’s funniest talent, including Karl Pilkington, Romesh Ranganathan and Katherine Ryan.  At this pivotal point in his life, O’Leary wants to explore how people cope with sight loss and how blind artists achieve their creative vision of a world they see from a unique perspective. So he has hooked up with blind observational comedian Jamie MacDonald to bring light and shade to facing the condition. Together, they’re on a blind-leading-the-nearly-blind mission to uncover and collaborate with the best blind creative talent.","popularity":0.1087,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":173975,"logo_path":null,"name":"Television Repairs Ltd","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"TV director Jamie O’Leary faces eye surgery that could lead to sight loss.
