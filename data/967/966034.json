For a full day David Askevold set up a feeder to see the reaction of the crows (who regularly fly around his backyard) to his camera he had placed on a tripod nearby. The resulting footage is juxtaposed with the letters Grevatt wrote to long time friend Norma Ready between October 1993 and July 1994. Background sound consists of appropriated music from the radio and original keyboard music by Askevold created while listening to the three tracks and viewing the edited footage.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/g5siPsIcWKXwK9iHeLOZPXmoxxl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don't Eat Crow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3517811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katherine Grevatt","original_name":"Katherine Grevatt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"62624b2c447f9c0065763c45","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3517811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katherine Grevatt","original_name":"Katherine Grevatt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62624b33447f9c0065763c60","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2360512,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Askevold","original_name":"David Askevold","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/9XY9ZTGQCt2PY4QMDfRKHKVSlQj.jpg","credit_id":"62624b3b3f48330067f0c82a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2360512,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Askevold","original_name":"David Askevold","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/9XY9ZTGQCt2PY4QMDfRKHKVSlQj.jpg","credit_id":"62624b42fbe36f00a1d5394e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g5siPsIcWKXwK9iHeLOZPXmoxxl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
