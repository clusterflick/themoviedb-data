She has long wanted to make a film that brings together people from across Wales to share their experiences of what it means to be black and Welsh. Now she has done just that. Weaving together a collection of engaging stories, she meets people from Newport in the south to Snowdonia in the north, and from a 19-year-old model storming to international runway success to a 92-year-old whose arrival in Wales predates the Empire Windrush.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/7UpZWDeVz2CXBZNYVKvhUagABkZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Welsh","iso_639_1":"cy","name":"Cymraeg"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black & Welsh","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3473838,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liana Stewart","original_name":"Liana Stewart","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62650291f495ee303ca4ed60","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3520836,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jemma Boulter","original_name":"Jemma Boulter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62650b85a35c8e129f4beebb","department":"Production","job":"Trainee Production Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3520837,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ali Goolyad","original_name":"Ali Goolyad","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62650b93d8f44e0067361465","department":"Production","job":"Trainee Production Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3520838,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Louise Jenkins","original_name":"Louise Jenkins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62650ba17caa4714b34ebe1f","department":"Camera","job":"Data Wrangler"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3520839,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ren Faulkner","original_name":"Ren Faulkner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62650bc8d8f44e005113a1ee","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3520840,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Max Hughes","original_name":"Max Hughes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62650bdbfbe36f0054570232","department":"Crew","job":"Mixing Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3520841,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kurt Williams","original_name":"Kurt Williams","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62650bf70929f61693c3dac7","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3520842,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mark James","original_name":"Mark James","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62650c0aaaec71009d90f149","department":"Crew","job":"Title Graphics"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3520843,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nathan J Carr","original_name":"Nathan J Carr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62650c230929f61693c3db50","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2936321,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Emily Almond Barr","original_name":"Emily Almond Barr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62650c32aaec7100511c2e37","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1313016,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Catryn Ramasut","original_name":"Catryn Ramasut","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62650c526ca9a000660bd564","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3520846,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sian Harris","original_name":"Sian Harris","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62650c68d8f44e009e7d4981","department":"Crew","job":"Commissioning Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.661,"height":776,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7UpZWDeVz2CXBZNYVKvhUagABkZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":513}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"English, Welsh","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
