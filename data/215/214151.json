He assists her whenever he can. In the weekly newspaper \"Alt Ausseer Bote\" he reports on a foundling that has been handed in at the baby hatch of Bad Aussee hospital, and is subsequently dismissed by editor-in-chief Anton Grimmeisen. But when the editor Caroline Moosbichler hears about it, she demands Florian's immediate reinstatement. He is to stay on the story. In the process, he finds out that the mother acted out of pure desperation, and he gets on the trail of the love between Jutta Lechner and Thomas Gschnitzer. This love is the origin of the child.","popularity":0.6681,"poster_path":"/8W4zndqnsRMd4iR4yGoQLKCmNKg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3391,"logo_path":"/t0QBs2fI3mE3HxgoH1n39bYuzNu.png","name":"ORF","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":1018,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lisa
