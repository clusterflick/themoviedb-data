He suddenly notices that the cheese is a little out of the ordinary, and examines it with his glass. To his horror, he finds it to be alive with mites, and, in disgust, leaves the table. Hundreds of mites resembling crabs are seen scurrying in all directions. A wonderful picture and a subject hitherto unthought of in animated photography. Notable for being the first science film made for the general public.","popularity":0.0641,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":45003,"logo_path":null,"name":"Micro Bioscope","origin_country":""},{"id":44771,"logo_path":"/bfyrVfFnmmcanicDhqD9PNxbUHw.png","name":"Charles Urban Trading Company","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1903-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cheese Mites","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1198943,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"F.
