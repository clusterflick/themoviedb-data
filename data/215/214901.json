Knowing that starry night something was about to happen, no one really understood what the special star they spotted meant.  This comical group of friends, a Cow (Ismay), a Mouse (Slink), a Horse (Monty), a Pig (Horace), and a Rooster (Drake) are about to have an important house guest to their small stable in Bethlehem. Word on the street is that a King is coving to visit, but why to a stable? What kind of gift could they present to the King?  Experience this hilarious tale of the very first Christmas and learn that there's more to life than being able to burp the loudest, be the party clown or even give the nicest gift! Recommended for ages 5 to 10. Running time is approximately 23 minutes.","popularity":0.1063,"poster_path":"/moMG5hkdTOiyJjNg7HVFhd0CF4n.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30218,"logo_path":null,"name":"Character Matters","origin_country":""},{"id":30216,"logo_path":"/AwgLu0qw2UifWdDYExBNlZXWwx.png","name":"Sunrise Productions","origin_country":"ZA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Once Upon a Stable","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Era Uma Vez no Est√°bulo","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3296199,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Shoultz","original_name":"Chris Shoultz","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61833bfe84f249008d4581fc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3296201,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Boris Goreta","original_name":"Boris Goreta","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61833c268ed03f002d078d92","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Lead Animator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2508883,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brent Dawes","original_name":"Brent Dawes","popularity":0.139,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61833b6f1c6aa700896da5a9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3296199,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Shoultz","original_name":"Chris Shoultz","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61833bf0e741460060f1197c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2125896,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mike Buckland","original_name":"Mike Buckland","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61833bc6ddd52d0026b4bc4c","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Lead Animator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3063047,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Phil Cunningham","original_name":"Phil Cunningham","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61833b48a097dc00922d72a8","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2838798,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jacqui Cunningham","original_name":"Jacqui Cunningham","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61833b58c7c22400656d04d9","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2279138","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.776,"height":1216,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/6pDvtmxWi6XAOcmvtSZlBZoH81g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2160}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":1.422,"height":630,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/1BPKH30Tv1aF6Blv7YsEVHJlkDi.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":896}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/moMG5hkdTOiyJjNg7HVFhd0CF4n.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/iTVf1g1ydag5a8vJIScK31mRwe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
