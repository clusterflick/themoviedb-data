Nights were spent in gyms, kindergartens or swimming baths on own mats, there where no accompanying service teams, no closed streets during the racing day... The performance expectations were turned upside down. It's not just about physical fitness but also about who can master this huge challenge in their head. Women become dreaded opponents of men. Ideal age is 40 - that's when mind and body are equally strong.","popularity":0.078,"poster_path":"/7FyGONkBNoLPnj3BghN8rQ4w8i4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16828,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmband","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2012-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I want to run -
