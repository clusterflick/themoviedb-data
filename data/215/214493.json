All were happy for the couple except one, Set, a jealous man who killed Osiris in order to take over his kingdom. Isis snuck into Osiris' tomb and tried to raise him from the dead using her black magic. Set caught Isis in the act and had Osiris cut to pieces, with each piece buried in a different part of the land, so Isis could never again raise her husband. Isis vowed to avenge Osiris' death and return with him to rule over all the worlds. Now, six college students take their last course in archeology in anticipation for graduation. Their last assignment is to uncover and document the museum's new acquisitions with their teacher, Prof. Shields and world-renowned Egyptologist Dr. Nasir. During the night they haphazardly awaken the ancient spirit of Isis' lost soul and her wrath is unleashed on the group.","popularity":0.6432,"poster_path":"/RLnhthMaG2iLZl3Y8bqqsX8Qox.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Raising the dead never looked this good","title":"Isis Rising: Curse of the Lady Mummy","video":false,"vote_average":2.529,"vote_count":17,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"木乃伊女士的诅咒","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":137480,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Priya Rai","original_name":"Priya Rai","popularity":2.654,"profile_path":"/to2UgeWFrOJuXEuZog1dbcwIvVw.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Isis","credit_id":"55107a5792514146a000ce90","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seth Gandrud","original_name":"Seth Gandrud","popularity":0.091,"profile_path":"/oi1tnVxcHIZ3zwkbbjlzp3AsV3Q.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dr. Nasir","credit_id":"52fe4de1c3a368484e2029af","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":572621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Bartholet","original_name":"James Bartholet","popularity":1.55,"profile_path":"/az7pMOICzjbfSRS7Nv3H10Oyfx8.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Henry","credit_id":"543d63e40e0a266f77000184","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1283770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William 'Bill' Connor","original_name":"William 'Bill' Connor","popularity":0.1684,"profile_path":"/AqGdphT9QHwfQALznoEYDL9GVUA.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Reaper","credit_id":"52fe4de1c3a368484e2029bd","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1283768,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa Palenica","original_name":"Lisa Palenica","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/3XZpm5Y4p7umeVBwVr5HLryWOVI.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4de1c3a368484e2029b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1283768,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa Palenica","original_name":"Lisa Palenica","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/3XZpm5Y4p7umeVBwVr5HLryWOVI.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4de1c3a368484e2029cf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9477,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ted Chalmers","original_name":"Ted Chalmers","popularity":0.1079,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630a826aede1b00083c31059","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1283773,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Annie T.
