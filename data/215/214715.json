He sets off to catch a live pygmy, with help from a tracking dog, but the dog isn't the world's most efficient, distracted first by some flowers, then when he actually encounters a pygmy, by the bone in his hair. Ultimately, he buries the pygmy; the Captain comes chasing along. With this crew, the pygmy's in no danger. Eventually, the pygmy swaps clothes with the Inspector; he runs off and grabs his whole tribe, and the safari crew takes off.","popularity":0.2061,"poster_path":"/653IYiTRekGICfCasz7TVlygsk8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1938-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pygmy Hunt","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Friz Freleng","original_name":"Friz Freleng","popularity":0.3307,"profile_path":"/v7CtAOi4eLJkyu9bZN1yC8e5Wco.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4de7c3a368484e204063","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0030638","wikidata_id":"Q30754030","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/juNZ9h85buankFlod280Kcv5Kst.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/653IYiTRekGICfCasz7TVlygsk8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1938-08-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
