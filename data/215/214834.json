In Description d’un Combat, Marker’s idiosyncratic style, combining location footage with archival material, builds a complex and personal portrayal. Israel’s demography is explored, from the kibbutzim to the Arab minorities, the orthodox Jews, and the tourists. The “battle” of the title does not refer to the tank-and-artillery variety, but to the inner struggle of Israeli citizens to adapt to a new view of themselves, in a new country.","popularity":0.2059,"poster_path":"/hJVXT3bAXIQUsNM2T3qxh82SXjy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16271,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sophac","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1960-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Description of a Struggle","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Hatzad Hashlishi Shel Hamatbaya","type":"Hebrew"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Beschreibung eines Kampfes","type":"German"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1372212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Adair","original_name":"Alan Adair","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/y3UG9AwvjYgAQrNtj3yttR9CYyi.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5ae878120e0a26104f018f2a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9956,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Marker","original_name":"Chris Marker","popularity":0.3545,"profile_path":"/4hcLsvsYKcjx5oJJ0IshXK9L1l9.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4deac3a368484e20485f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9956,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Marker","original_name":"Chris Marker","popularity":0.3545,"profile_path":"/4hcLsvsYKcjx5oJJ0IshXK9L1l9.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4deac3a368484e204865","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1199651,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"yitzhak zohar","original_name":"yitzhak zohar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4deac3a368484e20486b","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1199652,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wim Van Leer","original_name":"Wim Van Leer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4deac3a368484e204871","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11988,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ghislain Cloquet","original_name":"Ghislain Cloquet","popularity":0.1336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac97ddd0e0a26496b0560d1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":32015,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Eva Zora","original_name":"Eva Zora","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac97e16c3a36834e80541d4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0054799","wikidata_id":"Q16028392","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1008,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hTMCbnYRyLlXteWHKqKWVDY7E2W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1792}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.73,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/hJVXT3bAXIQUsNM2T3qxh82SXjy.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":788},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/2WS8OsVVTqGIpIu2ufUXwPlGxev.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1961-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1960-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"DESCRIPTION D'UN COMBAT de Chris MARKER - 1960 -Official trailer","key":"rlviHXs-ydE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-01-05T19:27:10.000Z","id":"672099ba6e4210780f79a6c0"}]}}}
