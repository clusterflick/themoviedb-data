The girl, whom Max has never met, is also stage struck, and entertains no wish of marrying him, though her mother is anxious to see her make the alliance. The parents finally manage to bring the young people together, and they, in turn, exert all their skill in an attempt to disgust each other. An accidental meeting between the two when they are off guard causes them to change their minds.","popularity":0.1424,"poster_path":"/8Eu0B8GXDeprzZsNZDk2BT7oigZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1911-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Max and Jane Want to Do Theater","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","title":"Max und Jane wollen Schauspieler werden","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Max und Jane wollen Schauspieler werden","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Max y Juana desean hacerse actores","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le feu sacré","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Max a le feu sacré","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Max veut faire du théâtre","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Their Common Destiny","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Max's Tragedy","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Max Plays at Drama","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1016035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Linder","original_name":"Max Linder","popularity":0.1786,"profile_path":"/b3PKyHuw6OyOATZeyOPJkC000mY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Max","credit_id":"52fe4de0c3a368484e20274d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1090769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Renouardt","original_name":"Jane Renouardt","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Jane","credit_id":"52fe4de0c3a368484e202751","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1419818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henri Collen","original_name":"Henri Collen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"58017694c3a368310d000d8a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1223538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabrielle Lange","original_name":"Gabrielle Lange","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":"/4U53R7i1sLwDDf3vXUX8itw9bPP.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"58017698c3a3683109000d15","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1146135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Mosnier","original_name":"Charles Mosnier","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/eEGsw7Fzo9ifpMzkqsKmfMgic7j.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5801769c925141012d000d01","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1016035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Linder","original_name":"Max Linder","popularity":0.1786,"profile_path":"/b3PKyHuw6OyOATZeyOPJkC000mY.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4de0c3a368484e202749","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090768,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"René Leprince","original_name":"René Leprince","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/w7BirzeWR87NoqM6KekRfRCQVtF.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4de0c3a368484e202743","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1016035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Linder","original_name":"Max Linder","popularity":0.1786,"profile_path":"/b3PKyHuw6OyOATZeyOPJkC000mY.jpg","credit_id":"58017686c3a3683125000c28","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0002354","wikidata_id":"Q23899196","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dJExLi0e3uH64Vuvj4A4HwCJJzz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rd7hH0EFfznrd9E2gn3yONBezuZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/8Eu0B8GXDeprzZsNZDk2BT7oigZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/NodJZrAqVh5akstIqaoQy5FciJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1911-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1912-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1912-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Max's Tragedy (1911)","key":"owCdrvUVN4M","published_at":"2015-11-04T13:25:52.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"5b6a1188c3a3681886134aa4"}]}}}
