The work uses only and exclusively found footage and material from the film, and implodes it to create a new audiovisual work, a new visual sound experience. The result is an experimental vision that pretends to expand the way we perceive films and tries to push our notion of audiovisual sensations.","popularity":0.0412,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"(Archive Works, AW#06)","title":"1812: War and Peace Studies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170724,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Casas","original_name":"Carlos Casas","popularity":0.0918,"profile_path":"/psABqoL4Ja4j6o5FdvBNc4TrGK9.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4de3c3a368484e2030af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-08-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
