Herman Prey's Figaro is admirably sung in a firm baritone and aptly characterized. So too, is his antagonist, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau as the Count perpetually frustrated by the scheming wiles of Figaro and Susanna, here the perky Mirella Freni, who sings and acts like a dream. The Countess is creamy-voiced Kiri Te Kanawa, and the Cherubino, Maria Ewing, looks just like the horny, teenaged page she's supposed to be. The all-star leads are complemented by worthy supporting singers, the Vienna Philharmonic at the top of its form, and the experienced Mozartian, Karl Böhm conducting a stylishly fleet performance.","popularity":0.2688,"poster_path":"/vPEtwxIebeXeICHQhwvRDiiP4T0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":10706,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unitel Classics","origin_country":""},{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":181,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Marriage of Figaro","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hermann Prey","original_name":"Hermann Prey","popularity":0.1418,"profile_path":"/ryEWZxs7ukCREWcRaxqenrHR9Yc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Figaro","credit_id":"52fe4de7c3a368484e203e6d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":938939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mirella Freni","original_name":"Mirella Freni","popularity":0.1439,"profile_path":"/gJZMLaFza1HUh5onrOu1TI0S0Mx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Susanna","credit_id":"52fe4de7c3a368484e203e71","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau","original_name":"Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/cliPNLk9DNIy7vPglYAijmVq6bY.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Il Conte di Almaviva","credit_id":"52fe4de7c3a368484e203e75","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1225312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kiri Te Kanawa","original_name":"Kiri Te Kanawa","popularity":0.2451,"profile_path":"/6AqPGMfsMrEwhqoNWEvJVL9Giij.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"La Contessa di Almaviva","credit_id":"56b3805ac3a36806e6002252","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1299309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Ewing","original_name":"Maria Ewing","popularity":0.1583,"profile_path":"/vSWBBRRh04UzocS22TZvVnFvhfm.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Cherubino","credit_id":"5319b5d3c3a3685c43002da0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1157666,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heather Begg","original_name":"Heather Begg","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Marcellina","credit_id":"5319c143c3a3685c51002d5b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1202994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paolo Montarsolo","original_name":"Paolo Montarsolo","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/3nvD95PexgrmaQF8hezF6fGEQOc.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Bartolo","credit_id":"5319c15ac3a3685c56002e5c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1155495,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John van Kesteren","original_name":"John van Kesteren","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Basilio","credit_id":"5319c169c3a3685c51002d64","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1299337,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willy Caron","original_name":"Willy Caron","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Don Curzio","credit_id":"5319c173c3a3685c4a002fcb","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1299338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Kraemmer","original_name":"Hans Kraemmer","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Antonio","credit_id":"5319c182c3a3685c51002d6c","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1118125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janet Perry","original_name":"Janet Perry","popularity":0.0497,"profile_path":"/ubgxUDRW8Yct0AnGHW7XIbAhAu0.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Barbarina","credit_id":"5319c18ec3a3685c5d002e26","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":929015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Böhm","original_name":"Karl Böhm","popularity":0.0611,"profile_path":"/vWn2Ys2AMzlULNwpFszYCbiyPfO.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Self -
