By chance, the girl from the restaurant is also bound for the Balkans. While on board, Dick undertakes to renew his acquaintance with this attractive foreigner, but encounters considerable resistance. In Lithuania, Dick meets with Count Vortsky, the Minister of Finance, who presses him to sell his cattle concession, hoping to clinch a coup attempt he is planning with the Bulgarian Ambassador. Somewhat suspicious, Dick agrees to announce his decision only in the presence of Princess Alexia, who turns out to be the girl from the restaurant.","popularity":0.2166,"poster_path":"/8x9eOGi0t7zMr0CCIse3Z4IZFMs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Yankee Way","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":633744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Walsh","original_name":"George Walsh","popularity":0.1347,"profile_path":"/hLkVjr3BHI9FyBI2I1vqWr6s3NB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dick Mason","credit_id":"62f3e2bb6f31af00916d1091","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enid Markey","original_name":"Enid Markey","popularity":0.2145,"profile_path":"/ihoIvZF4nk59zhleufqy0clpSGa.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Princess Alexia","credit_id":"62f3e2cbd2f5b50080dfaed4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph J.
