As a child, he was brought to England on a slave ship from Senegal and grew up as a servant of Sir John Phillips. He later gained independence and became a successful coal merchant and a wealthy gentleman who lived in a white house by the River Thames.  A local man comes across this white house during a walk through the town centre. He calls a phone number that he finds on a sign outside the building. At a time of restricted human interaction, this attempt to make contact with the houseâ€™s former inhabitant from 200 years ago takes an unexpected turn.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/dqV7J73UcnWGnkVgp2oUlOrkMM5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"9,000 Square Feet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3658993,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Akari Yasuda-Akiki","original_name":"Akari Yasuda-Akiki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f423b4594c94007f4806cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dqV7J73UcnWGnkVgp2oUlOrkMM5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
