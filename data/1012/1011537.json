After being dead for over 200 years, Ourikaâ€™s soul is awoken inside of a barren purgatory while her body incubates in a fleshy blob. In the void, she encounters ghosts from her past life and depictions of her likeness that taunt her. She must see her true self to be set free. Ourika is unaware that two sister scientists, Velinda and Ronnell, twin spirits, have been searching for all the pieces of her soul in hopes that they can bring her back to life.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/s6HHTYQ50ZSwAnWESCQ2GcXVr06.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"OURIKA!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3343846,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xenia Matthews","original_name":"Xenia Matthews","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f54084c3bffe00877675b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt24400872","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":1619,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/s6HHTYQ50ZSwAnWESCQ2GcXVr06.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1086}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BlackStar Film Festival","release_date":"2022-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
