He asks his girlfriend Sally, who owns the base caf√©, for help. She goes to the base commander, Col. Baker--who she knows has a crush on her--to help out Herbert. Col. Baker schedules a promotion hearing for Herbert that Friday. He naturally fails it miserably, and then learns that Col. Baker is going out on a date with Sally. Meanwhile, the base military intelligence officer discovers that Herbert is a dead-ringer for the head of a spy ring intending to sabotage a new automated plane, and gets Herbert assigned to infiltrate the gang. Complications ensue.","popularity":1.0707,"poster_path":"/acmwMpjo0JynWBGYkFKA1BclSJF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5164,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sigmund Neufeld Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":142689,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spartan Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":180299,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tam Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1951-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The saddest sack in the sky!","title":"Sky High","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sid Melton","original_name":"Sid Melton","popularity":0.2307,"profile_path":"/zvrLwPm8eR3ABsu31R91MOc68IP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Herbert Pumice / Muscrat Maxie McClure","credit_id":"62f3e51c0b5fd600933bd310","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":130943,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mara Lynn","original_name":"Mara Lynn","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Sally","credit_id":"62f3e52cfea6e3009135cc89","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120736,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Flint","original_name":"Sam Flint","popularity":0.3098,"profile_path":"/iZXn3Myb6SVQifYpWt1aixEyqWJ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Col.
