She carries a sketching outfit and a carrier pigeon into the moonshine country, and hides the pigeon in the woods near a mountain cabin, where she hopes to make headquarters. She walks along the road until she sees Dave Parks coming, falls, feigns a sprained ankle, and is taken home by Dave, who is a young, good-looking moonshiner. Dave's mother is a sour-faced, pipe-smoking, suspicious old mountain woman, and only tolerates Dorothy. Nell Oatsey, typical mountain girl of bold beauty, hears of Dorothy's plight and goes to see her. She carries her rifle.","popularity":0.2042,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":37907,"logo_path":null,"name":"Balboa Amusement Producing Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Unexpected","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":587954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Belle Bennett","original_name":"Belle Bennett","popularity":0.174,"profile_path":"/otpvRREm8YtrXyyILwWxBvvZrdN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dorothy Madison","credit_id":"62f68e4a5c564e007ba08f40","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37362,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henry King","original_name":"Henry King","popularity":0.3557,"profile_path":"/bJpytCyMCSpoM3wlN8ZkeqZlr2b.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dave Parks","credit_id":"62f68e70813cb6007b360721","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1383758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madeline Pardee","original_name":"Madeline Pardee","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Mam Parks","credit_id":"62f68f97813cb600806f4d2a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3661489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Augusta Bolle","original_name":"Augusta Bolle","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Nell Oatsey","credit_id":"62f68fa7ecbde9008270dd54","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1383760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Whitman","original_name":"Fred Whitman","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Bill Oatsey","credit_id":"62f68fb6873f0000821cdf69","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1476427,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mollie McConnell","original_name":"Mollie McConnell","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":"/iPVpckFs2DLqG6Q9jaRWGw7qM0v.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mrs. Madison","credit_id":"62f68fc6c3bffe007a730afe","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1383755,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"R.
