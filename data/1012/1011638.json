Drawing upon Daphne du Maurier’s short story The Birds, and its subsequent cinematic adaptation, Bird in Italian is Uccello (re)enacts a theatrical production of the horror-thriller. Working specifically with an account of a never performed theater production of Maurier’s story - one that was meant to be staged at a psychiatric hospital in northern Italy – Wieland's film inverts the original script’s roles: human characters become birds and the bird protagonists become humans.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/sVIAzbpDW2aF70hvztpaO3ywbR4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bird in Italian is Uccello","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2265858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gernot Wieland","original_name":"Gernot Wieland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f58a411f748b008488e0f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1127,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sVIAzbpDW2aF70hvztpaO3ywbR4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: https://www.fluentum.org/en/collection/bird_in_italian_is_uccello/ (BIENALSUR)","release_date":"2021-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
