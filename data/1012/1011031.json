The family has inhabited the region for generations, but their living and work conditions largely remain those of nomadic subalterns. Their encounters with the political institutions of French and European society are primarily with the police and penal system. Without access to the privileges of so-called normal citizenship, their everyday life is necessarily marked by a continuous invention of the forms of communal existence.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/veE6T26JLxlseSV2ofYtT5FA0pn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dikhav - Les bords du fleuve","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3664730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mathieu Pernot","original_name":"Mathieu Pernot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62fa3fdd6e938a007a3ba697","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt17037792","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.759,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/veE6T26JLxlseSV2ofYtT5FA0pn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1139}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
