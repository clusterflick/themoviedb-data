At first, Allen refuses to believe the stories, but gradually he becomes suspicious. One night, the doctor hears a noise in Madelyn's room, and when he rushes in, he is shot in the arm. The young man jumping from Madelyn's balcony resembles Leonard, and the doctor, deeply hurt, accuses his wife of infidelity. Madelyn is on the verge of killing herself when a secret service agent appears, reporting that the German spy who attempted to steal secret documents from the doctor's home the night before had been apprehended.","popularity":0.1412,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":52129,"logo_path":null,"name":"M.H.
