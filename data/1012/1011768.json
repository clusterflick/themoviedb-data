Once a haven for the magical, the odd, the artistic and the ostricised, Annwn is slowly becoming a petri dish for hateful rhetoric, overseen by the ominous mayor, Gerallt Hopkins.  The story follows Ann, a talented young healing witch who dreams of using her gifts to help others. However, in this divided town, her idealism faces more and more obstacles in the form of mayor Gerallt Hopkins and his police goons. With her sister Cathryn and coven mother Tangrwst on her side, can Ann defy the odds against prejudice?","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":"/b7Vr9Bs5JRLv20h04KPI8OMDi4f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":217906,"logo_path":null,"name":"It's My
