Isaac Gruenstein and his infant daughter Miriam are the only members of his family to survive one of Mussak's massacres, and Isaac is exiled to Siberia. Miriam, however, becomes Mussak's ward and is raised by nuns in a convent. Eighteen years later Isaac dies in Siberia, but before he does he writes a note to his daughter and gives it to fellow prisoner Rachel Shapiro, who manages to escape and, by chance, finds Miriam. However, circumstances have changed in the past 18 years--and Miriam is now Mussak's mistress.","popularity":0.1252,"poster_path":"/avCfpgxE3QWu3oBQyF0dg5HSxvj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29949,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lubin Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Threads of Destiny","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1524826,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evelyn Nesbit","original_name":"Evelyn Nesbit","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":"/shVrHKKgWf0sdxy6Uea3HZZZTS6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Miriam Gruenstein","credit_id":"62f53177c3bffe00828dcde9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Siegel","original_name":"Bernard Siegel","popularity":0.0703,"profile_path":"/hxmgLdeASF62jTlkKf3EjOjb0hZ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Isaac Gruenstein","credit_id":"62f531895b2f47007ffc1212","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3455219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Risser","original_name":"Margaret Risser","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/oBRpbimQrHD43hza2gfoHImuSJl.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Rachel Shapiro","credit_id":"62f531bdf9183a007d96bb23","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1391871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph W.
