Exclusive Mekas interview by the poet Sparrow. The legendary poet-film critic and film diarist waxes philosophical in rare extended setting exhibiting his transcendental poetic humor. Jonas attacks the crass world of TV advertising and sell-out commercial filmmakers. Contributes zen anecdotes and filmmaking advice. Choice clips include Mekas' Film Diaries with deceivingly formalist amateur \"home movie\" style, but in small bursts of expression in a quick collage. Footage from Jonas' homeland as well as clips of famed pop figures John Lennon, Yoko Ono and Tiny Tim.","popularity":0.0848,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":109058,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anthology Film Archives","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Interview and Reading: Jonas Mekas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3659259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sparrow","original_name":"Sparrow","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself (Interviewer)","credit_id":"62f47ff1b39e35007b08fde7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092208,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonas Mekas","original_name":"Jonas Mekas","popularity":0.4058,"profile_path":"/8Vg9wa4dzsYRB2DsaJp9Db7lvuT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"62f47ffc813cb600923bb5a3","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3659262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mitch Corber","original_name":"Mitch Corber","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f48089b39e350080fb6283","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3659262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mitch Corber","original_name":"Mitch Corber","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f480ad5b2f47007a769731","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4434,"name":"interview"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
