During one of the modeling sessions, however, Jules tries to seduce her, and Effie is saved only when Al Tournay, a visitor to the studio, fights off the sculptor. Later, when Jules' latest nude statue looks just like Effie, who really only posed for the head, an outraged principal expels her. Effie then begins a romance with Al, and when they get married, Effie's mother takes the wedding as just one more sign of her daughter's impulsiveness. Mrs. Marchand soon finds out, however, that her new son-in-law is the man she had chosen for Effie long before, and so mother and daughter are quickly reconciled.","popularity":0.1559,"poster_path":"/uKhSTKSUQqgVvzQRPjxOkW52yFv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1916-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mischief Maker","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2388275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"June Caprice","original_name":"June Caprice","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/86le24kmVzD6IJGvovQxo4oV9fz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Effie Marchand","credit_id":"62f6c00d5b2f47007ffcc0a3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1387987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Benham","original_name":"Harry Benham","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/eMuZofkdtw44bbjxbbHF3zQCC8R.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Al Tourney","credit_id":"62f6c01cf9183a007a50753b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3301764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Reinhardt","original_name":"John Reinhardt","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/2SNGdGjr5OaYCTlTyT7mPFixaTC.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jules Gerard","credit_id":"62f6c0322790bf007d5bb7af","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1373144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Fielding","original_name":"Margaret Fielding","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"May Muprey","credit_id":"62f6c3e9498bc2007c549de8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":992884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inez Marcel","original_name":"Inez Marcel","popularity":0.0632,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Madame Briand","credit_id":"631e98cf0102c9007e400365","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3661663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Minnie Milne","original_name":"Minnie Milne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Effie's Sister","credit_id":"62f6c6794d0e8d007a986258","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1794923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Brooke","original_name":"Tom Brooke","popularity":0.1144,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Henry Tourney","credit_id":"62f6c68f498bc20084fa3cbb","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2363534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nellie Slattery","original_name":"Nellie Slattery","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Mrs. Marchand","credit_id":"62f6c6a05b2f47007ffcc248","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1058272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John G.
