She is further piqued by the introduction into their home of a man whose presence is unexplained, but who is really a Secret Service operative guarding the invention. The Government has asked that the wife be kept in ignorance. In this frame of mind the wife lends a ready ear to Aachen, who suggests that the husband be taught a lesson by the abstraction of this all-absorbing formula. Through this means he gets the formula, but in the end the Government gathers him in, and the only permanent result is a needed lesson to the innocent little traitor.","popularity":0.1031,"poster_path":"/5KR2E3zY2AYegP0j1DvBoHZJMXl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90605,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mutual Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Treason","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1816346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edna Goodrich","original_name":"Edna Goodrich","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/plr4o4B9s9Ae1rrwLwDmDKNahjx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Wife","credit_id":"62f53e40d2f5b50085af0e6c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1040010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Howard Hill","original_name":"Howard Hill","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/2esvXOcPHH6RJ3vR2OlpO60Pagl.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Husband","credit_id":"62f53e53ecbde900827076ce","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3659955,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mildred Clair","original_name":"Mildred Clair","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Their Child","credit_id":"62f53e8f0b5fd6007c52eb40","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3137625,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarence Heritage","original_name":"Clarence Heritage","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Major McClintock","credit_id":"62f53e9f5b2f47007a76d790","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119542,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stuart Holmes","original_name":"Stuart Holmes","popularity":0.1316,"profile_path":"/s22P75fI3Mt5D8TbNTIEnSuSQIX.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Anton Tell / Herr McGraff Von Aachen","credit_id":"62f53eaf594c940082d07f6e","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1153824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Burton L.
