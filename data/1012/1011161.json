Furious over her abrupt departure, Staley shows up at Carline's, and a jealous fight with Hal ensues in which Staley is shot and killed with Carline's gun. After Hal confesses to the deed, Stephen quietly sends him off to Spain. One year later, Stephen announces his engagement to Marion Hayward, the daughter of the district attorney, who is pressing charges against James Reed, a corrupt politician and Carline's new husband. To save Reed, Carline threatens Stephen with exposure, but he refuses to bend to her demands. Just days before Carline is to reveal her story about Staley, Hal appears and confesses to Hayward that Carline is the true killer.","popularity":0.1492,"poster_path":"/6ZHMPHIibLHeihP4rHNnaV204tL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Transgression","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1358772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Earle Williams","original_name":"Earle Williams","popularity":0.109,"profile_path":"/h8NOjETlZvKzVeRp5uAalEoPOu3.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Stephen Page","credit_id":"62f4203e6f31af007d658897","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3195180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billie Billings","original_name":"Billie Billings","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Carline Shrefton","credit_id":"62f4204e1f748b0084886e27","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1475051,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Webster Campbell","original_name":"Webster Campbell","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/vbWzo3T7QE10QxvRiotaYcidjbB.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Hal Page","credit_id":"62f42060594c940082d01d15","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edwards Davis","original_name":"Edwards Davis","popularity":0.1152,"profile_path":"/tZwEJcv0w7ruzWPYkw4XGJcdthX.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Kent Hayward","credit_id":"62f420716f31af007a3f9d2e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1387034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Maurice","original_name":"Mary Maurice","popularity":0.0727,"profile_path":"/rljSgfrSJetffMW7ZNhjQVmcjcg.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mrs. Page","credit_id":"62f42082880c92007af04f6f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1054643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corinne Griffith","original_name":"Corinne Griffith","popularity":0.1424,"profile_path":"/aBcI7FfEVDDlxPMnxOoX8bmozL.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Marion Hayward","credit_id":"62f42095813cb6007b35218b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1421771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denton Vane","original_name":"Denton Vane","popularity":0.092,"profile_path":"/mOnA1U5PlLUk4HhrKwcE8NcIwcS.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Burt Staley","credit_id":"62f420effea6e3009135d96f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3658944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Ellis","original_name":"Jack Ellis","popularity":0.1116,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"James Reed","credit_id":"62f4210e1f748b008116f712","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Scardon","original_name":"Paul Scardon","popularity":0.0574,"profile_path":"/oG3lLUua8hXZfblwRAJnA5NIesO.jpg","credit_id":"62f41ff738469a007df8fbb1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1100017,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"J.
