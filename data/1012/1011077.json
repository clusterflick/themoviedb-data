After Charles goes to Egypt, his sister Gertrude and her sweetheart Stephen Hartley, an American consulate attach√©, take refuge from a storm in a deserted tower. Frightened, Gertrude yields to Stephen's advances. Although he intends to marry Gertrude, Stephen suddenly is called to deliver supplies to starving women and children in Russia. Marion takes the pregnant Gertrude away to have her child, and notifies Stephen, who, because he is shot during Bolshevik rioting, returns too late to marry Gertrude, who dies after childbirth. To honor Gertrude's dying request, and to provide Charles with a much desired child, Marion telegraphs Charles that the baby is theirs.","popularity":0.1846,"poster_path":"/3r8whrCCroS1eHdst3oKFpYCErY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1919-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A tale of two women, the strong and the weak, and of exalted self-sacrifice in high life.","title":"The Splendid Sin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1363821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madlaine Traverse","original_name":"Madlaine Traverse","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":"/eGR2FJeaw18tzne6hXiLRMKVRVX.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lady Marion Chatham","credit_id":"62f3fddda242320082f9467c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Clary","original_name":"Charles Clary","popularity":0.2506,"profile_path":"/nAEqw3M130Wco0N1g0IVFWFvUE6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sir Charles Chatham","credit_id":"62f3fdeeb39e350080fb3cce","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1364116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Calhoun","original_name":"Jean Calhoun","popularity":0.0784,"profile_path":"/1JFbBPw1P74IEKjGtr3Q9U2PMSz.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Gertrude","credit_id":"62f3fe06594c94007aa63b02","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wheeler Oakman","original_name":"Wheeler Oakman","popularity":0.088,"profile_path":"/4F4BCjUnk4h8P2QLRaKhE46OJSC.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Stephen Hartley","credit_id":"62f3fe165b2f4700827236d6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1374289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elinor Hancock","original_name":"Elinor Hancock","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"The Dowager Lady St. Aubrey","credit_id":"62f3fe31594c940082d0175c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1042290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Hackathorne","original_name":"George Hackathorne","popularity":0.1381,"profile_path":"/asTjA8gIhfCcVNVvLPwiVcqTnJG.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"The Honorable George Granville","credit_id":"62f3fe4438469a007ad05223","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1405534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edwin B.
