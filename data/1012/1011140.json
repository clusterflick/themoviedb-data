During the reception, Wynne is summoned to Washington where he learns that the treaty has been stolen and is being held for $15,000,000 ransom. Discovering that one of the thieves is an Italian named Farnelli, Wynne enlists the aid of his fianc√©e, Irene Mitchell, in apprehending the thief. Irene meets the Italian who offers to accompany her to New York. En route, Wynne overtakes them, chloroforms Farnelli and rips off his disguise to reveal Prince Zarl. Zarl then admits that he has stolen the treaty in order to cover his gambling debts.","popularity":0.3197,"poster_path":"/4ECf4YBLbvp7o4mBqVCfqMx1pzi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Stolen Treaty","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1358772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Earle Williams","original_name":"Earle Williams","popularity":0.109,"profile_path":"/h8NOjETlZvKzVeRp5uAalEoPOu3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Geoffrey Wynne","credit_id":"62f4175e813cb600923b9527","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1421771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denton Vane","original_name":"Denton Vane","popularity":0.092,"profile_path":"/mOnA1U5PlLUk4HhrKwcE8NcIwcS.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Prince Zarl","credit_id":"62f4176d813cb6007b351fb3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Siegel","original_name":"Bernard Siegel","popularity":0.0703,"profile_path":"/hxmgLdeASF62jTlkKf3EjOjb0hZ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Riddle","credit_id":"62f4177eb39e350080fb410a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1207223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Gaillard","original_name":"Robert Gaillard","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/m5QWpQiBXRETL3ujyamQdykNkhh.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Secretary of State","credit_id":"62f4178e5b2f47007a7678cd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1054643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corinne Griffith","original_name":"Corinne Griffith","popularity":0.1424,"profile_path":"/aBcI7FfEVDDlxPMnxOoX8bmozL.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Irene Mitchell","credit_id":"62f417a1fea6e3007d07eb34","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3195180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billie Billings","original_name":"Billie Billings","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Mrs. Leonori","credit_id":"62f417b2a242320082f94b39","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3658944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Ellis","original_name":"Jack Ellis","popularity":0.1116,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"McMahon","credit_id":"62f418191f748b007cca030a","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1290162,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Helmer Walton Bergman","original_name":"Helmer Walton Bergman","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f417291f748b007cca02d8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2306759,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Thomas Edgelow","original_name":"Thomas Edgelow","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f4174bb39e35008f763ede","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Scardon","original_name":"Paul Scardon","popularity":0.0574,"profile_path":"/oG3lLUua8hXZfblwRAJnA5NIesO.jpg","credit_id":"62f416f0c5ada5008ac53c19","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0008631","wikidata_id":"Q21183929","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7UIwElDGIJIvx4d8nXoR9geQlRP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1196,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4ECf4YBLbvp7o4mBqVCfqMx1pzi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":797}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":282758,"name":"spies"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1917-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
