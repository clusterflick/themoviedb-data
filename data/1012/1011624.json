While filming the final section in Paris, the camera finally gave out after being rewound dozens of times, leaving the map incomplete. The project was postponed until the artist could return, but going over the footage in 2021 it became clear that they shared a period in time that couldn't be revisited.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/meN0AUSsec2yVmjkceyh9PdCLce.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Cities Winter '19","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3660316,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Connor Kammerer","original_name":"Connor Kammerer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f585b27a97ab007e0ffe90","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/meN0AUSsec2yVmjkceyh9PdCLce.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
