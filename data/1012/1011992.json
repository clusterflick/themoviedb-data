In her travels, she sees a plane crash to earth and rushes to assist its pilot, John Barker. The two fall in love and are married. In the midst of their honeymoon, war breaks out and John is called to his post, leaving Ruth alone with only the servants to protect her. In John's absence, the enemy invades the countryside, commandeers the Barker house and imprisons Ruth in her room. Meanwhile, John takes leave to search for his wife. Managing to get through the enemy line, he arrives just as Ruth, enraged at the action of the invaders, dynamites the cellar of the house. As the building explodes, Ruth and John escape in his plane.","popularity":0.2985,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":176030,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thanhouser Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A great 5 part drama showing what might happen to our homes and women if this city were captured by an enemy.","title":"War and the Woman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1171440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence La Badie","original_name":"Florence La Badie","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/7vb4YEwmvKQoYgTtq4UvbzvOaME.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ruth Norton--Braun's Stepdaughter","credit_id":"62f6b9e69974ee007ea457a6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157254,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ernest C.
