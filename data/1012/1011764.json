After reading newspaper stories about other stars marrying into royalty, she demands that Eddie \"promote me a husband with a title within 24 hours\". With the dubious assistance of reporter Don Barclay and photographer Billy Nelson he talks the first man with a British accent that he meets into marrying Gloria, fooling her into believing he is a Duke. The trouble is that the man is a big fan of Gloria the movie star and is madly in love with her, so after the wedding, when she finds out the truth, her new husband refuses to divorce her. A wild free-for-all fight ensues in the hotel. In typical Hal Roach comedy fashion, numerous innocent bystanders are pulled into the action.","popularity":0.3089,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":2159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hal Roach Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1934-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Duke for a Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanette Loff","original_name":"Jeanette Loff","popularity":0.071,"profile_path":"/6kfkmWKRnKtvsCjLynb6nHpnB1k.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Gloria Blossom","credit_id":"62f60094b39e350080fbe4c0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Foy Jr.","original_name":"Eddie Foy Jr.","popularity":0.2084,"profile_path":"/iceOurUhUhToPXhjWBLv5rwZdMB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Edward","credit_id":"62f600aa498bc20084f9f7be","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Barclay","original_name":"Don Barclay","popularity":0.1223,"profile_path":"/jVKPE16JHrMa5H5VDyG4z05rK5M.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Joe Morgan","credit_id":"62f600bc1f748b0084890ce4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Nelson","original_name":"Billy Nelson","popularity":0.1396,"profile_path":"/cIwqyZX89h3LZ94oemmbvTuFX0o.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Billy","credit_id":"62f600cffea6e3007d0888b8","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Parrott","original_name":"James Parrott","popularity":0.3597,"profile_path":"/od32ZGilfKocacyL4EBKdcqkaL4.jpg","credit_id":"62f60030498bc20084f9f794","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0025074","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1934-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
