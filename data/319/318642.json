From an outpost on the Greek-Albanian border, a military truck unexpectedly comes under fire by Italian tanks. Petros, the only one who manages to escape death or captivity, saves a village girl, Maria. However, the Greeks manage to recapture the machine-gun nest, setting free the soldiers who had been pinned down. The platoon in question puts up a hard fight against the Italian invaders, while, at the same time, the Greek army is preparing for a counter-attack, which doesn't take long to happen. Right after, the Italians are forced to fall back; Northern Epirus is recaptured, and the army of the Badoglio is repulsed from the Adriatic.","popularity":0.1966,"poster_path":"/abNuJQYKrcES6K8OcyB3LWLuKf2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"They were determined to fight to the last man like heroes.","title":"Hero Bunker","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Hero Bunker","type":"English Title (Home Video)"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Aera!
