It doesn't help that he works as a nightwatchman, and that she has left a satisfying job teaching music to children to follow him, and is now out of work. During his endless nocturnal rounds with his lively colleague, Tom, Zeno meet a pretty Romanian waitress, Ela, and begins a flirtation that eventually leads to a passionate kiss. As expected, Zeno and Rossana's relationship deteriorates even further, and not even the news that Rossana is expecting their child can help them reconnect.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'ultima foglia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1935834","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
