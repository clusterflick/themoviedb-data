In the late sixties the two women rebelled against middle class society as if they gave vent to a new kind of art. They became active in the underground communist party KPD and showed a heart-felt interest in the colour red, the aesthetics of the revolution. Soon, though, the twins quit their experiments in Germany. They left their husbands and went to Rome, where they met the fabulously wealthy Paul Getty III, and soon things got really out of hand.","popularity":0.6839,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":2407,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kick Film Produktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1991-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SnowwhiteRosered","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1377801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jutta Winkelmann","original_name":"Jutta Winkelmann","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54baa656c3a3686c6f006497","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1414674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gisela Getty","original_name":"Gisela Getty","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54baa66cc3a3686c6b007d00","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Hopper","original_name":"Dennis Hopper","popularity":1.2061,"profile_path":"/kqyNvLHi5RZGZcZMxl7e6XvoB5U.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54baa6899251414859003bc0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6818,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Werner Herzog","original_name":"Werner Herzog","popularity":0.9989,"profile_path":"/qKlz1oM482Xf0jTPfLiR6qXlLYK.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54baa6aac3a3683eeb001717","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50870,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexander Kluge","original_name":"Alexander Kluge","popularity":0.2615,"profile_path":"/3zC5rpInRtutN29trvMIXJV3cx0.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54baa6b792514148bd003dfe","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrei Konchalovsky","original_name":"Андрей Кончаловский","popularity":0.608,"profile_path":"/wPQmCJ6tirAkfPMg7vNAQUeK0yw.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f88921bd4b9d9003626873c","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1377803,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christa Ritter","original_name":"Christa Ritter","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54baa712c3a3686c6b007d15","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1103699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rainer Langhans","original_name":"Rainer Langhans","popularity":0.1138,"profile_path":"/8Z2DDB5t1XQG9PxldUMiHI2vnRl.jpg","credit_id":"54baa7b5c3a3686c610064ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1103699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rainer Langhans","original_name":"Rainer Langhans","popularity":0.1138,"profile_path":"/8Z2DDB5t1XQG9PxldUMiHI2vnRl.jpg","credit_id":"54baa7ce9251411d770068a7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1377803,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christa Ritter","original_name":"Christa Ritter","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54baa7efc3a368142100374c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2337,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hans Fromm","original_name":"Hans Fromm","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54baa83292514148b0003acb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1103699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rainer Langhans","original_name":"Rainer Langhans","popularity":0.1138,"profile_path":"/8Z2DDB5t1XQG9PxldUMiHI2vnRl.jpg","credit_id":"54baa856c3a36840460018ee","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":49259,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alexander Rupp","original_name":"Alexander Rupp","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54baa887c3a368145e00404d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38812,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ulrich Bassenge","original_name":"Ulrich Bassenge","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54baa8b0c3a3686c61006504","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0102854","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5246,"name":"students' movement"},{"id":1930,"name":"kidnapping"},{"id":14964,"name":"drugs"},{"id":197705,"name":"self-liberation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
