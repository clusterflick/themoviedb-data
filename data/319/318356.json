Terry, a respectable man, works for a man named Jason Wynn. Wynn is a black-market arms dealer, amongst other things (such as the head of certain government organizations, one of which dispatched Al and his team to Vietnam), and is revealed to be the man responsible for the death of Al Simmons due to a disagreement the two had between each other. Jason's actions would also prove dangerous to the lives of Terry, Wanda and their daughter as well. Realizing that he is no longer the man in Wanda's life, Al swears to protect her and her new family.","popularity":1.4992,"poster_path":"/qY5l48eljMFATZJ3F0bcy2GGVZC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3268,"logo_path":"/tuomPhY2UtuPTqqFnKMVHvSb724.png","name":"HBO","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3464,"logo_path":"/9k0nr75nwnNeT2MHerf1OXJN0hj.png","name":"Madhouse","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":144,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Todd McFarlane's Spawn 2","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":22,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith David","original_name":"Keith David","popularity":1.9636,"profile_path":"/jJLJuR7FNHYL1fB5igjj7IXzOel.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Al Simmons / Spawn (voice)","credit_id":"54d6bc12c3a3683ba0003e1e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Nicolosi","original_name":"Michael Nicolosi","popularity":0.2682,"profile_path":"/s3jxEzrq7RFWirtdvycXLAuNN3g.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Clown (voice)","credit_id":"54d6bc76c3a3683ba0003e49","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Dysart","original_name":"Richard Dysart","popularity":0.5725,"profile_path":"/yQOaZexN3YbqGWOguu2VrjsvX2G.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Cogliostro (voice(","credit_id":"54d7d06392514153b5003021","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":95200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominique Jennings","original_name":"Dominique Jennings","popularity":0.3225,"profile_path":"/gQvFevYR8dyH0TTOnOAV8tOMSEO.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Wanda Blake (voice)","credit_id":"54d7d0779251417160006856","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Beach","original_name":"Michael Beach","popularity":1.5015,"profile_path":"/7gCBCpK2OSzuUWk5iTZds9NjqkF.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Terry Fitzgerald (voice)","credit_id":"54d7d2099251413388003709","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Rafter Lee","original_name":"John Rafter Lee","popularity":0.1272,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Jason Wynn (voice)","credit_id":"54d7d26dc3a3683b8900647f","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1217663,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Shirley","original_name":"John Shirley","popularity":0.1564,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638468cfb3316b007f3c6683","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3805605,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rebekah Bradford Leekley","original_name":"Rebekah Bradford Leekley","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63846848229ae2158116c0b2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":188269,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Leekley","original_name":"John Leekley","popularity":0.1094,"profile_path":"/1OCl1T6oNA2hKSBgXxhFEsQxPtd.jpg","credit_id":"63846894fb834600cb20d508","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1844659,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Thomas A.
