He waited until sins reach to the heavens. Now, He has rise up. He has called a woman from the far east to proclaim His message to the inhabitants of the earth. That He may do His awesome work as in the past, His unusual act, and bring it to pass that all people may know He is God of yesterday, today and forever. This movie was inspired by the Holy Spirit. Watch it with an open heart. It will challenge all Christian religions to carefully research what they have been teaching to the people in the church. It will give them an overview to what God is about to do in the near future to the people in all religions and in the world. But to the children of God, the sheep and the chosen ones, it will encourage them to read the Holy Bible and seek for the truth.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mount Zion, God' Second Deliverance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
