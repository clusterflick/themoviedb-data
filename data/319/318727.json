It depicts the devastating consequences of water scarcity exacerbated by pollution. The film follows a group of farmers who saw their orchards destroyed by water pollution, and their one-sided struggle against a major corporation and an unsympathetic local government to gain compensation. Through the stories of the individual villagers and the predictions of local experts, we witness a paradise lost to economic progress, and the consequences of doing too little, too late.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When the Last Tree Dies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3113216","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
