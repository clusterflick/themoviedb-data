A blonde teenage girl, knowing she must change her life, leaves her well-appointed house and flagrantly gives herself over to this tolerant city, saying \"yes\" to everything provocative it offers her. Only the music tethers her body and spirit together, even as she reaches for redemption through a bold, delicious, and resplendent self-destruction.","popularity":0.0613,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Liveforever","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1416330,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Moreno","original_name":"Carlos Moreno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54bedbe492514136350082ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
