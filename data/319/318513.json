Revealing the unknown stars and lost masterpieces, he brings to life the pioneering techniques and optical inventiveness of the virtuosos who mastered a new art form. With a playful eye and comic sense of timing, Merton combines the role of presenter and director to recreate the weird and wonderful world that is early European cinema in a series of cinematic experiments of his own.","popularity":0.2629,"poster_path":"/hZtjPFlPk0J1s3H0FPtfnzfYg3S.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31272,"logo_path":"/kJU4FbsNy58061t5313VKpfksh5.png","name":"BBC Bristol Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2010-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paul Merton's Weird and Wonderful World of Early Cinema","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Merton","original_name":"Paul Merton","popularity":0.1182,"profile_path":"/s9YSFw66HOjS4mnWwItSWgl1gCx.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59bc6894925141356d002f02","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1083253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Brand","original_name":"Neil Brand","popularity":0.0915,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d924fdbcee2f6001179416e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2422297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suki Webster","original_name":"Suki Webster","popularity":0.1248,"profile_path":"/d65sPEPAyQltaq7CjQVMJ2aoXOr.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5d924fe90f5265001ac39590","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serge Bromberg","original_name":"Serge Bromberg","popularity":0.1073,"profile_path":"/aaeELuv3jwGq2NYxdhZ58YnjRAe.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d924ffac8f3c40013d4347a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2422298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suzie Plumb","original_name":"Suzie Plumb","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5d925005cee2f6002a7940f1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1531273,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maud Linder","original_name":"Maud Linder","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5d925013cee2f6001a793933","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Merton","original_name":"Paul Merton","popularity":0.1182,"profile_path":"/s9YSFw66HOjS4mnWwItSWgl1gCx.jpg","credit_id":"5d9250488ac3d0002a491ac2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Merton","original_name":"Paul Merton","popularity":0.1182,"profile_path":"/s9YSFw66HOjS4mnWwItSWgl1gCx.jpg","credit_id":"5d92504e8ac3d0002a491ac9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2422297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suki Webster","original_name":"Suki Webster","popularity":0.1248,"profile_path":"/d65sPEPAyQltaq7CjQVMJ2aoXOr.jpg","credit_id":"5d92507c8ac3d00022490b96","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1623097,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kate Broome","original_name":"Kate Broome","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d92508d0f52650012c38415","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1083253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Brand","original_name":"Neil Brand","popularity":0.0915,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d9250aaf548360023672a36","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2347001,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Steve Scales","original_name":"Steve Scales","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d9250be0f5265001ac397e3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1632585","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hZtjPFlPk0J1s3H0FPtfnzfYg3S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eJrPUbZe8Zg4ItrTIdszH52tZKY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1331}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
