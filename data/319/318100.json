Isolated by her obsessions, she functions in a reality of her own creation. She is on the verge of a scientific breakthrough, grafting animal senses to her brain to regain the profundity of her near-death experience. Just when Dr. Myes is poised to succeed, she loses everything and must climb back up from the bottom using unconventional means. This hybrid of animation, songs, and live-action narrative follows the research of Dr. Sheri Myes and her attempts to expand human consciousness.","popularity":0.4182,"poster_path":"/7nT1Md8FfDtmHA4ntUmzgm9AfdN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Strange Eyes of Dr. Myes","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":536271,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michole Briana White","original_name":"Michole Briana White","popularity":0.3134,"profile_path":"/4ooXO8EO9hJdwHVaYwY2eDIzUo4.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dr. Sheri Myes","credit_id":"60de159a5690b5005e556b8d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":971273,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Prediger","original_name":"Jennifer Prediger","popularity":0.1553,"profile_path":"/kUOodSZVQL5DdIdIrqgAGCp53e7.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Dr. Linda Wiley","credit_id":"60de15a24ca676004616e726","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3142993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Jackson","original_name":"Kevin Jackson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Dr. E.L.
