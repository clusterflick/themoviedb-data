Like Bob Marley in Jamaica, Eugène Mona shaped Martinique’s identity. In the 1970s, after the disillusionment of departmentalization, the barefoot man from Marigot brought a music both rooted in tradition and open to the world. A Creole jazzman, he guided his people through his flute, using humor and satire to critique post-slavery society. But beyond criticism, he sought emancipation, advocating a return to nature and spirituality. Though it cost him fame, his legacy only grew stronger. Mona remains a fighter, a \"radar\" in his own words, whose lyrics still resonate today. This documentary takes you “in Mona’s footsteps,” blending rare testimonies, archival footage, and his music to rediscover Martinique through his vision.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sur les traces de Mona","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
