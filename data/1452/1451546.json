A nod to Jarmusch’s collage-making practice, the photographs have been featured on skate decks in seemingly random sets of threes. Whether their placement seems contrasting or connected is up to the eye of the viewer. The artist himself refers to the process as more dreamlike than logical, with the dark background of each board adding to the mysterious effect.","popularity":0.2144,"poster_path":"/k1FFbMzhFrIlMIB2PevEENcc1Dm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":256933,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Skate Room","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Short Film by Jim Jarmusch, Starring Beatrice Domond","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3081224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beatrice Domond","original_name":"Beatrice Domond","popularity":0.0418,"profile_path":"/4jSGXCHIkCOYebYYBGD73CwFEsa.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67dc3e0d186eca57b2e7bdb6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Jarmusch","original_name":"Jim Jarmusch","popularity":0.5434,"profile_path":"/iMpIrvhoO9SZWhiDkSzaUt9Yd4N.jpg","credit_id":"67dc3e170d339bb7147fc1a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Jarmusch","original_name":"Jim Jarmusch","popularity":0.5434,"profile_path":"/iMpIrvhoO9SZWhiDkSzaUt9Yd4N.jpg","credit_id":"67dc3e215ef4639ebae7b03c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5317417,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Arnaud Duynstee","original_name":"Arnaud Duynstee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dc3e35186eca57b2e7bdc9","department":"Art","job":"Creative Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5317417,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Arnaud Duynstee","original_name":"Arnaud Duynstee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dc3e3f0d339bb7147fc1b7","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5317419,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Benoît Do Quang","original_name":"Benoît Do Quang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dc3e4c5ef4639ebae7b05f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5317419,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Benoît Do Quang","original_name":"Benoît Do Quang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dc3e550d339bb7147fc1c1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5317419,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Benoît Do Quang","original_name":"Benoît Do Quang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dc3e600d339bb7147fc1c6","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2333713,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arielle De Saint Phalle","original_name":"Arielle De Saint Phalle","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/8ZmjVTHbdVDzohduWypDVmpyIzf.jpg","credit_id":"67dc3e6c5ef4639ebae7b08b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xfwWQxNGwgi798lcWV9RJL9OW0W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k1FFbMzhFrIlMIB2PevEENcc1Dm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"A Short Film by Jim Jarmusch, Starring Beatrice Domond","key":"GKTLl91szS4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-03-20T14:45:19.000Z","id":"67de42e5051cba9066f57af2"}]}}}
