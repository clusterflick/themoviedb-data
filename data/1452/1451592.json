Characters dissolve; the viewer becomes the subject, imprinting their own displacement onto the screen. Spaces are precise yet unfamiliar, grounding the ethereal in the tangible. The work redefines the screen as a mirror, not a windowâ€”a site of introspection, transformation, and emotional reckoning. A provocation to feel, not just watch.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/vCzcjQPVnjWcDnG7O5S7jWuoJGt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"TTR Video Sampler","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5317592,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Tteo Zavaglia","original_name":"Tteo Zavaglia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dc58acdb76d0433cf2c4a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":918,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vCzcjQPVnjWcDnG7O5S7jWuoJGt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":612}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
