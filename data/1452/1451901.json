Stacey Dooley meets four women who have reported being raped by someone they know - and follows their emotional journey as they fight to be believed in a system under immense strain.  When Stacey first meets Jessie, Emma and Becca in 2022, their cases have been taken up by the Crown Prosecution Service, but they are all playing a waiting game, with delays stretching from months into years. As they navigate barrister strikes, postponed trials and long waits for their day in court, Stacey witnesses first-hand the impact this has on their lives and their loved ones around them.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stacey Dooley: Rape on Trial","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36175455","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
