These are encounters that leave deep scars - on the body and on the soul. Perpetrator and victim remain connected to each other as if by an invisible rope, welded together by the (monstrosity of the) crime. Despite this bond, perpetrators and victims often only meet in the courtroom. One in the dock, the other as plaintiff or in the witness chair.","popularity":0.0988,"poster_path":"/8jVlZ6xmH9k8IrVlU1yafphpdx9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mediation – Chance für Opfer und Täter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3074625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"François Kohler","original_name":"François Kohler","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dc253e9f358f4a137fb03f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7619,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Xavier Grin","original_name":"Xavier Grin","popularity":0.0573,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dc254a9f358f4a137fb043","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/jXiYeba9y1UeNvKAz3QqLTlv8h5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7QSDkI9jyWmuZNC7ldnsKmXzVkz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1763,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/8jVlZ6xmH9k8IrVlU1yafphpdx9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1175}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"ARTE","release_date":"2020-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
