The chairman of the collective farm asks the loaders to unload them first, due to the need to carry out work in the countryside on time. The loaders demand additional pay. Angered by the behavior of their senior comrades, the Komsomol members, led by Beso, unload the machinery themselves. After that, the old loader, Sergo, becomes angry with Beso. His daughter Kato marries Beso against her father's will. But Beso, like Sergo, forbids Kato from getting involved in public life. He only wants his wife as a domestic servant. Kato returns to his father with his son. Meanwhile, there are changes at the port. Due to mechanization, the loaders' work is significantly lighter. Sergo reconciles with Beso. The young people also reconcile. Kato starts working at a public canteen.","popularity":0.0585,"poster_path":"/lydK2aXdIlFNHTJ9RVP9uTTUrhd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":186508,"logo_path":"/dONUQvMFW5X8DCw6nX9Dk26TQwF.png","name":"Georgia-Film","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"}],"release_date":"1930-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"გაყრა","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2536063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kirile Macharadze","original_name":"Kirile Macharadze","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"სერგო","credit_id":"67db36f813d4b1aed4e9d556","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2536064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleksandra Toidze","original_name":"Aleksandra Toidze","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"კატო","credit_id":"67db370b13d4b1aed4e9d578","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1408123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleqsandre Jaliashvili","original_name":"ალექსანდრე ჯალიაშვილი","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"ბესო","credit_id":"67db3722186eca57b2e7874f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2278231,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giorgi Makarov","original_name":"Giorgi Makarov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67db366d08749efe34e78551","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1303044,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Valerian Sidamon-Eristavi","original_name":"ვალერიან სიდამონ-ერისტავი","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67db3693fec58aa3c5e9d848","department":"Art","job":"Painter"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2273480,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lado Gudiashvili","original_name":"Lado Gudiashvili","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67db36a3186eca57b2e78703","department":"Art","job":"Painter"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1304932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Piotr Morskoy","original_name":"Piotr Morskoy","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/bqMyx1bACoaB0ZDrR3cQeqXfEMd.jpg","credit_id":"67db36c30d339bb7147f7e89","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1408130,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Anton Polikevich","original_name":"ანტონ პოლიკევიჩი","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67db36df186eca57b2e78727","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lydK2aXdIlFNHTJ9RVP9uTTUrhd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1930-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
