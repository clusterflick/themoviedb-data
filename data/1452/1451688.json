Sat in the middle is the ancient market town of Leominster, where people have been growing, picking, eating, stealing, throwing, pressing, cooking, and honouring apples for many generations. This heritage film brings together a wide-ranging and eccentric cast of local people – farmers, Travellers, former apple-pickers, clergymen, wassailers, cider makers, fruit sellers – to explore the deep relationship between the people of this area and its historic crop. Part portrait of a fading way of life, part celebration of how a living culture continues to manifest itself, the film raises deep questions about human nature. Expect games, pies, dancing, petty crime, and varieties of apple beyond your most delirious dreams. Prepare to honour the apple.  This film was made possible with the support of the UK's National Lottery Heritage Fund, Leominster Town Council and Leominster Cultural Consortium.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/55xwVbe1ZqAG4K54hx9DEopvlnc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":256985,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moving House Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Prepare to honour the apple","title":"Welcome to the Orchard of England","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2437316,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Norris","original_name":"Louis Norris","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dc8c7b35089114526ba3a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5318043,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hilary Lyon","original_name":"Hilary Lyon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dc8c8e843a9503366ba39f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3803980,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Ben-Shaul","original_name":"Jonathan Ben-Shaul","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dc8c9ec505f52e35f2c9c6","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3803980,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Ben-Shaul","original_name":"Jonathan Ben-Shaul","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dc8cb1c505f52e35f2c9d6","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3803980,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Ben-Shaul","original_name":"Jonathan Ben-Shaul","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dc8cbdc505f52e35f2c9e9","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2437316,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Norris","original_name":"Louis Norris","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dc8cc835089114526ba3ba","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2437316,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Norris","original_name":"Louis Norris","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dc8cd7c20fb5a418af2d3b","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2437316,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Norris","original_name":"Louis Norris","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dc8ce8c505f52e35f2c9fb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5318043,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hilary Lyon","original_name":"Hilary Lyon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dc8cffc505f52e35f2ca04","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35864560","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2829,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/55xwVbe1ZqAG4K54hx9DEopvlnc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Welcome to the Orchard of England | Official Trailer","key":"giLVJsVxaR0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-02-08T09:00:47.000Z","id":"67dc8c44b70f603e21af2d7a"}]}}}
