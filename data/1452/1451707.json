We're on a journey with Douglas Adams - diving into the broad questions of life, the universe and everything at a time when we are all asking questions of ourselves and our place on Earth - and our fear of destroying it. Campaigning for endangered species and the coming storm of climate change, he was years ahead of his time.  Optimistic about the infinite possibilities that computers will bring, obsessing with the art of writing, while exploring parallel dimensions and artificial intelligence, his philosophy and ideas are meaningful, and visionary.","popularity":0.6497,"poster_path":"/dcxN31HGa1FgfvXiQay7knNI9Ks.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117663,"logo_path":"/41ff40pak0KpRzSBf29WLlg1Xn9.png","name":"Bohemia
