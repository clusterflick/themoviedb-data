The numerous characterisations and interpretations add an aura of mystery to the opera but demonstrate above all that it is a unique work of musical theatre that expresses the hope for a humane future with justice and liberty for all.  The stage direction is in the hands of the Ukrainian director Andriy Zholdak. His visual imagery, replete with symbols, is reminiscent of great film directors such as Andrei Tarkovsky and Ingmar Bergman. Using a distinctive style, Zholdak explores the deeper layers of the universal human drama of Fidelio. These layers can sometimes be difficult to follow.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":"/kwLC6KK0Q4yenYGKo1SD4Awo7T1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2024-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":155,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fidelio - Dutch National Opera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2148226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacquelyn Wagner","original_name":"Jacquelyn Wagner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Leonore","credit_id":"67dd23250416875adc697ef8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5318789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Kurmanbayev","original_name":"Mark Kurmanbayev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Don Fernando","credit_id":"67dd233fadf21a1668f548a3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Cutler","original_name":"Eric Cutler","popularity":0.1401,"profile_path":"/mbZH5eaMReeB4SoOuP97WPVyKrX.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Florestan","credit_id":"67dd2352adf21a1668f548af","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1658539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Creswell","original_name":"James Creswell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Rocco","credit_id":"67dd2368adf21a1668f548bc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5318791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicholas Brownlee","original_name":"Nicholas Brownlee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Don Pizarro","credit_id":"67dd237f0416875adc697f37","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3855296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna El-Khashem","original_name":"Anna El-Khashem","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Marzelline","credit_id":"67dd23960416875adc697f3f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3722868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linard Vrielink","original_name":"Linard Vrielink","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Jaquino","credit_id":"67dd23afc70acdd9df697e5c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5318792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefan Kennedy","original_name":"Stefan Kennedy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Erster Gefangener","credit_id":"67dd23cb29923784937a6486","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3221758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Arink","original_name":"Peter Arink","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Zweiter Gefangener","credit_id":"67dd23e1adf21a1668f548f1","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2522,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ludwig van Beethoven","original_name":"Ludwig van Beethoven","popularity":0.2256,"profile_path":"/bSyMM4Y7qWLKMvDuynPJ3mn3Pup.jpg","credit_id":"67dd22e65f977836ab7a635e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5318787,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andriy Zholdak","original_name":"Andriy Zholdak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dd23015f977836ab7a636f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kwLC6KK0Q4yenYGKo1SD4Awo7T1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
