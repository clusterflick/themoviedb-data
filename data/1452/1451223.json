In 1825 George Stephenson made and drove the first passenger locomotive. In 1925 the London and North Eastern Railway presented a historical parade and tableaux to illustrate the subsequent development of the railways. Debenhams of York were commissioned to record the proceedings, making this film record a candidate for one of the earliest films sponsored by a railway company. This version is complete with its original tints, meaning that for the first time in decades the film can be seen as Debenhams had originally intended.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Official Film of the Railway Centenary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
