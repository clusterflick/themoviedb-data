The boys smuggle him out so he can do their math homework. But the magical machine's programming is faulty and it goes its own way, playing havoc in town. While Max tries to catch the robot, Tüte takes the robot’s place at the exhibition. But he gets in deep trouble, when he can't solve math problems. Luckily Max and the robot return in time and the boys decide it's better to do their own homework in the future.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/vTCfZaZx6bUfsOYC2Bgmg2dIWxJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":602,"logo_path":"/pVsXRFbYVDe5BhsATCAh1rt5F0k.png","name":"DEFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"}],"release_date":"1970-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Robot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1477916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klaus Georgi","original_name":"Klaus Georgi","popularity":0.1391,"profile_path":"/c6KPYFGfqYrAUashgMVFPXGoQ71.jpg","credit_id":"67dd197e051cba9066f54462","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1477916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klaus Georgi","original_name":"Klaus Georgi","popularity":0.1391,"profile_path":"/c6KPYFGfqYrAUashgMVFPXGoQ71.jpg","credit_id":"67dd19fe29923784937a611e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2086862,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hans Schöne","original_name":"Hans Schöne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67dd1a0c29923784937a6126","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3095852","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vTCfZaZx6bUfsOYC2Bgmg2dIWxJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
