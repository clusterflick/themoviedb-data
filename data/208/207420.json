The shady character who was playing the game before him covets the lamp, and tries to steal it. Egghead sees a poster: The sultan is having a contest for his daughter's hand in marriage. With his lamp, Egghead thinks he's a sure bet; he conjures up a magic carpet, and he's off. After a couple bad vaudeville acts, it's Egghead's turn, but in the meantime, the bad guy swapped the lamp for a coffeepot. Egghead is thrown out, then sees the bad guy using the lamp; Egghead breaks in, steals the lamp and the girl, and flies off. But she uses the lamp herself to conjure up a real hunk to replace the nerdy Egghead.","popularity":0.4045,"poster_path":"/iIKw9eAGrCMyOFOj1bmnvEqnwVl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1938-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A-Lad-In Bagdad","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Blanc","original_name":"Mel Blanc","popularity":1.2076,"profile_path":"/8fevv4K06TmHsYom2XfmxgKrTcd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Villain (voice)","credit_id":"6181e90184f249008d432a5a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":564938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cliff Nazarro","original_name":"Cliff Nazarro","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/aC8CWA9B3Dm2w8OJWkXArqfhAFy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Aladdin (voice)","credit_id":"6181e90ea097dc002ab696c0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":146136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernice Hansen","original_name":"Bernice Hansen","popularity":0.0885,"profile_path":"/1T1q0UvWl1xO3pmUbUdDIXz6gvZ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sultan's Daughter (voice)","credit_id":"6181e923e741460084bb2665","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":785866,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cal Howard","original_name":"Cal Howard","popularity":0.1057,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d34c3a368484e1dcbc9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":573539,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Cal Dalton","original_name":"Cal Dalton","popularity":0.0934,"profile_path":"/wwEbwRnK5iB0FidjGx8kPWrsHYd.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d34c3a368484e1dcbc3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0029833","wikidata_id":"Q27703145","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":786,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7I5O8SpCy1dZWpiSzEBu3ud7teH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1397}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iIKw9eAGrCMyOFOj1bmnvEqnwVl.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ceXuHS3kneNM4oO77LGA80BDpMR.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fy","file_path":"/pVKwPObudmxwP5345XkNqszawkS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/yivpCTAmHOzFmAK2p2JrEz62eD2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1938-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
