Billowing puffs of darkness blend with fountains of water streaming in from offscreen to orchestrate a play of primal elements. The beautiful texture of the smoke coupled with the isolation from the source of the fire erases the destructive impact of the event. The camera, lost in the immense dark clouds, produces images for meditation removed from the causes or consequences of the scene. The tiny firemen, seen as distant silhouettes, gaze in awe, helpless before natureâ€™s power.","popularity":0.0393,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1979-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boston Fire","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093719,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Hutton","original_name":"Peter Hutton","popularity":0.0724,"profile_path":"/qWXyXftCSJSaJE6UIeQpLTn8L9g.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d2dc3a368484e1db395","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1829652","wikidata_id":"Q55717225","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2Q0fhJw96r5NawmOXE14FcSuRX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
