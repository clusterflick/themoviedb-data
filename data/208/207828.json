Trixie Friganza performs first a story and then a song. For the story, she wears a wide-brimmed had and a matching diaphanous shawl. She tells of a visit to a friend who has a five-year old son. The mother tells Trixie a tale of stepping out on her husband, and to conceal the story from the boy, spells out key words. By the story's end, mom is in for a surprise and Trixie has a moral for us. Then, the hat and shawl come off, a base fiddle comes out, and Trixie sings us a comic song about her first two husbands.","popularity":0.1504,"poster_path":"/oFpVh80K6fOfGimdtizp9MPbTBf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1929-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Bag o' Tricks","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Trixie Friganza in My Bag o' Trix","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":150637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trixie Friganza","original_name":"Trixie Friganza","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":"/4BDX5PJ9LFpPC02fBn25Nm7qLc0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d3ec3a368484e1de9c3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1021714,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Murray Roth","original_name":"Murray Roth","popularity":0.1049,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bd6ab220e0a2622c803ee03","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0142676","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.683,"height":846,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oFpVh80K6fOfGimdtizp9MPbTBf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":578}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1929-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
