Mooch's big brother Wilbert 'Wilby' is smart, shy and a promising inventor, but hopelessly clumsy when it comes to girls, and is jealous of his slick mate Trey who has no problems. Desperate Wilby resorts to a spell from the ring of Lucrezia Borgia (he accidentally got from dad's museum of curiosities), which magically turns him into Bundles and back at uncontrollable times. This is how he also knows that the diamond on loan in his father's museum is Charlie's next target.","popularity":2.4338,"poster_path":"/rehY2aWyiCeYQ3S4h2rXqg3hRxP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15943,"logo_path":null,"name":"ZM Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":670,"logo_path":"/rRGi5UkwvdOPSfr5Xf42RZUsYgd.png","name":"Walt Disney Television","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Shaggy Dog","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":20,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Begley Jr.","original_name":"Ed Begley Jr.","popularity":1.1174,"profile_path":"/cdS6hZVabhpQ3UdIK0HNvYXj5IM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ron Daniels","credit_id":"52fe4d35c3a368484e1dcd9f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":121566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharon Lawrence","original_name":"Sharon Lawrence","popularity":0.878,"profile_path":"/bLu3mjAJKDq8WE3QfspIvInKGVu.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Beth Daniels","credit_id":"52fe4d35c3a368484e1dcda3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Polito","original_name":"Jon Polito","popularity":0.4079,"profile_path":"/4HjxMy4Ir2dWz7ycX5l3sgxOY4g.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Detective Al","credit_id":"52fe4d35c3a368484e1dcda7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Cromwell","original_name":"James Cromwell","popularity":1.9221,"profile_path":"/vpNQQbM5PtxsYmVm4oh79SGFyUK.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Charlie Mulvihill","credit_id":"52fe4d35c3a368484e1dcdab","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Sisto","original_name":"Jeremy Sisto","popularity":1.2997,"profile_path":"/1XfuASLjBhGOhJ4os7juRJot2we.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Trey Miller","credit_id":"52fe4d35c3a368484e1dcdaf","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67380,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jordan Warkol","original_name":"Jordan Warkol","popularity":0.3056,"profile_path":"/3PKc7upjRt4JmkjlwIgKjDmsL7u.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Moochie Daniels","credit_id":"52fe4d35c3a368484e1dcdb3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":33677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Lassez","original_name":"Sarah Lassez","popularity":0.192,"profile_path":"/nbnKFyYKSCshvuJk2UCPjCG0ovt.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Francesca","credit_id":"52fe4d35c3a368484e1dcdb7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natasha Gregson Wagner","original_name":"Natasha Gregson Wagner","popularity":0.5644,"profile_path":"/4Nq7uccj8RR3Elr1OzLhckRiEJv.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Allison","credit_id":"52fe4d35c3a368484e1dcdbb","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobby Slayton","original_name":"Bobby Slayton","popularity":0.1418,"profile_path":"/crfs2HQBAteBC4xUSY6NrlMCx7.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Coach Evans","credit_id":"623c867d945c20005fb7aa14","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Ducommun","original_name":"Rick Ducommun","popularity":0.363,"profile_path":"/wIZ0OWk13TRtolrbNNX58AK9gJr.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Officer Kelly","credit_id":"623c8683211ce5005c9a1d29","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Pasquesi","original_name":"David Pasquesi","popularity":0.3876,"profile_path":"/oQplec891LMv0wndTtKh1bIS11Z.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Officer Hanson","credit_id":"623c8688d1a8930047986cc0","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Weinger","original_name":"Scott Weinger","popularity":0.5474,"profile_path":"/wOIqHtaYQ2BwzAJsRcnVJCC0TGz.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Wilby Daniels","credit_id":"52fe4d35c3a368484e1dcdc5","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1219827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Dugan","original_name":"Charles Dugan","popularity":0.1069,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Drunk in Cell","credit_id":"623c869c945c20009023ef59","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3478371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John C.
