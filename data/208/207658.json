All Greek temples are dedicated to Apollo etc, and this particular one was not dedicated to anyone and is in a place where there never was a city nearby, in a kind of wasteland, in a ditch.  But, just by going up a bit –you are in the centre of Peloponissos- on a clear day, you can see the sea on both your left and right. I went back there, at least six, seven or eight times, as if I wanted to think or find myself.  So, at the temple in Bassae, I made a short 10 minute film and I was lucky enough to encounter two days of clouds and mist between the columns.\"  —ecofilms.gr (Jean-Daniel Pollet, Tours d’horizons, Editions de l’oeil 2005)","popularity":0.3617,"poster_path":"/gVKFO1P0f45iNGrHxtHhTTdtV3p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187391,"logo_path":null,"name":"C.M.S.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1964-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Everything will return to mud again, to ashes.
