This experience formed the basis for her book La condition ouvrière. The written chronicle of her days is visually accompanied by a continuous flow of dark rooms and the urban landscape of Île Seguin (suburbs south of Paris), paying particular attention to construction sites and factories.","popularity":0.0732,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Je suis Simone (La condition ouvrière)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1341539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudia Landi","original_name":"Claudia Landi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"53c413130e0a26157c00ccdc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":234720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giovanna Giuliani","original_name":"Giovanna Giuliani","popularity":0.0853,"profile_path":"/1RLtX1WDmjMkPpt2jqMY3qnWgOb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"53c413220e0a26157c00cce0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1341540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natacha Eychenne","original_name":"Natacha Eychenne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"53c413310e0a26157600d2c7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1341541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kamal Boukarass","original_name":"Kamal Boukarass","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"53c413410e0a26157600d2cf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1315519,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Teti","original_name":"Marco Teti","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"53c413500e0a26158f00c9d6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1341542,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilaria Tramacere","original_name":"Ilaria Tramacere","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"53c4135b0e0a26157600d2d6","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1189925,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fabrizio Ferraro","original_name":"Fabrizio Ferraro","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/8QkduRpVFUOnv2UTDaasIA5Smfb.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d2ec3a368484e1db5f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1189926,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Simone Weil","original_name":"Simone Weil","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/yYOCgs2z4RKLXpgZt5kBEnP1NBQ.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d2ec3a368484e1db5f9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1189925,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fabrizio Ferraro","original_name":"Fabrizio Ferraro","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/8QkduRpVFUOnv2UTDaasIA5Smfb.jpg","credit_id":"53c413010e0a26157600d2b8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2713042","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-12-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
