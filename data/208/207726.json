Ferocious editing sarcastically juxtaposes these good intentions with the political farce of speeches and parades, all to the tune of factory chimneys collapsing in slow motion and the exhumed body of an “unknown soldier”. —cinematek.be","popularity":0.208,"poster_path":"/PlNdhh18bSOba1FzIg9LPwP6dA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89685,"logo_path":null,"name":"Films Henri Storck","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1932-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Story of the Unknown Soldier","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1095786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benito Mussolini","original_name":"Benito Mussolini","popularity":0.3386,"profile_path":"/rizo5Ct0esQP4gQmisdJ2FkkZhq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself (archive footage)","credit_id":"59049bd0c3a3684ad700c957","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1328522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Pétain","original_name":"Philippe Pétain","popularity":0.0766,"profile_path":"/tyogBN8YQGT14O5FrrthADINgyN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself (archive footage)","credit_id":"59049be1c3a3684a8e00beb4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127372,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Czar Nicholas II of Russia","original_name":"Czar Nicholas II of Russia","popularity":0.1762,"profile_path":"/3pngMcKHAMeK8goyk1vEEzSpH5R.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself (archive footage)","credit_id":"59049bea92514169c000caeb","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130033,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henri Storck","original_name":"Henri Storck","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":"/hbOCma9IFYX4f8iNVegyEw2z5Aa.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d3bc3a368484e1ddeeb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0214768","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/PlNdhh18bSOba1FzIg9LPwP6dA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":220870,"name":"newsreel"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1932-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
