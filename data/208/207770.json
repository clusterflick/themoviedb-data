Tombs were looted, animals sacrificed and human bones arranged during a macabre ceremony. Further defilements continued at Clophill in the following years, with cattle in nearby fields found mutilated, evidence of necromancy discovered and perpetual sightings of paranormal activity witnessed at the isolated ruin. 50 years on from the original incident, the Clophill legend remains etched on the psyches of the local populace. In 2010, a documentary team was assembled to investigate the legend of the Clophill witches and to try and uncover the truth behind the paranormal events. What followed during that long weekend at Clophill was a terrifying journey into the unknown.","popularity":0.3478,"poster_path":"/pHHVRgy47P8RONXUnMa3C9IBbzf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":49923,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bleeding Edge","origin_country":""},{"id":144574,"logo_path":"/3CD1d9nevg5Sb4AorcNWJssGHRJ.png","name":"Off World Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Paranormal Diaries: Clophill","video":false,"vote_average":3.8,"vote_count":30,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":93064,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael G.
