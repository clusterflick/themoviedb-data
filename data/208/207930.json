Featuring live performances and interviews from such bands as Blood for Blood, Death Before Dishonor, and Righteous Jams, and featuring never-before-seen footage from bands such as Wrecking Crew, In My Eyes and Ten Yard Fight, this sequel DVD has, in many eyes, already proven itself to be the hardest and most graphic look at the hardcore scene ever. Backed with exclusive interviews by founding members of Boston's notorious F.S.U. gang and scored by a soundtrack of some of Boston's hardest music, Volume II, tells the story and history of Boston hardcore from past until present.","popularity":0.0594,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boston Beatdown: See the World Through Our Eyes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1026085,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elgin James","original_name":"Elgin James","popularity":0.1173,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4d40c3a368484e1df209","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1190895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ronin Morris","original_name":"Ronin Morris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d40c3a368484e1df205","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0471105","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-07-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
