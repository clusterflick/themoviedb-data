By documenting beekeeping activities Makela reveals how intrinsically anthropocentric our attitudes are, and how this affects the process of subjucating the honey bee into a condition of exploitable natural resource. Thru a sensitive, intimate and prolonged observation Makela discovers surprising behavior inside and outside the hive, which she offers as a set of dialogues that bring humor, poetry, reflection and an insight into the fantastic dimension of this species.","popularity":0.3539,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2022-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anthropobee","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3967723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentina Montero","original_name":"Valentina Montero","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"6415a236e9c0dc008f70aadd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3967725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriel Orrego Romeu","original_name":"Gabriel Orrego Romeu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"6415a24a31032500e8a19cc4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3967727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annick Durán Kandzior","original_name":"Annick Durán Kandzior","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"6415a265e9c0dc00ecc8e980","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3967728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valesca Díaz Àlvarez","original_name":"Valesca Díaz Àlvarez","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"6415a27a0d5d85009ba18219","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3967730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jésus Ponce","original_name":"Jésus Ponce","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"6415a2926a222700c6b36ba4","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3694669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mia Mäkelä","original_name":"Mia Mäkelä","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6415a2d80d5d850083866a71","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3694669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mia Mäkelä","original_name":"Mia Mäkelä","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6415a2c8e7414600b96a6695","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3694669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mia Mäkelä","original_name":"Mia Mäkelä","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6415a2bde74146007c81b14f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3694669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mia Mäkelä","original_name":"Mia Mäkelä","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6415a2a65690b500bb01195a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3967736,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Taller Cicuta","original_name":"Taller Cicuta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6415a2fde9c0dc00ecc8e9d8","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3967734,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Matías Serrano Acevedo","original_name":"Matías Serrano Acevedo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6415a2e9e7414600f7edd545","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3694669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mia Mäkelä","original_name":"Mia Mäkelä","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6415a2ad0d5d8500ba0f0761","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3967736,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Taller Cicuta","original_name":"Taller Cicuta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6415a3105690b5010161db7a","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":193067,"name":"beekeeping"},{"id":263460,"name":"bees"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
