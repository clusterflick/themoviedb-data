The film traces the journey of butter from cows grazing, to milking, to the final churning of milk into a crock of gold – packets of butter –  much to the delight of the children. It is a simple delight, and moments like the creative sound mixing in the laboratory scene gives you a taste of Spence’s filmmaking talents.","popularity":0.0331,"poster_path":"/55MV4O27Ay9HL3syBJHuNyyIWeK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crock of Gold","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2229011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roy Spence","original_name":"Roy Spence","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":"/tU2Ea24rp1bTEwOJ7JktGHbQVP8.jpg","credit_id":"6414a6efb42242416dd849ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1923,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/55MV4O27Ay9HL3syBJHuNyyIWeK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1284}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
