He hoped for a just America, where poverty would no longer have a place. Social equality was for him the only guarantee of a true emancipation. During the last four years of his life, he mobilized all his energy to realize this \"other dream\". But there were many obstacles: he was scorned by white, racist America, abandoned by the political class, but also by some of his own people, who decided to turn their backs on the principle of non-violence.","popularity":0.6099,"poster_path":"/t2k0M1lX4LKthYNk4loLZDrDdL8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":58542,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brotherfilms","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Martin Luther King: More Than One Dream","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Martin Luther King: More Than One Dream","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Martin Luther King: More Than One Dream","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1107983,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Luther King Jr.","original_name":"Martin Luther King Jr.","popularity":0.3236,"profile_path":"/5AYILU60HVNMWmhDEhFtnJVv31O.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"648b1b28076ce8010610236e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":237876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah-Jane Sauvegrain","original_name":"Sarah-Jane Sauvegrain","popularity":0.1702,"profile_path":"/g0jhgPHkaziDzqODpbGs8Fr3w3W.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"648b1b2f559d2200e204b82b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1488983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Necek","original_name":"Barbara Necek","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6416ad710d5d8500e0e6769d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27412421","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zGXbQY2YuIlDT2M3qmo5Bjn3KHO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/2jx2YCrVmRZWBSsDOwpk3OxZL9j.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/ij4PSmiIsRwcuQPE4WeAILqAzxg.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1974,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/oGwq9peLXZGVRAhzfhU1Ov34YOV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1402},{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":1696,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/t2k0M1lX4LKthYNk4loLZDrDdL8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1191}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4098,"name":"civil rights"},{"id":5835,"name":"martin luther king"},{"id":14548,"name":"political assassination"},{"id":156875,"name":"nobel peace prize"},{"id":208647,"name":"activist"},{"id":298926,"name":"non violence"},{"id":338212,"name":"american pastor"},{"id":338213,"name":"presidential medal of freedom"},{"id":338214,"name":"i have a dream"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
