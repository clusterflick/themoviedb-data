The film is 45 minutes long––perfect for classroom use and repeated screenings by stu-dents on their own. It's my response to the flawed Ken Burn/Lynn Novick 18-hour PBS series, The Vietnam War... too long for the classroom and failing in many ways as a useful account of the tragic Viet Nam war.  It’s free to stream or download the film from this website, so teachers, help yourselves. I’ve also provided a curriculum, produced by the Zinn Education Project’s Rethinking Schools for teaching this film, and some additional useful writings for understanding the Viet Nam War.","popularity":0.1445,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Notes and Images From the Vietnam War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"For Teachers and Students - Notes and Images from the Vietnam War","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1111947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jill Godmilow","original_name":"Jill Godmilow","popularity":0.1935,"profile_path":"/L6v4GOwASyRLeU0ldDMVhvxwVv.jpg","credit_id":"64139541a6c10400c0c6ce53","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
