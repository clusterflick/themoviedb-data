The patient then claims that Charles will not testify in court or to the police because the patient is openly part of the LGBT community. Further, the patient claims that Charles has recently gone through a religious conversion in his own personal identity which has resulted in a fully prejudiced reassessment of the gay community as a whole. Charles claims that the basis of these accusations are false and due to a misunderstanding. The resulting recriminations put Charles's entire career at risk and threaten to end his practice permanently.","popularity":0.8985,"poster_path":"/tUQP4JRNV6loEqs0xRSAKW8La8a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114788,"logo_path":"/qIARCGI6GCNqQsfomg3pr0au3T.png","name":"Èliseo
