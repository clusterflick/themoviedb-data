The Southport Slasher Ben Willis sent a similar note to Julie James 25 years ago before wreaking havoc on the town, but that's just an old story. Is this some anniversary prank, or are they really in trouble? They and their girlfriends realize too late that they're in the wrong place at the wrong time...  A queer horror fan film celebrating the 25th anniversary of the I Know What You Did Last Summer franchise, following the events of the original 1997 film (with a nod to the 1998 sequel).","popularity":0.1856,"poster_path":"/77yG7T9xhMXIioesplFQpax05q8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":197782,"logo_path":null,"name":"MJP POV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"He's real and he's back.","title":"Your Last Summer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Your Last Summer: A Fan Film","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3965335,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian MacGillivray","original_name":"Ian MacGillivray","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/azmTrv6x6UzpJQ6THw6OUFzYc8W.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jesse","credit_id":"64135dc499259c00d70614e9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3965336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Spies","original_name":"Ryan Spies","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Hank","credit_id":"64135dd026677800d706e911","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3965337,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olivia Barberian","original_name":"Olivia Barberian","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Reese","credit_id":"64135ddc323eba00a2a907ed","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3965338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jenna Kathleen McLaughlin","original_name":"Jenna Kathleen McLaughlin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Bridget","credit_id":"64135de3ede1b0287fdbefaa","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1539676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisabeth Freeman","original_name":"Elisabeth Freeman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Missy Egan","credit_id":"64135e04532acb0099000e3f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":237169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Sarrazin","original_name":"Stephen Sarrazin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Ben Willis / Fisherman","credit_id":"64135e1fb4224200d8671ac5","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1676786,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark J.
