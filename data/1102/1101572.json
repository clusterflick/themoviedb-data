In April 1994, the international community sat by and watched while a million Tutsi men, women and children were massacred in the central African nation. Sitting on a Volcano, the first volume in the three-part Rwanda series, follows the exodus of hundreds of thousands of Hutus who fled Rwanda to take refuge in neighbouring countries. One year after the slaughter, they find themselves trapped beween gangs of Rwandan war criminals in control of the refugee camps and their country's new masters, who show little interest in reconciliation. Sitting on a Volcano criticizes the international community, which continues to feed the killers in the refugee camps and refuses to acknowledge human rights violations in Rwanda.","popularity":0.0817,"poster_path":"/pBLgWE2QMHnERnWDt3GKfzx1TRs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sitting on a Volcano","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2143152,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danièle Lacourse","original_name":"Danièle Lacourse","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64152e2b6a22270085ef5b3e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498513,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nick Hector","original_name":"Nick Hector","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":"/gtgBIbIU01FfEduOI0y1TRlnLN2.jpg","credit_id":"642a24e3a3e4ba3248d7dfe5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pBLgWE2QMHnERnWDt3GKfzx1TRs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
