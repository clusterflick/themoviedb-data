In the early 1920s, Aleister Crowley, the most famous occultist of his time, lived in the building, practicing magical rituals. In the summer of 1955, Kenneth Anger, considered one of the pioneers of experimental cinema, traveled with sexologist Alfred Kinsey to Sicily to find Aleister Crowley’s temple to shoot a film about the occultist’s time in Cefalú. The Thelema Abbey film was never released.","popularity":0.2075,"poster_path":"/ozbqyTRIzlSqAS2JQLD1BgxFXTj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132852,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atalante Oy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2023-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"House of the Wickedest Man in the World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2198060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Clamp","original_name":"Rebecca Clamp","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"6415be89e9c0dc008f70b5b9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1969712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Stanley","original_name":"Richard Stanley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"6415bebae9c0dc007b993ec1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1158395,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Ijäs","original_name":"Jan Ijäs","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6415bef56a222700c6b37771","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2198061,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Svante Colérus","original_name":"Svante Colérus","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6415bd2f0d5d85007b6796a7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1703572,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ville Piippo","original_name":"Ville Piippo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/pFIUe3gqEFhI4sFVxPtAiYkIxPY.jpg","credit_id":"6415bd065690b500d400b574","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2657167,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lauri Ainala","original_name":"Lauri Ainala","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6415bd1e5690b5010161e565","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1158395,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Ijäs","original_name":"Jan Ijäs","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6415bce56a222700e9751d53","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1158395,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Ijäs","original_name":"Jan Ijäs","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6415bed96a222700e9751e1b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1158395,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Ijäs","original_name":"Jan Ijäs","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6415bcf3e741460082162243","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1158395,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Ijäs","original_name":"Jan Ijäs","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6415bc2a0d5d85008386744e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2462864,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Juho Liukkonen","original_name":"Juho Liukkonen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64259aca37b3a900d5f942ea","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2053163,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Matti Ahopelto","original_name":"Matti Ahopelto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64259ad5c0442901f00138f9","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27007955","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9MypnC5SYKIcE8iUAM1aBeadIsT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1282}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ozbqyTRIzlSqAS2JQLD1BgxFXTj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":131,"name":"italy"},{"id":629,"name":"sicily, italy"},{"id":14964,"name":"drugs"},{"id":162715,"name":"ruins"},{"id":207876,"name":"1920s"},{"id":243001,"name":"rituals"},{"id":254630,"name":"occultism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Tampere Film Festival","release_date":"2023-03-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
