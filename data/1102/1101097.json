After studying photography, Eshetu began making videos in early 1982, seeking to deconstruct the hegemonic status of television, which he viewed as a state apparatus. His practice encompasses documentaries, installations, and films, and he uses moving images “to create or construct an artistic message, a sort of personal reality rather than an institutional reality or a political reality.” Born in London and based in Rome, Eshetu, whose work has been shown in the Venice Biennale, is interested in cultivating a global perspective in his art, drawing inspiration from his pan-national life, including his upbringing in Senegal and Ethiopia.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/obfgF055dix438AZK2ZAn8SSCph.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anima Mundi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1830628,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Theo Eshetu","original_name":"Theo Eshetu","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d09fe79b26114fe10197a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/obfgF055dix438AZK2ZAn8SSCph.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g5tRPl0OAiMeEfrzxbQziBH1eQk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
