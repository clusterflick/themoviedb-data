A localised uprising in the Bavarian capital of Munich, led by a small man with a toothbrush moustache and a poisonous yet compelling grandiloquence, would have repercussions that would lead to the political shackling of an entire nation, the most abhorrent crimes of the century and a world war.  You might say, Adolf Hitler came of age amid the smell of sweat and sawdust of a Munich beer hall.  In the political chaos of 1923, he was a local irritant, gaining popularity among workers and soldiers, the ethos of his Nazi Party spreading like a virus. His first attempt at attaining true power came with an attempted putsch on the already separatist government of Bavaria, which left him imprisoned.","popularity":0.157,"poster_path":"/e1pkmDjjMD84Kd85iEFXjSFDWTu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48830,"logo_path":"/Ab0UOtsoszMXhmcwcKp59wE6wKa.png","name":"3DD Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hitler's Putsch: The Birth of the Nazi Party","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"1923, Le Putsch d'Hitler","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Hitler's Coup 1923","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2799988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giles Milton","original_name":"Giles Milton","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/9nIxI19luuFstj2wWYTrGSqcT82.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self - Narrator","credit_id":"656c3cd1cede69013c98da53","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4054187,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William Simpson","original_name":"William Simpson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645b15b76aa8e00173816ef7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1018936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lyndy Saville","original_name":"Lyndy Saville","popularity":0.1068,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645b17d377d23b00e2f688cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2219150,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dominic Saville","original_name":"Dominic Saville","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645b17286aa8e0011ca2663e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30096737","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/6aZpUebLyVC9nfmhlO4nzy76ic2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pDz4x15pmp36CerwVLsgH11l5G2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/yhgFPl2jsePOQIWIHYUFSG4sjtO.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/e1pkmDjjMD84Kd85iEFXjSFDWTu.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tDBQpJqcSj8FiLOQHLFBaEDdn9K.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/tq7HDOJno33BskHpeSZl89lRyHC.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2437,"name":"munich, germany"},{"id":241930,"name":"adolf hitler"},{"id":281177,"name":"german history"},{"id":325659,"name":"putsch"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
