Through a combination of meticulous cataloging of crab egg numbers & the physical health of various shorebirds of interest and careful monitoring of migratory flight paths, these scientists are crafting a body of scientific data that can be used to influence state & federal policies related to the conservation of coastal wetlands and bays from crab overharvesting and commercial development.  An inspiring story of the scientist and field biologist's successful efforts to connect an ancient ecosystem with the interconnected relationship of the moon, tides, Horseshoe crabs and sandpipers.","popularity":0.1216,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Horseshoe Crab Moon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3965468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mitchell Smith","original_name":"Mitchell Smith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6413713499259c00f622f8ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15174,"name":"ecology"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bullfrog Films presents...Horseshoe Crab Moon","key":"801663937","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-02-23T16:51:58.000Z","id":"64137085532acb00990012ab"}]}}}
