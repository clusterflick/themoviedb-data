The doc illustrates the multifaceted journeys of trailblazing gay pioneers in the objects they left behind, including 19th-century stage actress Charlotte Cushman's Cardinal Wolsey costume; a first edition copy of poet Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass; love letters among World War II soldiers, and more. The documentary features commentary from LGBTQ+ icons like Matthew Shepard's parents, Stonewall eyewitness participant Mark Segal, and Gene Robinson, the first openly gay priest to be consecrated a bishop by the Episcopal Church.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/uoAT3ls98tFKekoiLB95EQK85A8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond Stonewall","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Smithsonian Time Capsule: Beyond Stonewall","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3966094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Lintelman","original_name":"Ryan Lintelman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64140794b422424189591033","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4133017,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ted Tuel","original_name":"Ted Tuel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653c8686bc2cb300c97dfd32","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4134058,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert G.
