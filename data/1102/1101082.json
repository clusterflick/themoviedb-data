Return to Eden refers to Josef Klein's return to America after several decades abroad, but return to Eden also refers to a longing for absolutes, for a return to paradise, which seems essential if we are to survive this time of darkness. A perspective he shares with the young girls he mentors, as a volunteer tennis coach at one of the local high schools, and a passion which is responsible for his deep sense of loneliness, a feeling of not belonging. Loneliness which is temporarily relieved when he meets Hope, a brilliant and equally lonely woman, who happens to be a dancer in Puritan Eden's only strip club. An unlikely and exhilarating friendship with tragic consequences.","popularity":0.2992,"poster_path":"/8bNp8KcuYrLu6FziezUAor2axC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Return to Eden","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gary Kohn","original_name":"Gary Kohn","popularity":0.1412,"profile_path":"/43mmY7Wu9JcnpzAhemiOUdO3W7S.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Josef","credit_id":"6413633cede1b028a2b8df33","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":168530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claude Duhamel","original_name":"Claude Duhamel","popularity":0.2165,"profile_path":"/8Aj1P12mLw60dthwD1JHp4GB3Y5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Fred","credit_id":"6413635bb4224200b9747171","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1889445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Kinney","original_name":"Jim Kinney","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"36","credit_id":"64136368323eba00ef641352","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2004828,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jeff Gross","original_name":"Jeff Gross","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6413638dede1b028e84e24c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2004828,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jeff Gross","original_name":"Jeff Gross","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6413639bede1b028e84e24ca","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8bNp8KcuYrLu6FziezUAor2axC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
