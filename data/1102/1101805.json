The purgatory begins to refract the dreamers mind, as they are confronted with multiple incarnations of themselves struggling to awake.  Bed & Breakfast is inspired by the neurodivergent experience of procrastination, and inertia. Questioning the nature of memory, identity, and the fabric of reality, by plunging you into the psyche of a paralysed dreamer where reality is far repressed.","popularity":0.3805,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No
