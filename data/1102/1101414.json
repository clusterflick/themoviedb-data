This scene orientates the viewer, but we are quickly taken into an imaginary space offered by the trees, shot against a late evening sky. A floating camera and the dense superimposition of shots make for a scene that is now untethered. Towards the end we see the sun set over the sea; confirmation of the lyrical strain in much of Le Griceâ€™s cinema.","popularity":0.0218,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dark Trees","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1278000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Malcolm Le Grice","original_name":"Malcolm Le Grice","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":"/dXry25TyoLUpViu8Paqf6RMkDv7.jpg","credit_id":"6414b3165690b5007a53c276","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
