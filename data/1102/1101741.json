It is a film about anxiety spreading from one person to the next, about despair over lost opportunities, about the moment you are robbed of your future. It shows people stranded in a black hole of history, gasping for air like a fish on dry land, writhing in agony like a snake held in the grip of a devil that has declared itself the master.","popularity":0.0289,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2022-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rhythm of My Land","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3967977,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mohammed Hashim Didari","original_name":"Mohammed Hashim Didari","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6415cd720d5d8500f2d67961","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
