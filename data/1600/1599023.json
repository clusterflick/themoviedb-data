It is more than a place for utilitarian transactions; it becomes a space where even the most routine gestures carry emotional weight. At its heart, the film reflects on hospitality, service, and the lasting importance of community spaces that bring people together. A search for a tool often turns into a reunion, a lingering conversation, or a moment that reaffirms one's sense of belonging. The film follows the rhythm of a single day, from unlocking the doors at first light to closing them after dusk. These repeated actions form a structure in which trust is built, and neighbourly bonds are sustained.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"In a place where people remember your name, understand your project, and honour your story, a small-town store transforms into a gathering space for everyone.","title":"The Things We Carry Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
