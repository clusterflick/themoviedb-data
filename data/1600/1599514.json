After cutting the umbilical cord, the baby cries, but her cry is silent. Maria, her mother, tries to ask what is wrong, but she is also unable to use her voice. After performing several tests, the doctors discover that anything that comes into contact with Silvia's skin loses the ability to emit sound. As an adult, Silvia runs a small flower shop in a neighborhood of Madrid, inherited from her mother. She decides to lead a quiet and solitary life, aware of what she can do to anyone who touches her. However, when she meets Marco, a musician of great talent, his fragile balance begins to crumble.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/sf8PtIDJcGkjWVnxcvIWL2BsptF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":230902,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmakers Monkeys","origin_country":""},{"id":9965,"logo_path":"/sxA2AfKijRSS1dxcXejJ27wg20H.png","name":"Ánima Estudios","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Silence Sometimes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2264141,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Álvaro Robles","original_name":"Álvaro Robles","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6942058403803a19eb260df7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2264141,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Álvaro Robles","original_name":"Álvaro Robles","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69420597128b7fcc5532a7aa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2159365,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"José Luis Ágreda","original_name":"José Luis Ágreda","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694205a0275073b812d7378b","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4593142,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Néstor López","original_name":"Néstor López","popularity":0.1417,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694205b1cbd039caca32a7b1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1471751,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fernando de Fuentes Sainz","original_name":"Fernando De Fuentes Sainz","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694205e14e2349583fab158c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30831789","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tz5AOqXrip8K3k9aEszwiAsYPFQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2026,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sf8PtIDJcGkjWVnxcvIWL2BsptF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1520}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
