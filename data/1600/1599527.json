There, she meets Misi, the former priest who lost an arm in an accident and was removed from his duties after a campaign led by Teó’s mother. Seeking revenge, Misi plans to use the people’s nightmares. Teó, struggling with artistic block, agrees with Misi to paint the church. Inspired by the Doom Paintings about the Last Judgment, she begins collecting villagers’ nightmares to paint the walls. Haunted by visions of her mother and her own fears, Teó wrestles with faith, art, and memory. She turns the church into her masterpiece — blending horror, healing, and reckoning, challenging Misi, and herself.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/pEpRM8pKMzURGNnjcPeyZJurNtk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":283427,"logo_path":null,"name":"Domestic Infelicity","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"The Wild and the Tame","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1938165,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tibor Bánóczki","original_name":"Tibor Bánóczki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69420c8a9eaac80fd932a7ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1938165,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tibor Bánóczki","original_name":"Tibor Bánóczki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69420c8e92ccd60869ab15a2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1938165,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tibor Bánóczki","original_name":"Tibor Bánóczki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69420c9417c68664aa2dbc43","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1938165,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tibor Bánóczki","original_name":"Tibor Bánóczki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69420c9d9eea57554c32a7ac","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2262370,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarolta Szabó","original_name":"Sarolta Szabó","popularity":0.0852,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69420ca6e87cb39ff608f35e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2262370,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarolta Szabó","original_name":"Sarolta Szabó","popularity":0.0852,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69420ca97f1d55da30260dfb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2262370,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarolta Szabó","original_name":"Sarolta Szabó","popularity":0.0852,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69420caffeed37c915e80ea3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2262370,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarolta Szabó","original_name":"Sarolta Szabó","popularity":0.0852,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69420cb4068f770e9b7a2905","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2026,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pEpRM8pKMzURGNnjcPeyZJurNtk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1520}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
