A fireman moves in next to her, and they get in a dispute over him throwing leaves on her property. The dispute turns into her being gang stalked by all her neighbors and she decides to move to Oceanside, California. But once in California, Bonnie notices the gang stalking hasn’t stopped – the color red becomes her focus point. On May 29th, the color black is added to Bonnie’s radar, and then, in mid-July, the color white. Bonnie begins to document and post online what she perceives as Exit/Entry Gang Stalking: as she pulls in or out of their driveway, comes in or out of her house to pick up her mail or takes out the garbage.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/y0xKdkSOJESVzNMvjvm7k3p1HR2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Exit/Entry","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1566091,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Leo Gabin","original_name":"Leo Gabin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6942944c09751f1e624e3f0a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5570596","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/y0xKdkSOJESVzNMvjvm7k3p1HR2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"FID Marseille","release_date":"2016-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
