A strange fog —strange, toxic, and filled with monsters— covers the city, and probably the world, up to the height of the 13th floor. Below, no one was left alive. Above... Above the 13th floor, only those who, on that day when the fog appeared, chose not to go down survived. It’s been five months since that day, and most of them are still alive. But most doesn’t mean all. Because no one survives five months above an ocean of monsters without learning how to fish them —and no one learns how to fish them without finding something to use. They, the survivors, found something. They found it very quickly. And they founded a new world. A terrifying new world.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/36UVNcVR8p5H3dblGLGACkz2eYO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":283367,"logo_path":null,"name":"TREBOAMEDIA","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"13th Floor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5457698,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Soraya Antelo Morales","original_name":"Soraya Antelo Morales","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69417d1b3bfd3ae94bc01bc4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3256109,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Martin Gil","original_name":"Martin Gil","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69417d2678f1a0fa0f3c543f","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5881047,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Roberto González Méndez","original_name":"Roberto González Méndez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69417d4f61defeba3ba04176","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5881048,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paula Mariñas","original_name":"Paula Mariñas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69417da514ae3551a29c51a3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2026,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/36UVNcVR8p5H3dblGLGACkz2eYO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1520}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
