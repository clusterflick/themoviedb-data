Forced to celebrate Midsummer at his grandmother’s chaotic country house, his worst nightmares come true. He is transported to a floral fantasy world with everything Sander detests: untamed nature, impulsive creatures, and a total lack of discipline. When he meets the enchanting Solar Queen, Sander finds a counterpart in his strive for order. But the Solar Queen is planning a gruesome Midsummer ritual, and Sander must confront his worst fear: revealing his own imperfection and vulnerability. Sander’s Midsummer is a story of self-acceptance and reconnection - with nature, ourselves, and the people who love us.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/jj4oMYhykkzlzsJb9CkuHta28fX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48790,"logo_path":"/32GzgUtNMmTHQEZH7bQ8ZSagv4i.png","name":"Mikrofilm","origin_country":"NO"},{"id":98153,"logo_path":null,"name":"Den Siste Skilling","origin_country":"NO"},{"id":129632,"logo_path":"/jzb3kMZoduZpmah196QmW9ACGMg.png","name":"Knudsen Pictures","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Sander's Midsummer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2583400,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hanne Berkaak","original_name":"Hanne Berkaak","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6942036f110093ee505c59d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1289212,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bobbie Peers","original_name":"Bobbie Peers","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":"/6uyn7lLXO0qdbY62WhoMVGAkx9M.jpg","credit_id":"69420379cb2202b6efda1669","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2508535,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tonje Skar Reiersen","original_name":"Tonje Skar Reiersen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/w7K76idK9qaFCutWRmgKC8y0Kwj.jpg","credit_id":"69420382ac7249121f13b728","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937779,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kristine Knudsen","original_name":"Kristine Knudsen","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694203b4497bde5d2720f742","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5123465,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sandra Salvador Perez","original_name":"Sandra Salvador Perez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694203c556779cf4543f9045","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2026,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jj4oMYhykkzlzsJb9CkuHta28fX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1520}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
