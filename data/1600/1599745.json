Fascinated by the contrast between her public image and private experiences, he reached out to her to play a fictionalized version of herself in a character-driven film. Whitney kindly declined, seeing no connection between her work and the film’s themes. Despite this, Muhammad remains committed to the project, developing it as a cinematic exploration of identity, displacement, and self-definition. The story follows a woman inspired by Whitney’s journeys, navigating conflict, cultural complexity, and human resilience, reflecting on judgment, meaning, and personal growth while pursuing its strong artistic potential","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/HtkayQzDWRM3LtqeXoRrJmeFww.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"“Beyond the Screen: A Journey Through Borders and Boundaries.”","title":"Untitled Muhammad Abed Baryal film (Whitney Wright)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1842045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Whitney Wright","original_name":"Whitney Wright","popularity":21.609,"profile_path":"/rrpgHJnZ1L3QWFlPSbrpJDXR3YZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6942adab591bb22a9fe80ffd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5352745,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Muhammad Abed Baryal","original_name":"Muhammad Abed Baryal","popularity":0.0918,"profile_path":"/4FG0CJ5t4iL4UTDWr4DGy7VqaH8.jpg","credit_id":"6942add4d3876ea5147a2c11","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36937754","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2046,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/HtkayQzDWRM3LtqeXoRrJmeFww.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1364}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9935,"name":"travel"},{"id":215779,"name":"real story"},{"id":285028,"name":"story"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
