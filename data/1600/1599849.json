In one, she is transported to ancient Rome where she appears as a much-admired woman in love with Paul, a young heretic, and at odds with Lutor, the high priest. To save her love, she poisons Lutor with her ring. After several other visions which involve variations on this love triangle, Elinore awakens to discover that Lutor is actually her doctor, Sascha Jaccard, and that Paul is the son of a friend who has come to visit the recovering prima donna.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/oi3NtVb02qpvPpq95Yls3obuvxM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1920-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Sister to Salome","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"廻る因果","type":"Japanese title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gladys Brockwell","original_name":"Gladys Brockwell","popularity":0.1549,"profile_path":"/jpo2C8eHFUrb451hWnfaPGqq5jh.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Elinore Duane","credit_id":"6942cfe04a9ef993c808f639","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1118888,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Scott","original_name":"William Scott","popularity":0.2042,"profile_path":"/dLmPRQN4PwYex3TofUCNY1o1Ja.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Paul Kingston","credit_id":"6942cfeb65b1dc1fae08f61e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1405534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edwin B.
