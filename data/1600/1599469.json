The synchronisation fails and the host of the ritual, a young girl, dies before the eyes of her mother, Makena. Devastated, Makena sets fire to the Tree-Universe and seizes the Artefact of Time, determined and convinced that she can defy the forbidden to bring her child back to life. Faced with this senseless act that threatens to tear the universes apart, the Baka Elders awaken Kokum, an ancient tracker who has been asleep for centuries. Accompanied by his symbiote Tauto, he embarks on a race against time, a perilous quest to find Makena and restore balance.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/zMXrwRGLQWKJslTQMdLz4WpHg2x.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19437,"logo_path":"/1VqbDOThEcmDR6gn7et7cAs4lwr.png","name":"Paul Thiltges Distributions","origin_country":"LU"},{"id":122128,"logo_path":"/iYPn1TwMpJXPRTF9O0m4h0nEmCS.png","name":"Special Touch Studios","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LU","name":"Luxembourg"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Kokum","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5757863,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hassan Yola","original_name":"Hassan Yola","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6941eb97fae3850b0ed3414b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5757863,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hassan Yola","original_name":"Hassan Yola","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6941eb9b973bda50bfda168e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2421186,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adrien Chef","original_name":"Adrien Chef","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6941ebab0e190b831eda164b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1688079,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sébastien Onomo","original_name":"Sébastien Onomo","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6941ebdc342d1fd734a6e45d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.738,"height":975,"iso_3166_1":"FR","iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/zMXrwRGLQWKJslTQMdLz4WpHg2x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
