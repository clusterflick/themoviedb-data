Stanton then arranges to be transferred to the Mexican border, and while fighting there is badly wounded. When she hears the news about Stanton's condition, Miss Gray faints, and then dreams that she has been transported to Elizabethan times. Then, after Bacon falls in love with her, she discovers his obsessive jealousy of Shakespeare, and learns that he has bribed a courtier to accuse him of stealing Bacon's plays. As a result, when Miss Gray wakes up, she realizes that she has championed the wrong poet, and so she immediately is reconciled with Stanton, who soon recovers from his wound.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/xetIRYdcBcGROhJCFIBk3bfz7Qu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":176030,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thanhouser Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Master Shakespeare, Strolling Player","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1171440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence La Badie","original_name":"Florence La Badie","popularity":0.8156,"profile_path":"/7vb4YEwmvKQoYgTtq4UvbzvOaME.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Miss Gray","credit_id":"69419ca11251b3ea50dc2d20","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1591391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Vaughn","original_name":"Robert Vaughn","popularity":0.1894,"profile_path":"/MxZHx6SIjVnGdgJXEwCUOy4DQU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lieutenant Stanton","credit_id":"69419cb0fdf817aaef5583d4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5049076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lawrence Swinburne","original_name":"Lawrence Swinburne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"William Shakespeare","credit_id":"69419cbf382e4ebaa8244a7e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350666,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Whittier","original_name":"Robert Whittier","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Francis Bacon","credit_id":"69419cce61b4b60357509cd6","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederick Sullivan","original_name":"Frederick Sullivan","popularity":0.0895,"profile_path":"/9AcXioLR9mScDWRFjrgi5gcLdyA.jpg","credit_id":"69419d057987fa6498dc2d23","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1120817,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Edwin Thanhouser","original_name":"Edwin Thanhouser","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69419d2d910c692162b2481f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4456206,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Charles W.
