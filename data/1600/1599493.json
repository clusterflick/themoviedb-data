One day, everything changes when a cleaning crew washes away their nest — and with it, their only egg. Heartbroken, they set off in search of a new home and a renewed sense of purpose. Along the way, they befriend a young ring-necked parakeet named Brutti and eventually find an abandoned egg. While caring for the egg and for each other, they learn that only by adapting to the changing city can they build a new life — and a family — of their own.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/wFbkDfJnNQnFEBari7anSpJkySg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108847,"logo_path":"/wXcInrUH3f5Vc2Ok13kURwUQ9Zv.png","name":"Keplerfilm","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Once Upon an Egg","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1565409,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nina Gantz","original_name":"Nina Gantz","popularity":0.1848,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6941f94fc03597e22f9dd413","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":119900,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert Alberdingk Thijm","original_name":"Robert Alberdingk Thijm","popularity":0.1264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6941f956c8e4dda71f5c5979","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1077750,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Koji Nelissen","original_name":"Koji Nelissen","popularity":0.1214,"profile_path":"/lqhPj5c3oCJB0A4kFSb6o8159aF.jpg","credit_id":"6941f960fc278c7d9913b6cf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2026,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wFbkDfJnNQnFEBari7anSpJkySg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1520}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
