At its core is Doru, a 60-year-old Romanian player whose life is as elusive as the game itself: a labyrinth of illusions and manipulations. As Doru reveals the secrets of the game and recounts his nomadic life story across Europe to the director Antoine, the line between reality and illusion begins to blur, until the world itself feels like one grand shell game.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":8675,"logo_path":"/nhGrnKdP6GFXLk6fbLARjQNSMET.png","name":"Walking The Dog","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":154747,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hutong Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":17281,"logo_path":"/17pP7l5vNh1wvbvTIR5lhGYDoAp.png","name":"Aparte Film","origin_country":"RO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Smecheria or the Con­fi­dences of a Cheat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3049005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antoine Fontaine","original_name":"Antoine Fontaine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6942075cbabe9586f0ab1594","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3049005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antoine Fontaine","original_name":"Antoine Fontaine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6942076cc423539fc84e3ca8","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2947845,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Joost Jansen","original_name":"Joost Jansen","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69420776b20e0b0ab8ab1592","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1006856,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eric Goossens","original_name":"Eric Goossens","popularity":0.09,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694207bbacac9a0480d73796","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5540257,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lucie Rego","original_name":"Lucie Rego","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694207c6ff28dd70687a2904","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1126318,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anca Damian","original_name":"Anca Damian","popularity":0.1526,"profile_path":"/3AkX5V5hWG9VkZEe5v52VKgG0WQ.jpg","credit_id":"694207d1babe9586f0ab159a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
