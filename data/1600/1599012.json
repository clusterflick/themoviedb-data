The inmates include Earl Isaacs, who murdered six members of the rural Alday family; Henry Jarrette; Roy Wayne Isaacs; and others. The documentary features interviews with the condemned men, the men's relatives, and the relatives of the victims. By presenting these accounts and discussions on the deterrent effect and concept of just punishment with \"no questioning, no cross-examination, no real conclusions,\" the film allows the viewer to assess the human dimensions and complexities of the death penalty debate.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":217734,"logo_path":null,"name":"WNET 13","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1977-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Murder One","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006141,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fleming B.
