It’s a dirty place. So dirty, you can almost smell the burnt coffee and the charred toast. Here lives a man in isolation who does not trust the sounds around him. Are they ghosts? He is obsessed with Tommy Cooper, the comedian who died on the stage while the audience laughed – as they thought it was part of the show. Filmmaker Helen Anna Flanagan performs a magic trick that lets the man and his idol become one.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Burnt Toast","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5883333,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helen Anna Flanagan","original_name":"Helen Anna Flanagan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6942f438e42761c0231d2354","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
