As Sunil and his mother Jayanti replay the police investigation and their everyday encounters, their attention turns toward Malo, their young tribal neighbor who lives on the margins of the colony. Through fragmented conversations, cultural misunderstandings, and unspoken biases, the film examines how fear, language barriers, and social hierarchies shape the idea of an ‘outsider’ and how easily an innocent presence can become a convenient suspect.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/h7cYDV8T38ICt3QdprYltLnSOPg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131381,"logo_path":"/djTesVOikCyxDSw0GbFash3OUyC.png","name":"Film and Television Institute of India","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"She lives next door but never belongs.","title":"In Search of a room of one's own","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5883302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akash Deep Lakra","original_name":"Akash Deep Lakra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Sunil","credit_id":"6942ec7b66d229af157a2d32","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5883303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janki Tudu","original_name":"Janki Tudu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Malo","credit_id":"6942ec90c4ed64637f08f66d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5883304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sunita Gupta","original_name":"Sunita Gupta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jayanti","credit_id":"6942ecb7591bb22a9fe810f0","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5883305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sanjana Hembrom","original_name":"Sanjana Hembrom","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6942ecdf591bb22a9fe81102","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5883307,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sahil Sameer Kacchap","original_name":"Sahil Sameer Kacchap","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6942ed20ff757cfe42d73a97","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5362223,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sneha Bhabar","original_name":"Sneha Bhabar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/3oHGu0pmmGTzOl4sSiRBYNBuAyB.jpg","credit_id":"6942ed304e2349583fab199d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5883309,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dhanush B Kumar","original_name":"Dhanush B Kumar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6942ed4904b9f7fd19d73bee","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5883310,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mansi Jani","original_name":"Mansi Jani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6942ed68dcfbc7a2124e44e0","department":"Production","job":"Production Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h7cYDV8T38ICt3QdprYltLnSOPg.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1587},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eqazSxpEjnJLiFa2cqPzhEEIIK2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
