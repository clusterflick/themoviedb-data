He ends up in Bouzin, a remote village where his uncle Gilou, Mayor Riton, and a group of hunters are addicted to gluten-free beer and crazy ideas. Very quickly, everything goes haywire: between a conspiracy theorist digging a bunker, a crooked entrepreneur, and a prophecy of the end of the world, Bouzin becomes the scene of collective madness. A pyramid of Babel, a regional coup, a survivalist sect, and an assault vehicle follow one another in an explosive satire on ordinary stupidity and the thirst for power. With the Apocalypse seemingly inevitable, will Anthony win Julia's favor?","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/swCo2OZxm9dt1zNPTpfiCO8Somx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108689,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kawanimation","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Hap­py Hunt­ing vs the Apocalyspe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2124839,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Boris Belghiti","original_name":"Boris Belghiti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6941e434d52234142d13b6a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2124839,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Boris Belghiti","original_name":"Boris Belghiti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6941e4436ccdfef7b4da1689","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2124839,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Boris Belghiti","original_name":"Boris Belghiti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6941e449ff063dd88b9dd3cf","department":"Writing","job":"Characters"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1053128,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dimitri Cohen-Tanugi","original_name":"Dimitri Cohen-Tanugi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6941e456283b5c895f13b68b","department":"Writing","job":"Characters"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3815211,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Maxime Paccalet","original_name":"Maxime Paccalet","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6941e4c566cb185df2d34110","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3815178,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maxime Paccalet","original_name":"Maxime Paccalet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6941e4f8110093ee505c5968","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3815178,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maxime Paccalet","original_name":"Maxime Paccalet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6941e50a66869c8902d34120","department":"Writing","job":"Characters"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3815186,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Razetto","original_name":"Pierre Razetto","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6941e5400312f886673f9017","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3815186,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Razetto","original_name":"Pierre Razetto","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6941e5483f7d939edfda161d","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3815186,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Razetto","original_name":"Pierre Razetto","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6941e54e6c1dc936009dd39d","department":"Writing","job":"Characters"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":960,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/swCo2OZxm9dt1zNPTpfiCO8Somx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
