As he tries to figure out a way to approach her, he sees a disreputable-looking man surreptitiously hand her a diamond necklace, which she hides on her person before fading into the crowd and disappearing from sight. Later that day he visits a friend's home, and is astounded to meet that same girl. During their conversation she claims that, as a lark, she picks her friends' pockets of valuables and gives them back later--but Gerard doesn't quite buy it. It turns out that she is, in fact, not what she says she is, but not in the way Gerard thinks.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/sVlyh0Qhrly1pOEzuTsFrF9GV0j.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":175581,"logo_path":null,"name":"Frank Powell Producing Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dazzling Miss Davison","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Who Is She?","type":"Alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":83235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marjorie Rambeau","original_name":"Marjorie Rambeau","popularity":0.2422,"profile_path":"/cAUbCP4mm0L7msFyJnAiidxEUa8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Rachel - The Dazzling Miss Davison","credit_id":"694197b170c65e4290244a77","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1329133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Williams","original_name":"Fred Williams","popularity":0.0899,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Guiding Light for Miss Davison","credit_id":"694197c270c65e4290244a7b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2829089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aubrey Beattie","original_name":"Aubrey Beattie","popularity":0.0844,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Miss Davison's Shadow","credit_id":"694197d1dd59afba0b5583d1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agnes Ayres","original_name":"Agnes Ayres","popularity":0.6682,"profile_path":"/mQObJxwBA3epElaMwpDsXCvaQeH.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lillian - Miss Davison's Sister","credit_id":"694197e124cde3a9945583c9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Elliott","original_name":"Robert Elliott","popularity":0.1955,"profile_path":"/qYExhk4bwDE4nTRa3d6n3PLNFdJ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Gerard Buckland","credit_id":"694197ebaa480910a9437fa9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":977271,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Winifred Harris","original_name":"Winifred Harris","popularity":0.1578,"profile_path":"/fFtaIroBXjTJ3G55e6f0iJHOIzR.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mrs. Jennings","credit_id":"694197f61b4cb1752a3f821e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3665746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank A.
