Unknowingly dead, the picaroons meet in the first act and, after the introductions, they understand they are both looking for S. Alessio. At whatever time Curzio and Marzio appear, they change moustaches and hats. In the second act, the picaroons understand they are dead, and meeting S. Alessio they will discover he has their same face. A fanfare, instead of a funeral march, will end the work and their existence.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/hKRCzM0wZEvmMbRMCJZCoKyaMLu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Curzio e Marzio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3115233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dario Bacis","original_name":"Dario Bacis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6942b58bd38e5e4d9f7a2d5e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1380320,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luca Ferri","original_name":"Luca Ferri","popularity":0.0586,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6942b59bad6105b9847a2b0e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1380323,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dario Agazzi","original_name":"Dario Agazzi","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6942b5ab68a6f117a74e3ff6","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3990758","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hKRCzM0wZEvmMbRMCJZCoKyaMLu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
