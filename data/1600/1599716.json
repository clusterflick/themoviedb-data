It is the oldest democracy in Latin America. This film explores the history of Costa Rica and the reasons it has been able to exist as a neutral country firmly committed to social welfare and free elections. Costa Ricans live without an army, preferring to invest their resources in hospitals and schools rather than machine guns and tanks. The film explores the issue of Costa Rica's neutrality in the face of its dependence on U.S. aid.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":124017,"logo_path":"/ioSRRQqdux1jFOxjBI5jUxcruGW.png","name":"PBS","origin_country":"US"},{"id":111563,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seven League Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":177890,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmakers Library","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Costa Rica: Child of the Wind","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27888,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raúl Juliá","original_name":"Raúl Juliá","popularity":0.9959,"profile_path":"/zRvv5vdqCxdio38gx0WWmof4cO5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narration (voice)","credit_id":"69429b1c9eea57554c32a919","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037332,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Burroughs","original_name":"Jim Burroughs","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69429b3f79040869ef2610f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037332,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Burroughs","original_name":"Jim Burroughs","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69429b58d3876ea5147a2b8d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5882664,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ceil Sutherland","original_name":"Ceil Sutherland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69429b6a4a1644463ce810f6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2468408,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jeff Wayman","original_name":"Jeff Wayman","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69429c26473aa155ac4e3f65","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4464078,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Phyllis Chinlund","original_name":"Phyllis Chinlund","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69429c30ff28dd70687a2b17","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037332,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Burroughs","original_name":"Jim Burroughs","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69429c39128b7fcc5532aa77","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72184,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brian Keane","original_name":"Brian Keane","popularity":0.0724,"profile_path":"/7uzwWfjwy31GydOoeqBgJefRfzq.jpg","credit_id":"69429c42df24077bf5e81166","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":196564,"name":"costa rica"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
