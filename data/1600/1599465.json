Having made this choice to avoid the classic military service, he finds himself without a camera in a country at war. The French army has even set up camp within the Cultural Centre. During the 18 months he spends there, the warning signs accumulate, but Samuel doesn't believe or doesn't want to believe them. What he is told seems impossible to him: France cannot possibly support a regime that commits or encourages such atrocities. It doesn't keep him though from enjoying the country and partying, but doubt creeps in, his certitudes start wavering, and Samuel finally opens his eyes.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/dpc2aTOQgcZxEVptYxgjuXp23ik.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115962,"logo_path":"/l0XMrl5uKQyUYQiRJAFMMhL5FtH.png","name":"Parmi les lucioles films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":99495,"logo_path":"/sKYJk1fq5muyDP60DRcNfflusAr.png","name":"Eklektik Productions","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":13351,"logo_path":"/3cHYz3iUqBAnQfPh8LQnEaWSh1w.png","name":"Melusine Productions","origin_country":"LU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"LU","name":"Luxembourg"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Kigali Night","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2277130,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samuel Lajus","original_name":"Samuel Lajus","popularity":0.0886,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6941e85dc28badb2fb20f709","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2277130,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samuel Lajus","original_name":"Samuel Lajus","popularity":0.0886,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6941e8630312f886673f9028","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3620305,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Romy Coccia Di Ferro","original_name":"Romy Coccia Di Ferro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/oYhGEZVLe04YIyZIXoBDRMbm7em.jpg","credit_id":"6941e86ed076930c7ca6e44e","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2813842,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grégoire Polet","original_name":"Grégoire Polet","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6941e8788a5c6f82df9dd393","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1958661,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jérôme Duc-Maugé","original_name":"Jérôme Duc-Maugé","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6941e884c9512d56719dd3a0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1322473,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Samuel Tilman","original_name":"Samuel Tilman","popularity":0.0942,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6941e88c8a5c6f82df9dd39c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3778024,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Virginie Chapelle","original_name":"Virginie Chapelle","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6941e8993a7d48b3faa6e443","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2488306,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fabien Renelli","original_name":"Fabien Renelli","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6941e8a26998403f299dd3cb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":960,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dpc2aTOQgcZxEVptYxgjuXp23ik.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
