Joakim Thåström. Today they are seen as rock gods, but in 1971 they were just teenagers. This is a film about friendship, love and creativity, but above all it’s about the limitless power of youth and how we through lust and curiosity together with our pals unconsciously forge our future selves. Thåström is a harsh existentialist while Cave is a struggling agnostic. Thåström is unbrushed and political and Cave a romantic dreamer. Our young heroes influence each other, touch on philosophies and pop culture, and blend it with a typical teenage day which mainly consists of how to skip school and get more beer and how to make the girl of both their dreams fall madly in love with them.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/qx3xkU09jHTFsuj9dBDTqOdl0Ph.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":267291,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mylla Films","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":283374,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brokendoll","origin_country":""},{"id":32314,"logo_path":"/eQ334MC49QQuy6lZnAO2RcxNREX.png","name":"Qvisten Animation","origin_country":"NO"},{"id":114311,"logo_path":"/cxQc27Lwu9CzcKpM2uTOJ0VnoRL.png","name":"Parce Que Films","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":184146,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elastic Film","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Before They Were Gods","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Cave","original_name":"Nick Cave","popularity":1.0818,"profile_path":"/rPn6Y3j3IOHRlTxCW2wHAyU6TYt.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"69418e666f409291e8244a3d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1179343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joakim Thåström","original_name":"Joakim Thåström","popularity":0.1637,"profile_path":"/njYoYZvtRjyT04AKXumepSheszE.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"69418e6d6dc189e761244a7e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80923,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Måns Mårlind","original_name":"Måns Mårlind","popularity":1.0483,"profile_path":"/ifL7bdaugE9BCxX1V7fgihjTWaN.jpg","credit_id":"69418dd4bfe51e5155244a40","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80923,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Måns Mårlind","original_name":"Måns Mårlind","popularity":1.0483,"profile_path":"/ifL7bdaugE9BCxX1V7fgihjTWaN.jpg","credit_id":"69418dd805eebad3c8244a3e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1173858,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Patrik Andersson","original_name":"Patrik Andersson","popularity":0.0647,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69418e06bfe51e5155244a4e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1517696,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jakob Abrahamsson","original_name":"Jakob Abrahamsson","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69418e10b20aa7b532331d54","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5881135,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jonna Lundin","original_name":"Jonna Lundin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69418e27c366e27da1509ca0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5322320,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cecilie Tidemann","original_name":"Cecilie Tidemann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69418e31c366e27da1509ca3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2232819,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Olivier Picard","original_name":"Olivier Picard","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69418e3cb20aa7b532331d5b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346222,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Louis Tisné","original_name":"Louis Tisné","popularity":0.0532,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69418e45f3a0036a3b0f5aa6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1493,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qx3xkU09jHTFsuj9dBDTqOdl0Ph.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1120}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
