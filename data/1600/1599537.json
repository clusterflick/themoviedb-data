After accidentally turning Grandfather George into a “Stuck Soul,” she must stay on Earth to help him finish his life mission. Living with his eccentric family — a spiritual dog, gothic teen Nikoleta, and fitness-obsessed Vita — she decides to explore human life and experience summer love. Instead of romance, she finds ghosting, sunburns, and beach days. But through it all, she discovers something greater: a deep love for living. She gives up immortality to live as a human — short, messy, but real.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":129929,"logo_path":"/7P9wTmmqVt2Rpla0Ym7TrLdZrg.png","name":"GS Animation","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Until Death Unites Us","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2805645,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nawojka Wierzbowska","original_name":"Nawojka Wierzbowska","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69420fda6cc581949f4e3cd0","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1888159,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Natalia Krawczuk","original_name":"Natalia Krawczuk","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69420fe20d3f3487c132a7f6","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5881995,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Maciej Lisek","original_name":"Maciej Lisek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69420fedb20e0b0ab8ab15b7","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5469998,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zuzanna Maszka","original_name":"Zuzanna Maszka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69420ff66d63b273504e3cd0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3055784,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert Jaszczurowski","original_name":"Robert Jaszczurowski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/mCjZR04ySPsBjv8bht9HiYMpuV9.jpg","credit_id":"6942100003803a19eb260e47","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
