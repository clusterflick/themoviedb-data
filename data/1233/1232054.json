The \"theoros\" undertook the journey on behalf of their community and, upon returning home, described what they had seen with their own eyes. With \"theoria\" the first step towards knowledge is seeing. With a hero's journey the return is as essential as embarking in the first placeâ€”through the act of leaving and then returning after the arduous journey the new is metabolized and the old is seen in a new light.
