He has been passionate about relic restoration but couldn’t find a related job for years. That has led to his disappointment in life. He routinely buys arts and history books but runs out of space to store them, irritating his parents who own the flat. Things started to change when a friend from the church and the film director came to his life. He felt like that his life was moving again at God’s will.","popularity":0.042,"poster_path":"/v915CyNUPGBSO2eu38crJ14WIyO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4484815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marina Qin","original_name":"Marina Qin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a6fdbd387651012a1a04fc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28349157","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":1511,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v915CyNUPGBSO2eu38crJ14WIyO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Buenos Aires Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2022-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"FIRST Film Festival","release_date":"2023-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
