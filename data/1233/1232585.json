Technology companies have been patenting gestures for many years - some of which we have been using for more than a decade. To navigate and communicate with the interface, users must inevitably learn these corporate-developed gestures and move their bodies accordingly. Just as gesture vocabulary is homogenized, monetized, and absorbed into private property, these patents lay claim to human movement-both by claiming existing gestures and by prophylactically claiming a broad range for possible future use.  Circumscribe shows the schematic drawings and diagrams from these same patents along with flocks of birds, also a network aud individuals reacting to each other. In the background we hear the dense atmosphere of city sounds, interspersed with network pings, notifications and signaling noises of typical platform apps.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Circumscribe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4486521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Leppert","original_name":"Laura Leppert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a84bbc7d2bc10133ea2551","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
