The cheerful old woman, who draws a cigarette with a mouthpiece, recalls her life: before the war she lived in Germany with her husband, after the war she was exiled to Siberia. Later, she was able to go back to Germany, but she returned to Šakininkai - to the land of her parents. Although the film focuses on Hilda's story, it also subtly invites us to consider the issues of multiethnicity and national identity of the inhabitants of Klaipėda Region. Hilda, who speaks with an accent, stubbornly calls herself a local: she was born here and is ready to spend her last days here.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/z9QnNn5YGP59AsSHzZ6znySerIJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Local","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2306535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kornelijus Matuzevičius","original_name":"Kornelijus Matuzevičius","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a704060c1255012bb53e92","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2306534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diana Matuzevičienė","original_name":"Diana Matuzevičienė","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a7041851c01f01256066d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2306534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diana Matuzevičienė","original_name":"Diana Matuzevičienė","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65aaa9f35346610131cd5213","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2306535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kornelijus Matuzevičius","original_name":"Kornelijus Matuzevičius","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65aaa9fe4557a0012d7e8aea","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2306535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kornelijus Matuzevičius","original_name":"Kornelijus Matuzevičius","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65aaaa554557a0012a7e8a55","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4489474,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Vida Misiūnienė","original_name":"Vida Misiūnienė","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65aaaa9c8d52c9013781ef4b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3569750","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z9QnNn5YGP59AsSHzZ6znySerIJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
