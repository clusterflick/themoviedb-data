After  learning that knitting was a significant way for women in the United States to  participate in the war effort during World War II. The repetitive nature of the hand  movement guiding the needles and stitching the wool thread distracts one from  pondering the past and future, locking the knitter into a timeless present. By staging  the practice in Yemen, Abdulaziz draws an embodied metaphor around the quotidian  experience of war—captive to the logic of survival—that inhibits projecting oneself  into a future of self-realization.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/kcokCyW30ka7rUMVEH4sZgPqI5Q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1941","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3925135,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Asim Abdulaziz","original_name":"Asim Abdulaziz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a9152d6f97460134d903f0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16425416","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1333,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kcokCyW30ka7rUMVEH4sZgPqI5Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
