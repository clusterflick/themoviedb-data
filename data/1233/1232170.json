They land at an open mic night in a New Jersey bar where Bobby’s aunt and uncle (once aspiring actors) lay out the realities of life as a working actor. The film was inspired by performers Savoca met while making her first student film, most notably William DaPrato. Filled with wry humor and quiet revelations about the pursuit of artistic dreams, Bad Timing also features Marianne Leone and the on-screen debut of future Academy Award winner Chris Cooper.","popularity":0.5848,"poster_path":"/6BlujzTOVEKBsMqXT8lPm2SDcAV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bad Timing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":170950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelly Cinnante","original_name":"Kelly Cinnante","popularity":0.1447,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65a715ef255dba0132b1fd52","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1223750,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marianne Leone Cooper","original_name":"Marianne Leone Cooper","popularity":0.1441,"profile_path":"/p2alWkAnhbwYSjOtbnEbrSgi3a.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65a715f5988afd012c950a84","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2955,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Cooper","original_name":"Chris Cooper","popularity":1.3623,"profile_path":"/j0sQDzaDlnNAdaYhy6HRRAFi22.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65a715ff6840cc0125ff5df8","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":93025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nancy Savoca","original_name":"Nancy Savoca","popularity":0.1477,"profile_path":"/7BkuX3MtvbX5jmKbYl3HZrHRxCp.jpg","credit_id":"65a7160e255dba0132b1fd5c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":93025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nancy Savoca","original_name":"Nancy Savoca","popularity":0.1477,"profile_path":"/7BkuX3MtvbX5jmKbYl3HZrHRxCp.jpg","credit_id":"65a7161aaa7898012e622bbb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sIGM3XQPR9zsuAaQe8V66k8tJbI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6BlujzTOVEKBsMqXT8lPm2SDcAV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
