Just a single monk, modest friar Heribáld, remains in the monastery. The historical satire is packed with humorous anachronisms: Heribáld’s pocket watch, for instance, is an hourglass that acts as an alarm clock, and the film’s crew are depicted in the credits wearing medieval costume on ornate historiated initials. The film’s sarcastic method of portrayal is also fully in evidence in the caricature puppet characters designed by Ottó Foky.","popularity":0.0377,"poster_path":"/rJoYpmoHPm7krazLtZER9UIOERw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1961-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Adventure of St. Gallen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2697924,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"István Imre","original_name":"István Imre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a9675671083a0137f08716","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2697924,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"István Imre","original_name":"István Imre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a96771c4f55201378e7943","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3427576","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rJoYpmoHPm7krazLtZER9UIOERw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":810}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hu","note":"","release_date":"1961-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
