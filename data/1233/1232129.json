Like all of us who go to the river and mountains with fly rod in hand, it’s hard to come back the same person. Wild places forever change us – imbedding a deep and spiritual reverence for things greater than ourselves. This western idea was the underpinnings to one of America’s best inventions – the National Park System. This is their story – a family’s blessing to work, live, and share one of the most beautiful river corridors anywhere in the world. A gift that has instilled an even greater passion to protect things “wild” for many generations to come.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/i4EKKxYhNTF8jhPAaP91LYp3u1g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Father Nature","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":758,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i4EKKxYhNTF8jhPAaP91LYp3u1g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":506}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
