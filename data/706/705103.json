Shortly before, we see images of a bombed school. In this film, the youngest and most innocent generation of Sudanese explains how it deals with the war that is tearing the country apart. Will the orphaned children avenge their murdered parents, or will they forgive the killers and start working on a new life? At any rate, these children's dreams for the future are anything but violent. One of them wants to learn English to be able to liberate his country, another wants to study to \"be something,\" a third wants to become president to bring total peace, and yet another simply wants to be like her grandmother. Despite all the atrocities they have witnessed, the children mainly want to rebuild things, to put an end to the destruction.","popularity":0.2439,"poster_path":"/p9FrZVFukYlcTGu3BKBBlakM4oS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":133994,"logo_path":null,"name":"Peter Jordan for Localfilms","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Different Kind of Gun","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2641484,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Jordan","original_name":"Peter Jordan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec069bf3d3557001ee38045","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2641484,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Jordan","original_name":"Peter Jordan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec069ae8e2e00002118fc59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p9FrZVFukYlcTGu3BKBBlakM4oS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":393,"name":"civil war"},{"id":1327,"name":"war crimes"},{"id":5951,"name":"sudan"},{"id":14546,"name":"massacre"},{"id":206886,"name":"south sudan"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Arabic\", \"english_name\"=>\"Arabic\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"ar\", \"native_name\"=>\"Arabic\"}","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Different Kind of Gun","key":"58813553","site":"Vimeo","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2013-02-03T08:58:32.000Z","id":"5ec06a8128723c002144cb05"}]}}}
