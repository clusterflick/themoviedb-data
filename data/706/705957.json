The way up to the building led through “the meadow” where there were animals grazing, and the prison itself was surrounded with flowers. The place seemed eminently liveable, almost comfortable, and at first sight there was no sign of the silent struggle going on behind those walls. This documentary is an attempt to reconstruct life at the prison through the testimony of some of the hundreds of women who were there and who resisted the military regime's attempts to grind them down and destroy them.","popularity":0.3816,"poster_path":"/zwS0SDG3wJR9xpPdxfzOUB4n1zu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2005-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Women's Memoirs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3186691,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rosario Caticha","original_name":"Rosario Caticha","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610b2ecaee43e8005e428eb0","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3186692,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charna Furman","original_name":"Charna Furman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610b2edcdcf87500303a675e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3186693,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Isabel Trivelli","original_name":"Isabel Trivelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610b2ee8eea34d002d484bc5","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3181033,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Melina Sícalos","original_name":"Melina Sícalos","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610b2ef99f5dfb0046828137","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2326642,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Diego Varela","original_name":"Diego Varela","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610b2f06eea34d0073138465","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2326642,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Diego Varela","original_name":"Diego Varela","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610b2f0cee43e80027ce2db4","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3154304,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alvaro Mechoso","original_name":"Alvaro Mechoso","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610b2f18eea34d00463debae","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1167726,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jorge García","original_name":"Jorge García","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610b2f259f5dfb005ebfbdf5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1607249,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Yafalián","original_name":"Daniel Yafalián","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/9sT6KdnxVX2IsepTqpfdQRqwVXC.jpg","credit_id":"610b2f2f1bf87600759cf82e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1477439,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Virginia Martínez","original_name":"Virginia Martínez","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec335da18b7510020c9e544","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sblTaUxnITvb6lc1I6A6FWl4Tpq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zwS0SDG3wJR9xpPdxfzOUB4n1zu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":7992,"name":"uruguay"},{"id":156887,"name":"military dictatorship"},{"id":256736,"name":"latin america"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2005-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
