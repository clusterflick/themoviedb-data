In front of 50,000 adoring fans, Joe Calzaghe delivered a Millennium Stadium master-class - a furious, fabulous performance of pace, power and electric intensity to unify the World super middleweight division. To do it Calzaghe had to rip the WBC and WBA belts from unbeaten Dane Mikkel Kessler. Both men went to war in a quite breathtaking 12 rounds of nerve-shredding excitement. The blurring hand speed of Calzaghe proved decisive as he took his unbeaten record to 44 fights - 21 of them world title defences! In his decade of dominance, Calzaghe has never had to dig so deep.  Kessler was class but the judges? scorecards confirmed the undeniable excellence of the Welsh warrior. The judges scored it: John Stewart (USA) 116-112 Massimo BarrovecchIo (Italy) 116-112 Raul Caiz (USA) 117-111 The result was unanimous - Calzaghe was the better man he always is!","popularity":0.1478,"poster_path":"/xAFWHaKv9YqAJCEjvYxzobpBI1O.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joe Calzaghe Vs Mikkel Kessler","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":532667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Calzaghe","original_name":"Joe Calzaghe","popularity":0.1598,"profile_path":"/kBaV7TzRDtwQ2gGMtyB1azjhdbj.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62673913ce6c4c00662d2c97","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1545088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikkel Kessler","original_name":"Mikkel Kessler","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/lCArpYsQhSIc7XPjCbv5Y0Bt8VP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62673926eda4b70168fd5422","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1688,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dayywviP8tC7BJJxwwopl1NThin.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1322,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xAFWHaKv9YqAJCEjvYxzobpBI1O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":938}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Night of the fight.","release_date":"2007-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
