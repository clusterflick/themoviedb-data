Highland Fling tells the story of James, a young Glaswegian who is lured from his nuptial bed by an unearthly siren. As his love for this beautiful ‘Sylph’ becomes an obsession, he embarks on a journey that takes him from the mean streets and nightclubs of Glasgow into a magical world beyond.  This gothic fable of winged fairies and kilted ladies - filled with all the wild excesses of romanticism - has been given an ingenious make-over by Matthew Bourne’s New Adventures and is packed with all their trademark wit, magic and wicked humour.","popularity":0.2375,"poster_path":"/nIXoIG48VHYkeVHtuWa30NguDXb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Romantic Wee Ballet","title":"Highland Fling","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2643938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Horler","original_name":"Grace Horler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Madge","credit_id":"5ec2dab2ce5d82001c2db50b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2643940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barnaby Rook Bishop","original_name":"Barnaby Rook Bishop","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"James","credit_id":"5ec2db0bcdf2e600214ff1d9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2643941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roseanna Leney","original_name":"Roseanna Leney","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Effie","credit_id":"5ec2db29cdf2e60022517887","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2643942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amy Mcentee","original_name":"Amy Mcentee","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Sylph","credit_id":"5ec2dbbdce5d82001c2db59e","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1137227,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Matthew Bourne","original_name":"Matthew Bourne","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/kVEos64fJY16rAimttIIY9FcGVw.jpg","credit_id":"5ec2d9e86dea3a001cf7b13c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":230929,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Lez Brotherston","original_name":"Lez Brotherston","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec2da013d3557001ce4b32d","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2643936,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Herman Severin Løvenskjold","original_name":"Herman Severin Løvenskjold","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec2da5428723c002048db9a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1187147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Etta Murfitt","original_name":"Etta Murfitt","popularity":0.0766,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec2da2d18b751001fc92ebc","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":230929,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Lez Brotherston","original_name":"Lez Brotherston","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec2da0f18b751001fc92eac","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1897657,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Paule Constable","original_name":"Paule Constable","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec2da1ace5d82001b2dc2f3","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1137227,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Matthew Bourne","original_name":"Matthew Bourne","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/kVEos64fJY16rAimttIIY9FcGVw.jpg","credit_id":"5ec2d9f68e2e0000211e63c1","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1878337,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Groothuis","original_name":"Paul Groothuis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec2da3e9979d2002132fba0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cM1uPJFRCBNd7w4IChGa8f7X9mW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nIXoIG48VHYkeVHtuWa30NguDXb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":849}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
