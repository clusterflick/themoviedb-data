In 16 short but precious minutes you will see what the village of Galichnik, the famous Galichnik wedding and our ancestors looked like 80 years ago – in color! – very unusual at that time. Maybe some of you will recognize your great-grandfather, great-great-grandmother, old family house, alley, tree, entrance door. Sifrid Miladinov’s film is a rare opportunity to look back in the past through authentic, original archive footage. We thank the descendants of this film enthusiast, the Miladinovi family from Zagreb, for depositing the film in our national film archive – the Cinematheque – several years ago.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/fT7XEfbwu4OGV4G7ixn3IQqwkFa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1940-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Galičnik","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2644741,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sifrid Miladinov","original_name":"Sifrid Miladinov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62fe8b28efe37c007f012d0a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2644741,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sifrid Miladinov","original_name":"Sifrid Miladinov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec3d84a140bad001d15769e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6856912","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":1040,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fT7XEfbwu4OGV4G7ixn3IQqwkFa.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":740}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1940-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
