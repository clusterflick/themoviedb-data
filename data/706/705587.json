Some say the results of the restoration are glorious. Others have called them tragic.  Da Vinci’s famously fragile fresco was always going to be a challenge for its secretive Italian restorers. No one, however, could have foreseen how problematic and strange their task would become. Marked by a series of extraordinary mishaps, mistakes, and miscalculations, the incredible restoration is hilarious to watch but may have resulted in the loss of a masterpiece.","popularity":0.3868,"poster_path":"/6h5tdUclvYQoXdYlw4Tn2VnKRWE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81680,"logo_path":null,"name":"ZCZ Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1998-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lost Supper","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Waldemar Januszczak","original_name":"Waldemar Januszczak","popularity":0.2016,"profile_path":"/uiwR6ajxnLL7FSATFsUcerVxDe4.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self - Narrator","credit_id":"5ec1e92b9979d2001f2f47a9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1140481,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Lerner","original_name":"Mike Lerner","popularity":0.0916,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6503285863aad2013800221a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2643012,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Colin Spector","original_name":"Colin Spector","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec1e98828723c0020478203","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Waldemar Januszczak","original_name":"Waldemar Januszczak","popularity":0.2016,"profile_path":"/uiwR6ajxnLL7FSATFsUcerVxDe4.jpg","credit_id":"5ec1e7f74e52ed001f3764c3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2586958","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lZgBihkBIK20Mz9YlLMFBpbFkRx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6h5tdUclvYQoXdYlw4Tn2VnKRWE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2967,"name":"leonardo da vinci"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":217115,"name":"art restoration"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Channel 4 \"Arthouse\"","release_date":"1998-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Lost Supper - Trailer","key":"399120143","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-03-20T17:14:32.000Z","id":"650327ee1bf26600c5d72667"}]}}}
