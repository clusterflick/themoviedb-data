It’s where he met his best friends. It’s where he takes to the stage in the big musical. And it’s where he fell for Hudson Aaronson-Lim – who’s only into straight-acting guys and barely knows not-at-all-straight-acting Randy even exists. Randy reinvents himself over the summer as ‘Del, a buff, masculine, and on the market camper. Even if it means giving up show tunes, nail polish, and his unicorn bedsheets, he’s determined to get Hudson to fall for him. But as he and Hudson grow closer, Randy has to ask himself how much he is willing to change for love. And is it really love anyway, if Hudson doesn’t know who he truly is?","popularity":0.3102,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Rumored","tagline":"","title":"Camp","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Porter","original_name":"Billy Porter","popularity":0.7494,"profile_path":"/3BrMhoTURtBpbPZjNxYILmxfqJP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mark","credit_id":"617838b3e9da69002b9d2f0d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Porter","original_name":"Billy Porter","popularity":0.7494,"profile_path":"/3BrMhoTURtBpbPZjNxYILmxfqJP.jpg","credit_id":"617838c9a097dc0065f4ff55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2643765,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lev Rosen","original_name":"Lev Rosen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec2bbbbcdf2e60020506649","department":"Writing","job":"Book"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1055540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kit Williamson","original_name":"Kit Williamson","popularity":0.1105,"profile_path":"/dpsgs7ud2GVnirNSSSIXyeA0hJ.jpg","credit_id":"5efe30729dee580038cfb7db","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12611870","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
