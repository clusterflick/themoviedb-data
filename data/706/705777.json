Using the objects at their disposal and the inspiration surrounding them, artists such as George Rickey, Claes Oldenburg, and Louise Nevelson cast sculptor in a new light. The New World observes the sculptors creatively utilizing wood, metals, and junkyard finds, bringing forth lively and shocking work. America's remote spaces, discarded objects and abundant materials enabled them to add to the concepts of European modernism in daringly unique ways.","popularity":0.2239,"poster_path":"/xONwJIVxJD7n7i5qsDIMzM8PLAW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70445,"logo_path":null,"name":"Michael Blackwood Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Masters of Modern Sculpture Part III: The New World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1046490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christo","original_name":"Christo","popularity":0.1022,"profile_path":"/l97vImuBfnjVIb9nHsHqNiJ9PTX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"himself","credit_id":"5ec2a2928e2e0000211dfa06","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1299084,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Isamu Noguchi","original_name":"Isamu Noguchi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"himself","credit_id":"5ec2a2a018b7510020c8f3e9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1337444,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Serra","original_name":"Richard Serra","popularity":0.1498,"profile_path":"/aIKTeQv73Jhzz8qnK7Ap0GL7JYm.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"himself","credit_id":"5ec2a33018b7510020c8f4c5","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1264965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Blackwood","original_name":"Michael Blackwood","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":"/8R0NnxYVOuWqX5PvIvA0vmmLqh5.jpg","credit_id":"5ec2a2488e2e0000211df987","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1847643","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xONwJIVxJD7n7i5qsDIMzM8PLAW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6024,"name":"sculpture"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
