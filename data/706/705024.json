These escapes in the past have included dime store novels. The most accessible of these escapes is what are known as the funny papers, the set of serialized comic strips that are included within many newspapers. They appeal to all socio-economic classes, and all ages. Some of the earliest known from the late 19th century include the Yellow Kid, Little Nemo, Happy Hooligan, the Katzenjammer Kids, Mutt & Jeff, and Bringing Up Father. Many cartoonists are seen in action. Some originated their characters, while others have taken over following the passing of the originator. The joy of many comic strips are the absurd and the fantastical, which are limited only by the imagination of the cartoonist. Others are grounded in reality, which add to their poignancy within the public mindset.","popularity":0.7986,"poster_path":"/vM87Z2XVEecJlOVxmBMlMArih9u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1945-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"People on Paper","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":167922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Nesbitt","original_name":"John Nesbitt","popularity":0.1696,"profile_path":"/yKGHIGmZ1Lr1pYvpDmBPcOqm0nB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5ec01e6e6d675a00207d6425","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1238714,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chester Gould","original_name":"Chester Gould","popularity":0.0569,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ec01ea3d2147c0023b25949","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":68858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al Capp","original_name":"Al Capp","popularity":0.1737,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ec01ec18e2e00001f13fbd8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34172,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chic Young","original_name":"Chic Young","popularity":0.1311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ec01ed4d2147c0023b25a4a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4039513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"H.H.
