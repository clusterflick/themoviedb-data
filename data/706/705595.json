A faceless snowman thrives in winter's starkness. There is frost and winter light. A glass light-catcher radiates color. Passing trains. Flame and smoke rise from a barrel. Fragments of music. Somewhere someone is picking out phrases from Randall Thompson's 'Alleluia'. A lot goes on, but not much happens. It is winter. Finally the snowman announces the coming of spring, and the piano plays its closing chords.\" â€”Abbott Meader","popularity":0.1994,"poster_path":"/3dpEY1zBAOc1e4BRfJmzbEIF8gJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Winter Li","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2409926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abbott Meader","original_name":"Abbott Meader","popularity":0.0776,"profile_path":"/6w2FYubuteabfg5UVNDEHraRTve.jpg","credit_id":"5ec1ef44cdf2e600224f8483","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11028682","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p0VCrNLXIiAi2GjCWGxjhQBqmwC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3dpEY1zBAOc1e4BRfJmzbEIF8gJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1442,"name":"winter"},{"id":10794,"name":"snow"},{"id":155488,"name":"black cat"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Winter Li  (1981)","key":"353025639","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2019-08-09T21:51:22.000Z","id":"5ec1ef7acdf2e600204f48dd"}]}}}
