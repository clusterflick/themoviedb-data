One day after you disappeared, after you sent that break-up message, I made you this video letter. A day after the military took power. In a matter of a day, you and I lost us, and we all lost a revolution. I am not angry, I am disappointed. But how does one live disappointment? What is the physical action associated with disappointment? Anger is much easier. Sadness is much easier. Hatred is the easiest. But I don’t hate you. You are too innocent to hate. We were too innocent to win. It is life.","popularity":0.2293,"poster_path":"/gBW4y58P6lspc0sK2PtnsbLfVz9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Breakup in 9 Scenes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2644347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramón Manas Jarmil","original_name":"Ramón Manas Jarmil","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ec33ffdd2147c0023b8d665","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2644348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Mitsopoulou","original_name":"Maria Mitsopoulou","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ec340083d3557001ee99472","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2644352,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Katharina Voss","original_name":"Katharina Voss","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec3406dce5d82001d2e2a02","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2644349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leil-Zahra Mortada","original_name":"Leil-Zahra Mortada","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec3401e3d3557001ce51e33","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2644349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leil-Zahra Mortada","original_name":"Leil-Zahra Mortada","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec340159979d200202ee3f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2084623,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Rima Najdi","original_name":"Rima Najdi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec3402bd2147c0023b8d6ce","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2611175,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Zara Zandieh","original_name":"Zara Zandieh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec3404d9979d2001f31085b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2644351,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gizem Oruç","original_name":"Gizem Oruç","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec3405ece5d82001b2e6603","department":"Sound","job":"Location Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1302277,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kathy Alberici","original_name":"Kathy Alberici","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec3407b9979d2001f310869","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2644350,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Salma Rafiq-Hayat","original_name":"Salma Rafiq-Hayat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec340388e2e0000201afd3d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tQmjvgq0uboIe95USOxxeKhMNd4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gBW4y58P6lspc0sK2PtnsbLfVz9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14534,"name":"relationship"},{"id":14602,"name":"break-up"},{"id":173259,"name":"arab"},{"id":250606,"name":"queer"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Teaser: Breakup in 9 Scenes","key":"365568095","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2019-10-10T16:33:12.000Z","id":"5ec33fd92dffd8002270c55f"}]}}}
