The Suape Complex controls the region and through its #miliciasuape it has been intimidating, expelling and removing the local populations. A carpenter, Mr. Biu has fabricated tables for years; in her project made for “Convocatória para um Mobiliário Brasileiro” (“Open Call for a Brazilian Furniture”) an installation at the MASP (Art Museu of São Paulo), the artist Carla Lombardo dubbed these tables as “Gentrificada” (“Gentrified”). The movie builds a regime of visualization with technical images that invite us to think about representation and orientation in a world of data.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/npCCLkp5rLbJCMdOg73DMyXdDzG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2017-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seu Biu, Meu Atlas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2643604,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"SSS South Small Sister","original_name":"SSS South Small Sister","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec295d33d3557001ee878e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o4X7EL2kMHgLujrfRIsj5CTYtuZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/npCCLkp5rLbJCMdOg73DMyXdDzG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"YouTube","release_date":"2017-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Istanbul International Experimental Film Festival","release_date":"2020-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
