The Champion, in the title, is a Great Dane who has won the title at the Rubeville State Fair, and it isn't long before the Champion turns up dead, which is because somebody---motive unknown at the moment---has killed the Champion. This is repeated at other shows along the way and Quade's bright young assistant, \"Small Fry\", fancies himself as an amateur detective, and starts nosing around into the mystery and drags Quade along with him.","popularity":0.8702,"poster_path":"/b3of7hBu6jzchdlmfJKFRqN29wN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1939-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Death of a Champion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lynne Overman","original_name":"Lynne Overman","popularity":0.2267,"profile_path":"/8Rrh7yqDWhAskgPsNvR7sViBX3z.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Oliver Quade","credit_id":"5dc2945d470ead00188bf21d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":131001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Dale","original_name":"Virginia Dale","popularity":0.119,"profile_path":"/h2Py6AD7EEWukFTAVYsax9ljwX7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Patsy Doyle","credit_id":"5dc2946d9d8939001533950b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Allen","original_name":"Joseph Allen","popularity":0.0798,"profile_path":"/cKpoFQYaPgPgH1yssggszTykmMq.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Richie Oakes","credit_id":"5dc2947e7d2bc100173b8487","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13295,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald O'Connor","original_name":"Donald O'Connor","popularity":0.5852,"profile_path":"/sV7Dx16wcajPsxJItmW5dX4axoW.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Small Fry","credit_id":"5dc2948d9d89390015339524","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2450374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Paley","original_name":"Susan Paley","popularity":0.0721,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Lois Lanyard","credit_id":"5dc2949e7d2bc100133ba601","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11502,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Davenport","original_name":"Harry Davenport","popularity":0.1936,"profile_path":"/7W2oWsYrSUroKuTom0cz9qAOAfD.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Guy Lanyard","credit_id":"5dc294b09d89390015339563","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Paige","original_name":"Robert Paige","popularity":0.2654,"profile_path":"/3ZwsxO24hm19O73gKIeJbYdbELJ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Alec Temple","credit_id":"5dc294be470ead00188bf2c1","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Florey","original_name":"Robert Florey","popularity":0.3391,"profile_path":"/cRX6qkTniwyr1Kt0yTWIlqHO25F.jpg","credit_id":"5dc28bfc9d89390015338531","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88974,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frank Gruber","original_name":"Frank Gruber","popularity":0.2185,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60005228420228003de96cc9","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":117693,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stuart Palmer","original_name":"Stuart Palmer","popularity":0.1095,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600052347390c0003bf5cc3e","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121105,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cortland Fitzsimmons","original_name":"Cortland Fitzsimmons","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6000523f7390c0003df59085","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0031221","wikidata_id":"Q5247558","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/payrOLmeXHCYzmRtEVgGvE1U2bW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/b3of7hBu6jzchdlmfJKFRqN29wN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15162,"name":"dog"},{"id":162843,"name":"state fair"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1939-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
