When the Greek police closed the camp, the refugees resisted and blocked a railway line used to deliver goods. Maria Kourkouta’s minimalist documentary not only observes these events but also presents carefully modeled static images that open up the space within and without the frame of view, and in the closing black-and-white sequence offers a poetic commentary. The result is a bleak portrait of a place where endless lines of refugees try to preserve the final remnants of their individual freedoms.  “This film is a call to welcome the refugees that cross the European borders, as well as the ghosts that return with them.”","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":"/zNSBS8CNgt5E72QIUWmUmxNMyFh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87779,"logo_path":null,"name":"Survivance","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2018-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spectres are Haunting Europe","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Fantásmata planioýntai páno apó tīn Evrópī","type":"Romanization of Greek title"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Des spectres hantent l'Europe","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1737138,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niki Giannari","original_name":"Niki Giannari","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"587690869251410f41001031","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1431103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Kourkouta","original_name":"Maria Kourkouta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/6CCIk8Jq25c7Myi9AeOneVo10Dv.jpg","credit_id":"587691069251410f3d0010a8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1431103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Kourkouta","original_name":"Maria Kourkouta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/6CCIk8Jq25c7Myi9AeOneVo10Dv.jpg","credit_id":"587690929251410f3d00106a","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1737140,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"André Fèvre","original_name":"André Fèvre","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"587690dfc3a3682d17000fff","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1431103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Kourkouta","original_name":"Maria Kourkouta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/6CCIk8Jq25c7Myi9AeOneVo10Dv.jpg","credit_id":"5876906b9251410f47000fe4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1431103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Kourkouta","original_name":"Maria Kourkouta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/6CCIk8Jq25c7Myi9AeOneVo10Dv.jpg","credit_id":"587690a59251410f4c000fa0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1431103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Kourkouta","original_name":"Maria Kourkouta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/6CCIk8Jq25c7Myi9AeOneVo10Dv.jpg","credit_id":"587690c69251410f41001059","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1737141,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lena Platonos","original_name":"Lena Platonos","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/5xBiys2FgUcN1TJF08QIYZz5ZsE.jpg","credit_id":"587690f1c3a3682d24000ffd","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1737138,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niki Giannari","original_name":"Niki Giannari","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5876907a9251410f4c000f86","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1737142,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carine Chichkowsky","original_name":"Carine Chichkowsky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"587691179251410f34001098","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6497630","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.724,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zNSBS8CNgt5E72QIUWmUmxNMyFh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":724}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
