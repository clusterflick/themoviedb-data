The thoughts of the saxophonist Charles Gayle and the bass players William Parker and Peter Kowald from Germany accompany the film. Shot on 16 mm, this film remains one of a kind until today. Some of the recorded musicians have passed away - their spirits live on.","popularity":0.0504,"poster_path":"/7iQRybIxv0K2sXzQYFS95vYYm0G.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1985-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rising Tones Cross","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1013860,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Zorn","original_name":"John Zorn","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/ob7GSs2RWomOzFgrK0o8e2jOxAJ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5877c2179251411041009bf5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1737735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David S.
