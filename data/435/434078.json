Thérèse lives alone in Paris. We exiled her there. She seems to be asking nothing more for life. She is sick and lives in slow motion. One day, we ring rue du Bac. It is Mary, her daughter, whom she sees so little. She is twenty years old now and comes to see her to escape her middle-class south-west. She is very in love with a boy, she expects from her mother a support, a freedom of point of view. His name is Murad. The arrival of her daughter awakens Therese with her reserve and torpor. It does not shock Mary, who is very busy with her love. Thérèse proposes to meet Mourad. She quickly understands that he is not willing to marry Mary but wants her without wanting to bond more deeply to her. It is she Therese, that the young man looks ... She wanted to help her daughter to be happy, a wish too official not to be suspicious. Here she is delivered to the power of her own seduction ...","popularity":0.4203,"poster_path":"/zJmm6qsM2fTKT9i3tuLSo6XX5rM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La fin de la nuit","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":24485,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Garcia","original_name":"Nicole Garcia","popularity":0.5807,"profile_path":"/kZWBVMLkxGhH97DgJ0uoUlSF5Z5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Thérèse Desqueyroux","credit_id":"587350c09251410e6b0077fa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cyril Descours","original_name":"Cyril Descours","popularity":0.1333,"profile_path":"/r8VkfR8sey5AEO4i8AvbJEbM8YG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Thomas Pian","credit_id":"587350c9c3a368177000881b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":78216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Bourgoin","original_name":"Louise Bourgoin","popularity":0.9847,"profile_path":"/n83zu056tAm0wXHVrNk3khr8Gm4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Marie Desqueyroux","credit_id":"587350d1c3a3681746007509","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1004579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Mazzinghi","original_name":"Bernard Mazzinghi","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":"/lrvaXWzOEODvO6pSJ1KOAkjKo0c.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Bernard Desqueyroux","credit_id":"587350d9c3a3681731006d5d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1356667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandra Nkake","original_name":"Sandra Nkake","popularity":0.0798,"profile_path":"/2SrfVe6yZZ6jWf5z3qG17aK8wmU.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Nanda","credit_id":"61c60a5c33ad8f006bc9387e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1558155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amir el Kacem","original_name":"Amir el Kacem","popularity":0.2257,"profile_path":"/khRz4zgcf0aZKa7hHnRzwlfcnvv.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mourad Guerfa","credit_id":"587350ea9251410e77007afb","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25854,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucas Belvaux","original_name":"Lucas Belvaux","popularity":0.2181,"profile_path":"/qwUz2r8RPRjWPwwvHIc9RN1t30V.jpg","credit_id":"587350799251410e73007d76","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25854,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucas Belvaux","original_name":"Lucas Belvaux","popularity":0.2181,"profile_path":"/qwUz2r8RPRjWPwwvHIc9RN1t30V.jpg","credit_id":"5a74abe392514105a9021ff7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23506,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jacques Fieschi","original_name":"Jacques Fieschi","popularity":0.2591,"profile_path":"/kMrQl31GtC97HbXwvcTFAWGzyUh.jpg","credit_id":"5a74abcfc3a36859cf021e69","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1049252,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"François Mauriac","original_name":"François Mauriac","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a74aba1c3a3685a1b0236cd","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6423016","wikidata_id":"Q28497216","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/zJmm6qsM2fTKT9i3tuLSo6XX5rM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
