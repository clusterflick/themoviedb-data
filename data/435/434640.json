A tree over 20 meters tall rips out and tumbles down. It is the first of the more than 100 trees that Robinson and his family, with nothing but axes, are about to chop down, chop up and drag over an improvised path to a nearby stream, and from there to the large Anchicayá River. There, in the river waters, they tie up all the pieces for form a huge raft, on which they embark on a titanic journey that lasts over forty hours, overcoming the river torrents and the choppy waters of the Pacific Ocean. They finally arrive at the Port of Buenaventura, where after several months of tireless work, they sell the wood and complete a feat that demonstrates the never-ending search of humanity: survival.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"2014-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Travesía","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1737565,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexander González Tascón","original_name":"Alexander González Tascón","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58778962c3a36850f8006d12","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1737565,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexander González Tascón","original_name":"Alexander González Tascón","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"587c06aac3a368426e007608","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4251010","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
