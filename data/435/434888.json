He plays an old peasant who on his deathbed is waiting for his son (Jon Bang Carlsen). In a few days he relives the village life, he comes from, and which was marked by a hard and authoritarian upbringing. He is at his father's deathbed despair because it is still impossible to make contact, and in a crisis situation, he recognizes his father's brutality in itself. The film draws a bitter picture of human relationships where dreams while they die, degenerates into power relations.","popularity":0.3557,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":48007,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dagmar Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1979-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dreams Don't Make Noise When They Die","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":579027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kai Holm","original_name":"Kai Holm","popularity":0.0532,"profile_path":"/biRtEgYApH8EUWZTOHeXLqS5nak.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Kresten, Eriks far","credit_id":"591c34dbc3a368723d009b44","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Stegger","original_name":"Karl Stegger","popularity":0.1806,"profile_path":"/yIBcWpxsPoX9xugAA4hCmXn92Cq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hurtig-Karl","credit_id":"591c34f3c3a368723d009b56","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1172089,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Bang Carlsen","original_name":"Jon Bang Carlsen","popularity":0.0663,"profile_path":"/qwPxGQ6IKuW7gt6JB034CKkHXtj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Erik, politiker","credit_id":"591c3564c3a368723d009bb2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irm Hermann","original_name":"Irm Hermann","popularity":0.1783,"profile_path":"/4NzeDGGAqq0Aw8QpqTuOAu7DkeN.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Margit, Eriks kone","credit_id":"591c35c792514149f300949a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1818507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Holger Nederby","original_name":"Holger Nederby","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/t8GOxSKNXbJcUjz7ffQE0wsinGs.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ras","credit_id":"591c36a9c3a3687a640095f6","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1319715,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Braad Thomsen","original_name":"Christian Braad Thomsen","popularity":0.0913,"profile_path":"/zUr1PgDziuFF5q2eVF1i4g4CXWr.jpg","credit_id":"58793e319251410c060014c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0129050","wikidata_id":"Q12309021","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":34079,"name":"death"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"da","note":"","release_date":"1979-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
