It is not an Armenia based in a reality but one, which appears, like the mythical city of Shangri-La, when ones eyes are closed. A mesh of traditional images 'engraved' in film, with haunting voice-over, and rich colors, music and rhythms that continues long after the film is over. The viewers are engaged and forced through unchartered landscapes of uncertainty and fascination.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":"/yuS0BhAXZvMbR8Gs0f77Ql3abVE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1994-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Girl from Moush","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1525729,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gariné Torossian","original_name":"Gariné Torossian","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c7a86599251412a664a6bab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0144219","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1181,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cGWmxed1LXEblS2U9zBwxj5lVud.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2100},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1131,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/16cYvgIwgGoHCb9uoiZmK73QxyG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2010},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1169,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rx4td12XoXacLDfbTNHtPWRy864.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2078},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1146,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nkMr5HwOwy4643dlKWyuuEeNtuc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2038},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1173,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nZ8h8VEgdglCZMvBRWxc3X92tO3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2086}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":996,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yuS0BhAXZvMbR8Gs0f77Ql3abVE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":664}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Source: MUBI (Berlin)","release_date":"1994-02-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
