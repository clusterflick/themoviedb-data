Without occupying himself in advance with anticipated images,  he attempted as often as  spontaneously as possible to respond and react to his surroundings, improvising with the camera as one would on a musical instrument.  These visual notes allow insights into perceptions, feelings and emotional states in various situations.","popularity":0.1146,"poster_path":"/6bVUUia5a93TPvYSDea4xMdF7Qk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1985-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Notations in Image and Sound","title":"Eastern Avenue","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Eastern Avenue: Notations in Image and Sound","type":"video box title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":985032,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Mettler","original_name":"Peter Mettler","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/cJeAJKcMdVOhAz8Pk5QZITIuw6P.jpg","credit_id":"5874ac999251414496003cc9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":985032,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Mettler","original_name":"Peter Mettler","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/cJeAJKcMdVOhAz8Pk5QZITIuw6P.jpg","credit_id":"596215dfc3a3680d590ac342","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":985032,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Mettler","original_name":"Peter Mettler","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/cJeAJKcMdVOhAz8Pk5QZITIuw6P.jpg","credit_id":"596215e9c3a36828fc0c1856","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0145760","wikidata_id":"Q88872536","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":844,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iZAotzc5hl8TY4c0nvnihepokri.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6bVUUia5a93TPvYSDea4xMdF7Qk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
