Driving over 7,000 miles from Los Angeles to New York over the course of 30 days, the documentary spotlights 17 positive and powerful women leaders across a variety of lifestyles and industries. Along the way, these filmmakers relay the candid insight on how these women define their success, what it takes to be a woman in their position, and valuable advice on how to improve the female role in the workplace. In celebration of the all-female focus in front of and behind the camera, the filmmakers turned the cameras on themselves, capturing their transformational journey. Created for women by women, they challenge the audience to ask themselves, \"What would you do if you weren't afraid to fail?\"","popularity":0.119,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Empowerment Project: Ordinary Women Doing Extraordinary Things","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1738487,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sarah Moshman","original_name":"Sarah Moshman","popularity":0.088,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58795eba925141549c000ac7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1738487,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sarah Moshman","original_name":"Sarah Moshman","popularity":0.088,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58795ec2925141549f000ac0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3574924","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
