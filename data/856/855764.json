He is a quiet person, disinterested in life, with no social interaction - whether with customers at the stall, or with his family at home. For some time, he has been noticing a male couple, who have become regular customers at his tea stall. Their casual behaviour makes him very disturbed and angry. One day, this anger manifests as a violent reaction, leaving Ehsan in a mix of guilt and nostalgia.","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":"/ipuBnyB1TpkYHfnhVpPTIPAhPAi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Beloved","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3178525,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Salman Alam Khan","original_name":"Salman Alam Khan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6103a7a72a210c002b3bb33b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13859550","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ipuBnyB1TpkYHfnhVpPTIPAhPAi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
