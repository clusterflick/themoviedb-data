Thousands of farmers in the northeastern liberated areas voluntarily joined the migrant workers' brigade and headed forward in heavy snow. Tian Yongtai, who was in his fifties, rushed to the front line to lift the wounded, but the village chief could not stop him. Before setting off, he was worried about paying public food, so he asked his youngest son to drive the sledge to pick up his second daughter-in-law. The eldest daughter-in-law had a lovely son. She rushed to deliver public food and asked the second daughter-in-law to hold the child at home. The two sisters-in-law had an argument and asked their father-in-law to write a letter to Tian Erhu who was on the front line.","popularity":0.0798,"poster_path":"/2p8iFT5BjToFbEviP0dP027VQL1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1950-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"光荣人家","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2655383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuezhi Sun","original_name":"Yuezhi Sun","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/h1RthH82tZjaN9uzeMnG1oclxoP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"小三子","credit_id":"61036b978d1b8e0047c4ede7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2197099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Li Xiaogong","original_name":"Li Xiaogong","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/kKgleL0LqwaD0kEShy4qSMUlUUe.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"二儿媳","credit_id":"61036ba08d1b8e002a6a519b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1910867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Huang Ling","original_name":"Huang Ling","popularity":0.0682,"profile_path":"/7z0cKbAkwOScSdSatWostvtxgkh.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"大儿媳","credit_id":"61036baad207f30046561bf9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2936098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ling Xiao","original_name":"Ling Xiao","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"大个子","credit_id":"61036bb58a0e9b007e9b2424","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1282007,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ling Zifeng","original_name":"Ling Zifeng","popularity":0.1058,"profile_path":"/izbc3poOlxnnZYLB3cHdLVxTagP.jpg","credit_id":"61036b8c8ee49c004655e766","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2p8iFT5BjToFbEviP0dP027VQL1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"1950-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
