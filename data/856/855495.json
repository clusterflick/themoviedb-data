Once again, Doris Chase has not merely documented the performance but transformed it into what she describes as a \"moving painting.\" Through special color video effects of feedback, de-beaming and superimposition, she creates an evocative visual interpretation of the dance. We see the dancer from different points of view simultaneously overlapped, most often contrasting close-up and full figure shots.","popularity":0.0637,"poster_path":"/aUlVwdKM0JUEJ315Tf1o3aXC8te.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dance 7","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406509,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Doris Chase","original_name":"Doris Chase","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6102dc827d5f4b002d9f4597","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":968,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aUlVwdKM0JUEJ315Tf1o3aXC8te.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":645}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
