I longed to play with the color of film at its last gasp. I wanted to understand the relationship with the celluloid color timer (RIP) essential for the answer print. In so doing, I learned the relationship was Talmudic, at best, like going to an Ophthalmologist (in failing sight) and hoping she listens to me as I tell her which lens works better. And chemicals and performances intervene. Innocence is lost. Yet the representation of light, color, nature, shadows, and a shaky camera, persist. The seeming audacity of pure “perception” is but a moment of silent meditation.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/a2S0dZKG08qhiWJZpivQafg2sdD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Color Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2924118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elizabeth Block","original_name":"Elizabeth Block","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6101a48e0a517c0073013e92","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a2S0dZKG08qhiWJZpivQafg2sdD.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":3,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uF7RzBUfssxhBztrNd7B8cugECX.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":3,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
