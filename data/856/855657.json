Angels and Saints are, then, the incarnation of this compassionate and deeply sensual Spirit -- our contemporary “messengers of awe.”","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/s2l3k7UVy4fvBlKp7aQMBCzEjlj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Angels and Saints - Eros and Awe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3178192,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vic Compher","original_name":"Vic Compher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610344d5a217c00029db2e5a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/s2l3k7UVy4fvBlKp7aQMBCzEjlj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
