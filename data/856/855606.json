The organizers and the participants use it as an opportunity to gather once a week - their only day off - as well as to redefine their position as migrant working women in Cypriot society and reclaim their individuality. Meanwhile, an unprecedented case of a serial killer targeting foreign female workers and their little daughters comes to the surface. With 4 of the victims being Filipino, the community, including the pageant’s participants and organizers, come together to react to the crime and pay their respects to the victims.This documentary examines gender, race, class and power relations that permeate Cypriot society, through a celebration that empowers the migrant working woman but also the horror these crimes and the institutional gaps that have allowed them.","popularity":0.2175,"poster_path":"/kfLKHL27i7NmZ1DzPmC9imqt0DD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CY","name":"Cyprus"}],"release_date":"2021-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Every Sunday","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Κάθε Κυριακή","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3179453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Keti Papadema","original_name":"Keti Papadema","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/miWOtUwokVqSw6lNfL1alM5PkCs.jpg","credit_id":"610408f18ee49c004656c3aa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3179453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Keti Papadema","original_name":"Keti Papadema","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/miWOtUwokVqSw6lNfL1alM5PkCs.jpg","credit_id":"610408fbee43e8004790f370","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3179459,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christos Kyriacoullis","original_name":"Christos Kyriacoullis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6104092b6611b4007534e7c8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3179456,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sofia Anastassiou","original_name":"Sofia Anastassiou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61040903ee43e80027bff3f7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3179453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Keti Papadema","original_name":"Keti Papadema","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/miWOtUwokVqSw6lNfL1alM5PkCs.jpg","credit_id":"6104091117c44300468a7139","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2485402,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Iara Rodriguez Vilardebó","original_name":"Iara Rodriguez Vilardebó","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6104091bee43e8007f32225a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2456008,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Israel Bañuelos","original_name":"Israel Bañuelos","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/rfSQ9iHIJ4LPRvDm4SSVVbDoBJd.jpg","credit_id":"610409344f33ad007ecf21b0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3179453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Keti Papadema","original_name":"Keti Papadema","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/miWOtUwokVqSw6lNfL1alM5PkCs.jpg","credit_id":"610408e86517d6004684bbd8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3179458,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Emiddio Vasquez","original_name":"Emiddio Vasquez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610409234f33ad00453e2482","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15857220","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zFItTMYEJDq6liTTUnAzRW2myl1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kfLKHL27i7NmZ1DzPmC9imqt0DD.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eom7329mk3Wl7GFYpangXcZKST9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":724}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Thessaloniki Documentary Festival","release_date":"2021-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
