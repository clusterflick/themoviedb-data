Stephen, a 20-something New York bachelor, breaks up with a former fling and gets more than he bargained for when it seems the one-night stand can't say goodbye. Consumed by the perception that he's being stalked by his old flame, his paranoia haunts him all the way to his wedding day, nearly ruining his marriage.","popularity":0.3086,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
