Only to find out that the most unusual manifestations of human nature can be found in photographing people in this technique. He refers to this series as “Demons”. This procedure is exclusively related to Belgrade. Unlike other cities where dark content is found in everyday life of people from margins, in Belgrade this content is found among acquaintances and friends. Boogie is able to capture something profoundly, demonically, and in the character of the “ordinary people” represented thanks to this unusual technique of the long exposure photographing procedure. Boogie describes this procedure as an alchemical one that can capture something “from the other side”.","popularity":0.1492,"poster_path":"/bhg4vU4rzkJCF24b6dZe8UMocgQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":215697,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cats and Dogs","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":215698,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mikijeva radionica","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2023-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boogie & Demons","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1538150,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maja Atanasijević","original_name":"Maja Atanasijević","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":27,"character":"","credit_id":"657617f2564ec700feb4d1eb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1122543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tinatin Dalakishvili","original_name":"Tinatin Dalakishvili","popularity":0.4273,"profile_path":"/eEo9UdPgi1rU1aygSIPKCK2dg2K.jpg","cast_id":28,"character":"","credit_id":"657617f9e93e95218eaa5e4f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4423290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mina Kitić","original_name":"Mina Kitić","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":29,"character":"","credit_id":"65761802c6006d00b0fe27e9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3954166,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Vladimir Milivojević 'Boogie'","original_name":"Vladimir Milivojević 'Boogie'","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":30,"character":"","credit_id":"6576180f4bfa5400e155613b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1051285,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darko Lungulov","original_name":"Darko Lungulov","popularity":0.065,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":31,"character":"","credit_id":"65761813a1d33200e1b7a17e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4423299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elena Nikolaevna","original_name":"Elena Nikolaevna","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":32,"character":"","credit_id":"65761828a84a472de407764f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1045521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nenad 'Džoni' Racković","original_name":"Nenad 'Džoni' Racković","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":33,"character":"","credit_id":"6576182e7a3c52012d002c19","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4423300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miloš Tomin","original_name":"Miloš Tomin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":34,"character":"","credit_id":"6576183b9451e700c7f02dd5","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4335684,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ivan Šijak","original_name":"Ivan Šijak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657617b7bbe1dd00c40c787c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4335684,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ivan Šijak","original_name":"Ivan Šijak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657617b24bfa5400fe7eccec","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4423306,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Milan Kilibarda","original_name":"Milan Kilibarda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657618ddec8a43011a398434","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27817528","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":787,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bhg4vU4rzkJCF24b6dZe8UMocgQ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":535}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
