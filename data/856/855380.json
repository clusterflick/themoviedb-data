Recreating Elder Pingree’s world from the late 1970s and early 1980s, the documentary moves from jungle village to coastal town to national capital, recounting the dramatic events, emotional highs and lows, and strict behavioral boundaries that defined his missionary experience. Elder Pingree walked hundreds of miles, visited scores of families, and eventually baptized into the Church roughly a hundred Guatemalans.","popularity":0.0902,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GT","name":"Guatemala"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Return of Elder Pingree - Memoir of a Departed Mormon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1962593,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Geoff Pingree","original_name":"Geoff Pingree","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Geoff Pingree","credit_id":"6349eb73b7abb50081e80084","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2471763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Pingree","original_name":"David Pingree","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61024711e9c0dc002c0f51bb","department":"Production","job":"Director of Operations"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1962593,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Geoff Pingree","original_name":"Geoff Pingree","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6349eb87f1759c007af04cb2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1962593,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Geoff Pingree","original_name":"Geoff Pingree","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6349eb9ee263bb007c27e671","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1962593,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Geoff Pingree","original_name":"Geoff Pingree","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6349ebb25aadc4007a7b7006","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116557,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Göran Gester","original_name":"Göran Gester","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640cacdfb4224200d8646d8b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3959167,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Micha Hilliard","original_name":"Micha Hilliard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640cacf71ac29200cd953137","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1962593,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Geoff Pingree","original_name":"Geoff Pingree","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640cacf0b4224200826d307b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3959168,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Yari Wolinsky","original_name":"Yari Wolinsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640cad0901432500821af30c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2649618,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Abend","original_name":"Lisa Abend","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640cad132a09bc00866b07ea","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3420230","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Santa Cruz, California","release_date":"2019-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
