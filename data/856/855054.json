It’s an animated biopic that starts in the early decades of the 20th century. It tells her story as a woman and artist, showing the struggle of emerging in the art world where only men could make the avant-garde.  It was created using materials from the vast Altara Archive. We created a universe of paper and cutouts inspired by the techniques she used for collages and illustrations.  The theater of narration is a large pop-up book where each page stages a chapter of Edina’s story. The memory of her past is evoked by old pictures mixed with her illustrations, a world in which symbolic representations merge in documentation of reality.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"HISTORY OF EDINA ALTARA","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
