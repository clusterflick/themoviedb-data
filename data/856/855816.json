For the time being, Inge doesn't want Hub to find out about her. Nothing should distract him from the big goal that he and her brother Wolfgang - a car mechanic like Hub - are pursuing with determination and energy: building a racing machine so that they can take part in a motocross race. Inge wants to love a hero, so she does everything she can to make the boys' dream come true.","popularity":0.0714,"poster_path":"/k5YOksCoYTa7QUmLuM6h5cSTLVj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moto-Cross","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":38990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cleo Kretschmer","original_name":"Cleo Kretschmer","popularity":0.1855,"profile_path":"/uIX2qys599pcVFH0wwcAe2EUYfJ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Inge","credit_id":"6103c3682a210c007e13a3e0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolfgang Fierek","original_name":"Wolfgang Fierek","popularity":0.2043,"profile_path":"/6cjipSR0fddxsu6iDJGtGMCAg1L.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Hub","credit_id":"6103c38b2a210c007e13a409","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558650,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Cromer","original_name":"Michael Cromer","popularity":0.0773,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67d0e7a07761a3a68f60b195","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5298573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ursula Gruber","original_name":"Ursula Gruber","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67d0e7aa7761a3a68f60b1a5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1421561,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Heitkamp","original_name":"Thomas Heitkamp","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67d0e7b07761a3a68f60b1b9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5298367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Horatius Haeberle","original_name":"Horatius Haeberle","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"67d0e7b77761a3a68f60b1bd","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5298575,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hubertus Martin","original_name":"Hubertus Martin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"67d0e7c642c0ccc3ca1e0dab","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5298577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susanne von Lieven","original_name":"Susanne von Lieven","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"67d0e7cf7761a3a68f60b1e3","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4444745,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Inge Jung","original_name":"Inge Jung","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"67d0e7d7434c98c8ec81538c","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5298581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinz Braun","original_name":"Heinz Braun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"67d0e7e6434c98c8ec81539d","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49687,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klaus Lemke","original_name":"Klaus Lemke","popularity":0.1362,"profile_path":"/qgCGAQfZAzF6CQo93MwoI3fKWeO.jpg","credit_id":"6103c3574f33ad007eced4b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1390986,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rüdiger Meichsner","original_name":"Rüdiger Meichsner","popularity":0.0864,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d0e776434c98c8ec81536e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49687,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klaus Lemke","original_name":"Klaus Lemke","popularity":0.1362,"profile_path":"/qgCGAQfZAzF6CQo93MwoI3fKWeO.jpg","credit_id":"67d0e783d4f74137326084ff","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0076414","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fgKjlbz12AApcpUtx8Rk1ZwtzkO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k5YOksCoYTa7QUmLuM6h5cSTLVj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mbBvY0iVvKhZ5ZDERSqtpcvqwyC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1977-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
