The reason why I chose a housing project as my subject is because I used to live in one and, even now, am strangely drawn to them. I also suspect that regardless of oneâ€™s nationality, the housing project is an archetypal environment universally recognizable to those of my generation. Without using spoken words, this film is a dedication to the housing project and those people of my generation all over the world.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/sONGpwR9P2E4m0O0yafg1z2M3It.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2003-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frontier","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2872123,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jun Miyazaki","original_name":"Jun Miyazaki","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/9yaY9pETcAj6Y0IXB8UFdYWyu6B.jpg","credit_id":"6101a8d64284ea0074cf619e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1279,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sONGpwR9P2E4m0O0yafg1z2M3It.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":853},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/33Rs9e36BhKOaYq48MGXsoB0vdM.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Image Forum Festival, Fukuoka","release_date":"2003-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Video Cosmology, Kobe","release_date":"2004-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
