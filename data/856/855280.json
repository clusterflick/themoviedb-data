After years in the camp he was loaded onto an airless cargo ship which was torpedoed by an American submarine. Alistair was one of the sole survivors - and drifted alone for days in the South China Sea before being picked up by a ship – a Japanese Whaling vessel. Half dead he was sent to a Japanese prisoner of war camp again. Continuing his thread of bad luck, the camp was in Nagasaki where Alistair bore witness to the devastation of the world’s second atom bomb. This one hour film is the heart-wrenching, personal testimonial of 91 year old Alistair Urquhart set against the backdrop of the little known war in the Far East.","popularity":0.0839,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":73990,"logo_path":null,"name":"What Larks!
