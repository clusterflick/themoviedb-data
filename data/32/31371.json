Fifteen years later, weakened, isolated, betrayed by many of his own, the \"Lion of Panshir\" has not surrendered to his new and implacable enemies, the Taliban. While preparing his next offensive, he evokes his commitment and his fights, and bears witness to a history in which he has been one of the main actors for twenty years. At the same time, the director questions the role and power of the media, as well as his own approach as a filmmaker. Commander Massoud was killed in an attack in September 2001.","popularity":0.4669,"poster_path":"/hgt981hu57KuJLPcHIvlRFhRpVm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13830,"logo_path":"/t0pFRwKzrnWouxema1MEBjB53ZG.png","name":"Interscoop","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":11332,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Sept-Arte","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1998-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Massoud the Afghan","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68021,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christophe de Ponfilly","original_name":"Christophe de Ponfilly","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self / Interviewer / Narrator","credit_id":"52fe44789251416c91011ccf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1164889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ahmad Shah Massoud","original_name":"Ahmad Shah Massoud","popularity":0.0853,"profile_path":"/yGrA2fVYHULDeheJm1eWTXi0g6v.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe44789251416c91011cd3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1164890,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Merabuddine","original_name":"Merabuddine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self / Interpret","credit_id":"52fe44789251416c91011cd7","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68021,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christophe de Ponfilly","original_name":"Christophe de Ponfilly","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe44789251416c91011ccb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1164891,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tatiana Andrews","original_name":"Tatiana Andrews","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe44789251416c91011cef","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1164892,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jean-François Giré","original_name":"Jean-François Giré","popularity":0.0731,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe44789251416c91011cf5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68021,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christophe de Ponfilly","original_name":"Christophe de Ponfilly","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe44789251416c91011ce3","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1160010,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thierry Garrel","original_name":"Thierry Garrel","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/1UqRMwT39qJPLkrOSdANu9R6HV8.jpg","credit_id":"52fe44789251416c91011ce9","department":"Crew","job":"Production Office Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1164890,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Merabuddine","original_name":"Merabuddine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe44789251416c91011cdd","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1164893,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anita Vallejo","original_name":"Anita Vallejo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe44789251416c91011cfb","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0194138","wikidata_id":"Q3297803","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/hgt981hu57KuJLPcHIvlRFhRpVm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1361}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3541,"name":"afghanistan"},{"id":7955,"name":"taliban"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Arte","release_date":"2000-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New York City, New York","release_date":"2002-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
