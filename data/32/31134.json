Paul and Kathy seem to hit it off rather well but, during a meteor storm, a meteorite fragment strikes Paul, burying itself deep in his skull, which has the unpleasant side-effect of causing Paul to mutate into a giant reptilian monster at night and go on murderous rampages. It turns out that this sort of thing has happened before, when Professor Salina rediscovers ancient Native American paintings detailing a similar event many centuries ago. Kathy, however, still loves Paul, and tries to save him.","popularity":2.0562,"poster_path":"/nB9N0WegYbEAEoSZKrHWv5RkuEY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100807,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lizard Productions Inc.","origin_country":""},{"id":20764,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brandon Films","origin_country":""},{"id":23967,"logo_path":null,"name":"Derio","origin_country":""},{"id":91366,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinema Shares International Distribution","origin_country":"US"},{"id":20555,"logo_path":"/hD8yEGUBlHOcfHYbujp71vD8gZp.png","name":"Taurus Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1976-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Rising Moon Creates a Monster","title":"Track of the Moon Beast","video":false,"vote_average":2.3,"vote_count":47,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":564533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chase Cordell","original_name":"Chase Cordell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"Paul G.
