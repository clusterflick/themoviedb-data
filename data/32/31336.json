Dad is an obsessive type with a short fuse and a long list of curious ideas, and his wife and children must often bear the brunt of his eccentricities. Roger works as a reporter, a job he doesn't like which doesn't pay especially well, either. One day, Roger learns an area business association is sponsoring a contest for a family that can break a world record, with the grand prize being a new car. Suddenly, Roger gets a brainstorm -- if his son can open and shut a door 40,000 times in 24 hours, the car will be theirs. 15-year-old Michel, however, is not at all happy to have been drafted into this new responsibility, especially when dad builds a practice door in the backyard and finds a trainer to teach Michel how to open and close it with greatest efficiency.","popularity":0.8776,"poster_path":"/1IjpBJXORA8ekNudBjs5j4qpgyp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22722,"logo_path":null,"name":"K-Star","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":2210,"logo_path":null,"name":"K2
