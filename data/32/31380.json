He invents the Transport, a time machine, to better the world. When he sells his invention to a defense contractor, the time machine is used by its evil CEO as a sinister weapon. Nick soon discovers that the future has been changed into a desolate wasteland controlled by gangs. Robertson has sold use of the Transport to anyone who wants to take advantage of knowing the normal course of history. The only way Nick can stop the destruction of the future is to erase his past. If somehow he can prevent his past-self from creating the Transport, the threat will be averted. In this pulse-pounding race through time that takes you from the future of 2041 to the Revolutionary War, Nick must risk everything to try and save the future!","popularity":0.6235,"poster_path":"/PDxAAvSnsjEIY128Au2Glvo5oM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26646,"logo_path":null,"name":"Edgewood Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Saving the future before time runs out…","title":"Time Chasers","video":false,"vote_average":2.6,"vote_count":41,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"Hajsza az időn át","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Tangents","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Погоня во времени","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Podróż przez gwiezdne wrota","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1337234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Bruch","original_name":"Matthew Bruch","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Nick Miller","credit_id":"53b5e7d40e0a2676c4003f9b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1337235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bonnie Pritchard","original_name":"Bonnie Pritchard","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Lisa Henson","credit_id":"53b5e7e50e0a2676c4003fa1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1337236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Harrington","original_name":"Peter Harrington","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Matthew Paul","credit_id":"53b5e7f80e0a2676cb003f07","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Woodard","original_name":"George Woodard","popularity":0.1383,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"J.K.
