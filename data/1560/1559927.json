Meanwhile,  two older sisters were adopted previously and still live in the Toronto area. Due to unfortunate circumstances, difficult situations, and past struggles with the law, Shayla’s birth parents lost custody shortly after they were born. Shayla always knew her birth parents’ full names and used Facebook to find her birth mother and followed her throughout the years.  Just a few months ago, Shayla’s adoptive mom noticed a girl on her birth mother’s page that resembled Shayla a lot.
