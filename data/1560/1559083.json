Together with his wife Irene and their sons Xaver, Ludwig, and Franz Jr., he breaks through the barriers of Bavarian folk music, blending it with jazz and influences from around the globe. Their motto: Respect – and don’t piss your pants! The film accompanies them on musical journeys around the world: to Marrakesh, the pyramids, Alexandria, the Nile, and even the skies above Iran – while Father Franz returns to his roots in the “Woid,” the deepest Bavarian Forest.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Über Unterbiberger","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
