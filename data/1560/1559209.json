What are the mechanisms for simply moving snow around? How have ski resorts mechanised what ought to be a natural process? Above all, MELT shows us the catastrophic impact of climate change. Glaciers are melting; seasonal snowfall rates are askew; and at the South Pole, an entire continent is breaking apart. What will happen if all these places succumb to rising temperatures? As one scientist states, “that water has to go somewhere.” A film of imposing beauty, MELT is also a comprehensive study of global warming as it is directly experienced by arctic and alpine communities. Geyrhalter offers a stark warning about an ominous future, one we may still be able to avoid.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":115599,"logo_path":"/oy7KfmJ1cVX4JlmheLukhHvrkox.png","name":"Nikolaus Geyrhalter
