The calm surface of the image is periodically punctured by scenes of jellyfish splattering on the ground. The association with the sound of bombs dropping is achieved with recordings of frequencies produced by a jet plane. The video conveys the unsteadiness and relativity of calmness â€“ how quickly and easily military aggression can escalate in the modern world. This work was made in response to the conflict between Georgia, Abkhazia and Russia that took place 6 years before the invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seacoast","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
