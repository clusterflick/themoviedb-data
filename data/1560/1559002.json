Work, Rest & Play has been carefully constructed using industrial and documentary film footage from 1940-1975 to follow the endless chug of the conveyer belt of life. Material from the Prelinger Archives and AV Geeks, two of the biggest ephemeral footage libraries in the world, has been pieced together in a symphony of movement and metamorphosis. Images of production lines, factories, and educational and creative industries, are sandwiched by those of the winding up and down processes of the day, the hours of leisure and relaxation, to illustrate the endless whirr of activity in our pursuit of meaning and happiness.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Work, Rest & Play","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
