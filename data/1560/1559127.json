The political topic of surveillance, a subject that has often been discussed in the shared student apartment, also becomes intertwined with Albert’s perceived threat. Under the rebellious slogan “Make Yourself Unrecognizable!”, the roommates have been developing little sabotage actions. For Albert, whose fear of control and loss of identity is already growing, the personal and political levels merge. His fear of loss of control and identity develops into a journey between mistrust, identity, and the question of whether reality and paranoia can still be distinguished from each other.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2025-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"In
