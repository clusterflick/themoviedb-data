Her maid tends to her beauty with all sorts of poisonous cosmetics, and her mother ensures that she keeps her tiny waistline by serving very spartan meals. But one day, to her great horror, she finds herself trapped in a horrific situation. A very deep male voice, which apparently only she can hear, starts to dictate the fate of the castleâ€”and predicts a grim end for the baroness.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2025-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"The Baronesse","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2814370,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Lorei","original_name":"Mark Lorei","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e64f5c89861f8c8a747445","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hofer Filmtage","release_date":"2025-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
