At once terrifying and comical.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ebXzgjU16KrJtVbzmDc9XHq5Wqf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Histrionic Response Section","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1768909,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Moore","original_name":"Andy Moore","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e661a79fdecfd1cc74752a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":"XX","iso_639_1":"xx","file_path":"/ebXzgjU16KrJtVbzmDc9XHq5Wqf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
