I was overwhelmingly sad upon both watching the old home video and seeing the VHS all alone in the rain, thinking back to all the nostalgic currency the two things hold. The work comes from a desire to be reconnected with a previous version of self;  an obsolete self. The female body contextualises technology within the realms of objectified flesh and contextualises flesh within the realms of objectified technology. Both remain indifferent to the encroaching tide and miserable weather.\" - Artist's statement","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sad @ the beach","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5739336,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lara Lindsay-Parker","original_name":"Lara Lindsay-Parker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e7379be9f6dad835b7a9e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
