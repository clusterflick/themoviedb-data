However, in its essence, it was the propaganda of the Bolsheviks. The climax of the film, which confirms the previous thesis, is the raising of a red flag over the deck of the battleship. However, recording such a frame was difficult, due to the specifics of black and white cinema. That's why Sergei Eisenstein decided to shoot a white flag. For the premiere of, he painted each frame of the film with a flag in red. In my work, I repeat this gesture, colouring each frame with the flag, but with the only difference that instead of the Bolshevik flag, I use the colours of the flags of the most influential ideologies, the struggle of which is in the modern Ukrainian society.”","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flags of Propaganda","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
