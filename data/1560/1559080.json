Born in Kenya to European parents, she grew up amid the optimism and contradictions of a fading empire. Her photography from East Africa, later published under the title Vanishing Africa, brought her fame, but her work was also controversially received, as it was shaped by a colonial perspective. Now over 90 years old, she does not wish to show her face and accompanies the film with her voice and her memories.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mirella","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
