We show how the women independently created a space of freedom for themselves, but also experience how their vision of a different life was destroyed by the closure of the house. Four former residents recall this time: Angie in her trailer, Andrea in her garden plot, Esther in her Berlin office, and the trans man Luke in Hamburg, who at the time lived in the Buntentor as a woman. We accompany them in their current everyday lives.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Freiraum","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
