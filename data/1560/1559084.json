With a raw and austere staging, and the effect of dialogues narrated in an indirect style by the voice-over of Jordi Lara, it proposes a dreamlike incursion into the universe of the poet Miquel Martí i Pol (Roda de Ter, 1929-2003).  The director and writer Jordi Lara visits Miquel Martí i Pol at the tomb in the cemetery of his town. The poet is waiting for him and together they leave the cemetery to take a mind-blowing and revealing walk, during which they rediscover the great themes of the poet's work: the factory workers, the town, illness, love and poetry itself.  Miquel Martí i Pol was a Catalan poet from the factory of Roda de Ter. He worked as a writer in a spinning factory until he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at the age of forty-four. From then on he devoted himself to poetry. He is the most popular Catalan poet of the late twentieth century.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gos que borda boira endins","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
