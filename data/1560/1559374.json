After training under James Beard award-winning chefs Cory Schreiber and Brad Root in some of the Pacific Northwest’s most acclaimed restaurants, Taylor returned to South Dakota and built a string of successful establishments. But his story goes beyond the kitchen—it’s a tale of resilience, transformation, and the pursuit of excellence in an industry known for its intensity.  Featuring interviews with renowned chefs, colleagues, and influential culinary figures, Chasing Tables offers a behind-the-scenes look at the highs and lows of Taylor’s career, capturing the heart of South Dakota’s evolving food scene.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/yshBqFrqSMwkB12QxCfn0qCMOVW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":276713,"logo_path":null,"name":"Basement Revolution
