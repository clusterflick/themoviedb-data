The 90-minute documentary follows Kaylie, Johnny and Brittany across three chapters of their lives as they grow from kids to teenagers to adults, trying to pursue their dreams while dealing with an economy where they face more obstacles than opportunities — and trying to overcome the grinding poverty that shaped their childhoods.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/78j8IZo17Q2WL5eqrAac3znDqFh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143561,"logo_path":"/fDz3pETHIkgrr6usIiUr8c7BXU1.png","name":"FRONTLINE","origin_country":"US"},{"id":78713,"logo_path":null,"name":"True
