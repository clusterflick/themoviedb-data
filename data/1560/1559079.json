The self-proclaimed last of the ‘68ers, co-founder of Commune 1, self-promoter, and contradictory outsider lives with his companions and rehearses dying. Through interviews with companions, siblings, and confidants, previously unpublished archive material, and offbeat, fictional scenes, a multi-layered portrait emerges – sometimes serious, sometimes ironic, always contradictory. How can this flamboyant media figure be captured? And what remains when the pose fades? A final look at an eccentric dreamer who always only wanted one thing: to be human.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Langhans - Ein letzter Dokumentarfilm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
