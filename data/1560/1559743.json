This means the movies intercut with each other to show the linear story of the MCU. This contains material from the Infinity Saga and ends with Endgame, so primarily Phases 1-3. It has been updated to include key scenes from the D+ shows as well as the IMAX versions of the appropriate films. This cut contains content up to Secret Invasion.  Every Marvel One Shot is included. There’s also deleted, alternate, and extended scenes from almost every movie. There’s also extra Marvel content like Team Thor and other random bonus content. There are so many great deleted scenes that feature cool character moments  but were cut for time. There are some deleted scenes that have some unfinished VFX, but it shouldn't be anything that will take you out the experience too much. I hope to put in something even the most hardcore MCU fans haven't seen.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"THE INFINITY SAGA-PHASE 1-PART 2-V4.0 (MCU Timeline Book Edit).mp4","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
