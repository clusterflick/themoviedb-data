The original idea of the project is to reflect the historical and paradoxical connection that unites continental Patagonia with the Islas Malvinas. It is a story that recreates several moments, both the arrival of Islas Malvinas settlers and the departure of Argentine pilots on combat missions during the 1982 war. The documentary is filmed in a cinematic style, but also incorporates the most rigorous documentary logic: interviews, narration, and careful historical research into the events.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/pu2GNfygWMPp9jExHk6qyRxCRt1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":276807,"logo_path":null,"name":"Laboratorio de Medios Audiovisuales de la Unidad Académica San Julián (UNPA)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1892 1982 Dos Historias de Malvinas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5740830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Gifford","original_name":"Karen Gifford","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Anne Kyle","credit_id":"68e84447eea49f59374a99f5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5740832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ezequiel Veronesse","original_name":"Ezequiel Veronesse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"William Hope","credit_id":"68e8445f2d810570fc30c0d9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5740833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erwin Anderson","original_name":"Erwin Anderson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Andrew Kyle","credit_id":"68e84475c263a4dd35b7ae5c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5740834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claris Jones","original_name":"Claris Jones","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Margaret Kyle","credit_id":"68e844d9ca4e60f8c85f6441","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5740835,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillermo Gifford","original_name":"Guillermo Gifford","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"William Kyle","credit_id":"68e844f454369a5c8eaa182e","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5740814,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pablo Walker","original_name":"Pablo Walker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e8427b6f2d216a2673dc2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5740821,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alejandro Granero","original_name":"Alejandro Granero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e84343ecf03aca98d8506d","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5740822,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"María Elena Giacobo","original_name":"María Elena Giacobo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e84365f62d4d43855f65b7","department":"Production","job":"General Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5740823,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mariana González","original_name":"Mariana González","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e8438c0421e3d70dd851e0","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5740825,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Luis Torrejón","original_name":"Luis Torrejón","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e8439f54369a5c8eaa1820","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5740814,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pablo Walker","original_name":"Pablo Walker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e843b815ce5a7ab1d85143","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1280,"iso_3166_1":"MX","iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/pu2GNfygWMPp9jExHk6qyRxCRt1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":853}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10596,"name":"argentina"},{"id":33860,"name":"falklands"},{"id":213829,"name":"argentinean cinema"},{"id":301184,"name":"islas malvinas"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"ATP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2012-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
