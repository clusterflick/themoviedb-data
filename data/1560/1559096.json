Among the ruins of their old homeland, they try to build a future for themselves. But the new capitalist game is brutal: West German investors buy up the GDR, while corrupt border guards and ruthless gangsters control all the smuggling. Andreas and Alexej are painfully stripped of their naivety and forced to realize that in this world, they never really had a chance.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Risen from Ruins","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5737602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Besel","original_name":"Harry Besel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68e64511a6e2724a99a0509d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
