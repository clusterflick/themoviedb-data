But his name was not Jesus. It was Simon, a self-proclaimed Messiah who died four years before Christ was born. Now, new analysis of a metre-tall stone tablet from the first century BC, being hailed by scholars as a “Dead Sea Scroll on stone,” speaks of an early Messiah and his resurrection. Was Simon of Peraea real? Did his life serve as the prototype of a Messiah for Jesus and his followers? And could this tablet shake up the basic premise of Christianity? Head to Israel to assess this unique and mysterious artefact, including testing by a leading archaeological geologist and comprehensive review of the letters, script and content by a Dead Sea Scroll expert. Then, from Jerusalem to Jericho, researchers investigate key archaeological ruins which could help prove Simon was indeed real – all of which just might sway the sceptics.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":28105,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hoggard Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The First Jesus?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9815272","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
