The title itself is a combination of the element moon (from the Italian “luna” ) shining over a parking slot, where a girl is waiting for encountering someone, perhaps the king of the luna park. While acting in the gap of certainties like a lonely queen the moonshine splits its aura into the colours red/blue/yellow, interpreting the interstellar communication signals of Voyager 1 launched by the NASA in 1977. Exactly the year when the protagonist Wundersaar (Luna Queen) was born. Therefore the journey of the Voyager space probe can be seen as a metaphor for the expedition of every human being discovering the unknown in the deep space of life.","popularity":0.2023,"poster_path":"/di274HDvk7Gba0eGfb34l9EzRej.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116408,"logo_path":null,"name":"Artoldo Pictures","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Queen of the Luna Parking","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2468904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wundersaar","original_name":"Wundersaar","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":"/aelEjOeATmDMIh4HiGNvSvIXCnR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Queen of the Luna Parking","credit_id":"608ebfdc25882300785e02ed","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2275064,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sara Ferro","original_name":"Sara Ferro","popularity":0.1772,"profile_path":"/oaBGP71OPeiPBkhpTnJtEThZj49.jpg","credit_id":"608ebeb20c3ec80041f967cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2275065,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Weil","original_name":"Chris Weil","popularity":0.0954,"profile_path":"/2yzp3hSDQnFEDeZmYCjyCureOAl.jpg","credit_id":"608ebec3d8cc4a006e386df4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aAX0HiDVPArUeosv6bJkiE8ZTAL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/di274HDvk7Gba0eGfb34l9EzRej.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":208733,"name":"video art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
