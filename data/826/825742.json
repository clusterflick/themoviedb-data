He's already removed 15,000 pounds of garbage single-handedly. Through decades of commercial fishing and tourism, these Atlantic harbours became trash receptacles treated with an out-of-sight, out-of-mind attitude. Driven by passion and held back by bureaucracy, this inspiring story highlights the enormity of human-caused environmental damage and the power of an individual's determination to make the world a better place.","popularity":0.1821,"poster_path":"/6dor8NOUs3J13eYXaXCyyaskrYE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":215957,"logo_path":"/vndlPfpBKOzcHIHd1csWmOhJA5L.png","name":"Catseyecinema","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hell
