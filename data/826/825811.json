Jesse is an unpredictable, mysterious woman from West Virginia. They’re complete opposites - and they’ve found themselves partnered together on a low-budget children’s theatre tour for indifferent audiences across the Upper Midwest. Unsettled by each other, and each quietly suffering from emotional wounds of their own, they’re a study in avoidance -- until the reality of their forced proximity compels them to open up. As their friendship deepens, they begin to go rogue with their shows -- rewriting them and redesigning them in order to better represent their voices, and as they do so, they find the courage to begin writing a new life for themselves.","popularity":0.2943,"poster_path":"/jnDUTzS1bHfJ27Apz2SmLMjT9WL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"All the world's a stage.
