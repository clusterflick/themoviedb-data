Seen through the eyes of his younger self, Maurice’s most vivid memory is of his friendship with Teeka, his pet goose, and the sole refuge this provides from a violent relationship with his parents. As Maurice and Teeka escape deeper into a fantasy world inspired by Tarzan comics, the goose realizes that beneath all the play lies a dark universe from which neither he nor Maurice will be able to escape.
