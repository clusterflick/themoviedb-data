The camps had about 500 facilities where there were about 60,000 prisoners of war.  Extremely difficult working conditions, no food, no shoes and clothes, winter and infectious diseases, all this affected the fact that 7,100 Serbs did not survive the camps. There is a mausoleum in Jindrihovice where the remains are victims of these camps - 7100 Serbs and 189 Russians. It is the second largest Serbian tomb in the world.","popularity":0.0507,"poster_path":"/oO4rECbFTQYxwTIgRy3L14mhqa7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seven Thousand Souls","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4105592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jelena Ciric","original_name":"Jelena Ciric","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"648472b3d2b20900ebc03e74","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1180569,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lordan Zafranović","original_name":"Lordan Zafranović","popularity":0.0785,"profile_path":"/xWMTlYJBpzmNjQlS5fyjsUqaPOG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6484730cbf31f2505706269b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4105597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Srdjan Jablanovic","original_name":"Srdjan Jablanovic","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6484733fd2b20900ad3c3e89","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2933365,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sanjin Mirić","original_name":"Sanjin Mirić","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/mlaljwCAITGw3C7Agf6narptXsq.jpg","credit_id":"608eb0e1c433ea0079e184a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12821214","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1081,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xyPISVx5RjFmgjevaTdxKtcNiJw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1921},{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/osm5I7hjcSs4zL5GgzNxOW3w5Ch.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1921},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tDXZhmqkXbEid5h6Wm0zHMTwnrU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bCb5j09Q6mXDOZhlaI9GCJ67SWM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.744,"height":2687,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oO4rECbFTQYxwTIgRy3L14mhqa7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
