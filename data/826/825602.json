When she steps out of the house to run errands, it's all by herself. When she cooks, it's just for one. Things are just a little bit quieter around the house these days. Meanwhile, the filmmaker is grieving the sudden passing of his father. As he films Marthaâ€™s day-to-day life, both come to the realization that although we may never overcome our grief, we can learn to embrace it, welcome it, and channel it to preserve the legacies of our loved ones.","popularity":0.0862,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"After Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3077475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martha Chayet","original_name":"Martha Chayet","popularity":0.0413,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"608ff3b1871b3400576fc906","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3077477,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Samuel Rosner","original_name":"Samuel Rosner","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608ff432a199a60029868a01","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4967461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeffrey Liu","original_name":"Jeffrey Liu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wPyS0u77BO8yHevE4ZkhZa8tUbU.jpg","credit_id":"66f731540eb7dc80c1c07f9e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4967461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeffrey Liu","original_name":"Jeffrey Liu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wPyS0u77BO8yHevE4ZkhZa8tUbU.jpg","credit_id":"66f73160675798e92e920a4d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4967461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeffrey Liu","original_name":"Jeffrey Liu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wPyS0u77BO8yHevE4ZkhZa8tUbU.jpg","credit_id":"66f73168675798e92e920a56","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4967461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeffrey Liu","original_name":"Jeffrey Liu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wPyS0u77BO8yHevE4ZkhZa8tUbU.jpg","credit_id":"66f73174c8af83f95cc07c39","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14488750","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"IFFBoston","release_date":"2021-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
