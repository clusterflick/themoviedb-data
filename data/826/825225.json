The film is produced by Sundance Award-winner Odessa Rae (Navalny).  Rapper Abu Hajar, together with other creative personalities of the Syrian uprising, a post-Rock musician (Anas Maghrebi), members of the first all-female Syrian rock band (Bahila Hijazi + Lynn Mayya), break-dancer (Bboy Shadow), choreographer (Medhat Aldaabal), and visual artists (Tammam Azzam, Omar Imam + Diala Brisly), use their art to rise in revolution and endure in exile in this new documentary reflecting on a battle for peace, justice and freedom of expression. It is an uplifting and humanizing look at what it means to be a refugee in today’s world and offers inspiring and hopeful vantages on a creative response to the chaos of war.","popularity":0.7209,"poster_path":"/e3i1a4yzz4hx8sgwrcXlxtJ2JYV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168683,"logo_path":null,"name":"RaeFilm
