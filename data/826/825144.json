With a sense of distance, nostalgia and care, a city washed in blue develops, its corners turning into cyanotype photographs. Preserving image to preserve memory, the film explores the complicated relationship between where you are from and how much of it you carry with you.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/mIwBkJjT2nbk1fXufsT0HZGxfr8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Imprints of Absence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3076308,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Inna Dmitrieva","original_name":"Inna Dmitrieva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608ea06a6517d60040b3e854","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mIwBkJjT2nbk1fXufsT0HZGxfr8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Alchemy Film & Arts","release_date":"2021-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
