It follows a result close to phasing, the technique developed by Steve Reich. Reich used tape recorders to repeat the same portion of sound with a time lag between the two parts, the classic cannon technique. In the canon, different voices interpret the same melodic line, but in a different way: this shift produces a superposition of melodies, that is to say, a counterpoint. Counterpoint is a discipline of musical writing whose object is the organized superposition of distinct melodic lines.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Libertine X 6","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1429329,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yves-Marie Mahé","original_name":"Yves-Marie Mahé","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60916e6768b1ea0058797528","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
