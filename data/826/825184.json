Doing doesn't provide much in the way of conventional context as to how these varied sources interrelate or how they should be read. But in editing them together at all, he asserts a radical subjectivity, an authorial presence that is autobiographical even when the images themselves are clearly borrowed from another vault. Doing positions himself, and the histories through which he has lived, within a much vaster narrative, implied through the other-realm textures of analogue footage as much as the actual content of his archival excerpts.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/lV7sMxPMn1rhxY66iPy1ANfhvg0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Vivo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338589,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karel Doing","original_name":"Karel Doing","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/9wgagOLeWNEXpjODlIPQMulXpWn.jpg","credit_id":"608eb84307e281002a8c9ee1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338589,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karel Doing","original_name":"Karel Doing","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/9wgagOLeWNEXpjODlIPQMulXpWn.jpg","credit_id":"61020bad6ee3d7005df13a92","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338589,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karel Doing","original_name":"Karel Doing","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/9wgagOLeWNEXpjODlIPQMulXpWn.jpg","credit_id":"61020bbe7d5f4b002d9e1d62","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3176914,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gareth Davis","original_name":"Gareth Davis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61020be8cee4810075e531d5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lV7sMxPMn1rhxY66iPy1ANfhvg0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Alchemy Film & Arts","release_date":"2021-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Busan International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2021-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
