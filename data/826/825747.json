Five were found in rivers surrounding Lake Superior. All were forced to leave their homes in order to attend school. Anishinaabe/Polish Canadian journalist Tanya Talaga brought international attention to this tragedy through her award-winning non-fiction book Seven Fallen Feathers: Racism, Death, and Hard Truths in a Northern City. Talaga returns to Thunder Bay and her ancestral roots to talk with the family members, Indigenous community leaders and youth whose resilience in the face of unjust colonial systems provide a path forward.","popularity":0.1694,"poster_path":"/cMb4mSHk69D76c7SoyOruwbejdE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82692,"logo_path":"/vzALKM0UwVqbzQuJOzd5kEC0nkZ.png","name":"Antica Productions","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spirit to Soar","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Mashkawi-Manidoo Bimaadiziwin","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Mashkawi-Manidoo Bimaadiziwin Spirit to Soar","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3078160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tanya Talaga","original_name":"Tanya Talaga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60907e00a06efe002aa3256b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3078170,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Zoe Gordon","original_name":"Zoe Gordon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60907eb3caab6d006facddef","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1816993,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michelle Derosier","original_name":"Michelle Derosier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60907e13fdc4fa006e924171","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1698751,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Justin Stephenson","original_name":"Justin Stephenson","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60907ebe0e597b006e686b35","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3078163,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shivani Srivastava","original_name":"Shivani Srivastava","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60907e28fdc4fa00402f1926","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1243230,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stuart Coxe","original_name":"Stuart Coxe","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60907e57931ea10041f824b3","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3078162,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nida Marji","original_name":"Nida Marji","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60907e1dae36680059a01e9a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3078160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tanya Talaga","original_name":"Tanya Talaga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60907e61629b2c00294eb8ae","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3078166,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Adam Phipps","original_name":"Adam Phipps","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60907e8a38469a002a2fe4bd","department":"Editing","job":"Editorial Services"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3078164,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rose LeMay","original_name":"Rose LeMay","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60907e32931ea10059abb786","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3078168,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sean Stiller","original_name":"Sean Stiller","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60907e9e1108a800762cd114","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3078160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tanya Talaga","original_name":"Tanya Talaga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60907e49ede1b000409a76ab","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3078165,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Eui Yong Zong","original_name":"Eui Yong Zong","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60907e6c1108a8004054caf1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15452236","wikidata_id":"Q108280903","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1536,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cMb4mSHk69D76c7SoyOruwbejdE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1024}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hot Docs (online)","release_date":"2021-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
