Neveen gives us a tour of her typical day: helping her mother with chores, attending school, learning English with her aunt. Throughout, Neveen discusses her family history and her faith; her classmates engage in a lively discussion about the history of Israeli-Palestinian relations and what they think the future holds for all people in the region.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":"/37AODPftk4n2i2JfZS6C5nWXLEC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children of Jerusalem: Neveen","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1084435,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beverly Shaffer","original_name":"Beverly Shaffer","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/deffeuxeGoM7stKUdlbmk9oQolk.jpg","credit_id":"6634188399d5c3012c56e49b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0178328","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/37AODPftk4n2i2JfZS6C5nWXLEC.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
