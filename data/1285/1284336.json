Their exchange is punctuated, as in Radclyffe Hall’s text, by the image of a panting, dying fox. Though it demands compassion, this fox is not real, and its blood looks perhaps more like lipstick. The video is scored by a hyperventilating concertina.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"“The Ideal Bar” – “Le Narcisse” – “Alec’s”","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2174709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jamie Crewe","original_name":"Jamie Crewe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6634b9fd813cb6012187a121","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
