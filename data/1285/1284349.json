Through shared points of reference and the embodiment of the above-mentioned state, the process of this work became an intergenerational dialogue with the stranger character. However, in Arrival, the narrative departs from the archived and imagines rather than a state of paralysis, the discontinuation of a cycle. Upon the character’s decision to leave her home and embark on a journey to an archipelago nearby, the island of her destination sucks her in as she merges into the wind.","popularity":0.1962,"poster_path":"/cUTs9IK8ggAkeQyh6G8qnRyhhev.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132409,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mondriaan Fund","origin_country":""},{"id":132408,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amsterdams Fonds voor de Kunst","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arrival","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2851135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flomaria Papadaki","original_name":"Φλομαρία Παπαδάκη","popularity":0.1002,"profile_path":"/i1o2ffjsGmDUbtoNWlCjp2ic8HT.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6634c07be92d830121d2a6fe","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4691495,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vasilis Kanakis","original_name":"Vasilis Kanakis","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6634c089af43240125548e33","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1980795,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kleoniki Stanich","original_name":"Kleoniki Stanich","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6634bfd0470ead012811aea7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2851135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flomaria Papadaki","original_name":"Φλομαρία Παπαδάκη","popularity":0.1002,"profile_path":"/i1o2ffjsGmDUbtoNWlCjp2ic8HT.jpg","credit_id":"6634bfead9f4a60126e30adc","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1980795,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kleoniki Stanich","original_name":"Kleoniki Stanich","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6634bffac0442901298f00c3","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4691485,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Giulia Jiménez tani","original_name":"Giulia Jiménez tani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6634c02a0f52650122bae0c1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4691489,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gunnar Gunnsteinsson","original_name":"Gunnar Gunnsteinsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6634c05ed9f4a60123e30b85","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4691492,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eleni Tsekeri","original_name":"Eleni Tsekeri","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6634c06aaf43240125548e20","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3763863,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mayıs Rukel","original_name":"Mayıs Rukel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6634c09f9590e30123bb703e","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4691499,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Inna Kochkina","original_name":"Inna Kochkina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6634c0add18572012b34bbea","department":"Art","job":"Title Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cUTs9IK8ggAkeQyh6G8qnRyhhev.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Arrival - teaser","key":"833692358","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2023-06-06T14:27:39.000Z","id":"6634bf82fe6c1801292fe238"}]}}}
