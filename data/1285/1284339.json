The environment where the short takes place offers glimpses of a labour past that can be mistaken as an otherwordly space. The artist chooses this location to set the story of an astronaut while challenging the notions of extraterrestrial migration, ecology and imperialism.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/eFLK1RefcjkHgES7ojtydmP103m.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2022-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I've always wanted to see a martian","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4691445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elena Casablanca Nyamwaya Odul","original_name":"Elena Casablanca Nyamwaya Odul","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6634bb07ad59b5012b6df2e0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3362364,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Smaragda Nitsopoulou","original_name":"Smaragda Nitsopoulou","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6634bb19c616ac012819da8e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3362364,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Smaragda Nitsopoulou","original_name":"Smaragda Nitsopoulou","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6639e6306611b4012a69a0b2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4698744,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Panagiotis Fyraridis","original_name":"Panagiotis Fyraridis","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6639e63f8de0ae0126f7ae76","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4698746,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stylianos Manolakakis","original_name":"Stylianos Manolakakis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6639e65c2a09bc01235ae9ba","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3095138,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"May Roosevelt","original_name":"May Roosevelt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6639e6666611b4012769b2af","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4698745,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vassiliki Rouvali","original_name":"Vassiliki Rouvali","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6639e64dcc277c0129249d03","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4691470,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alexandros Chatzidimos","original_name":"Alexandros Chatzidimos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6639e60854508d012ad3bbb2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eFLK1RefcjkHgES7ojtydmP103m.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":565},{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":1775,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q6eLw2C2WaJcGUGNks8nv6jsA4y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer - I've always wanted to see a martian","key":"717463733","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-06-06T10:43:28.000Z","id":"6634bb3d2a09bc012c591219"}]}}}
