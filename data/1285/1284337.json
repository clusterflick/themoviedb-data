Summoning a cast of capricious characters, Wood runs a Kübler-Ross style gamut of emotions precipitated by self-isolation, from misanthropic smugness to mind-bending ennui and cabin fever. Seen solely through the narrow lens of a smartphone camera, she dances before the flimsy trompe l’oeil facade of a Victorian parlour, existing in the space between coziness and claustrophobia, flippancy and sincerity. The film’s celebratory intimacy pays tribute to queer, radicalised or feminised practices which, being underrepresented in traditional art spaces, are relegated to the realm of domesticity and how under the circumstances in which the film was produced, have found a new appreciation and importance.","popularity":0.0789,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Powder Snowdrop Catatonic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4691439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sgàire Wood","original_name":"Sgàire Wood","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6634ba8d2a09bc012c5911f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
