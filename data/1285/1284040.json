For this special occasion, there were even two extra segments shot with Ossi Oswalda playing the lead role. In one of those films, we see how Oswalda, dressed in traditional Volendam costume, cheerfully makes contact with the local inhabitants. But not every Volendammer seems charmed by the advances of the German diva. Because of the strike, the film could only be screened one time in the presence of the three stars.","popularity":0.1156,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1920-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amsterdam Artists from the Film 'Housing Shortage' on a Trip to Volendam","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":222834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ossi Oswalda","original_name":"Ossi Oswalda","popularity":0.1777,"profile_path":"/a7S7bTG8X7eHiQZfNkeQUdYsoxC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6633e14c6611b4012466936d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":222838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marga Köhler","original_name":"Marga Köhler","popularity":0.1759,"profile_path":"/dzvdDU0kC6HpMnGwk572ceZMNUT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6633e173c616ac0125193e45","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Janson","original_name":"Victor Janson","popularity":0.1204,"profile_path":"/jmjkAwDfzOFMyDcyYYsaBl99NFS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6633e1880792e1012c79853c","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"1920-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
