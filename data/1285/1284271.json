They consult a doctor and apply parental and social pressure to modify their son. During his youth, he is pressured to marry, and derided by his fellow college students as \"special\". Eventually, he is forced to leave his home. Later in life, Tanmay and Aniket adopt a child together, naming him \"Shlok\".
