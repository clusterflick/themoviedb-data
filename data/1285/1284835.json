The picture has several outstanding incidents. The native dances are weird, but nothing compares to the shots that show the natives proudly displaying their trophies of human heads. The monkey men fascinate because they show how closely the lower forms of civilization resemble the apes. Also there are scenes taken among the pigmies, beautiful scenery, shark fishing and excellent views of a volcano in eruption.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Head Hunters of the South Seas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
