The film is a pure music and dance film and shows no less than three stellar ensembles in full action - Het Miller's hot quintet from Holland, Seymour Österwall's Swedish elite orchestra and Jimmy Woode's all-black bass are responsible for the music. Black singer Kosto Kilroy and Javanese swing singer Sanny Day are seen and heard as soloists. Furthermore, Nalen's jitterbug stars and adjutant Engvall with his 100 singers and musicians from the Salvation Army participate. A beauty pageant and a carnival also feature prominently in the film. Among the melodies is the popular samba Manana.","popularity":0.058,"poster_path":"/ifcbglBpvEk752kUEddMVRqcqnz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1948-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nalen-rapsodi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3146108,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niklas Skoglund","original_name":"Niklas Skoglund","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6634d01afe6c1801262fdb29","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4673898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seymour Österwall","original_name":"Seymour Österwall","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6634d0400792e101237a0b96","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4691574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gustaf Lindblom","original_name":"Gustaf Lindblom","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6634d047a1c59d0123e75070","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4691575,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kosto Kilroy","original_name":"Kosto Kilroy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6634d04dc3926601266e3769","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2579113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Woode","original_name":"Jimmy Woode","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6634d055c3926601236e3892","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3128570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sanny Day","original_name":"Sanny Day","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6634d05c358da7012d5549c3","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":558173,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tage Holmberg","original_name":"Tage Holmberg","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6634cfedfe6c1801232fde53","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4691565,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rickard Bergh","original_name":"Rickard Bergh","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6634cfff813cb6012987a525","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27736139","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ifcbglBpvEk752kUEddMVRqcqnz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1948-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
