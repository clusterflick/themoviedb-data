We meet Albert Engström and his family, and best friend the xylographer Karl Johan Andersson. At the beginning of the 20th century, Albert Engström (1869-1940) was a popular illustrator and became known early on for his caricatures and joke drawings. Kolingen is perhaps his most famous \"old man\" who appeared in the magazine Strix, which Engström began publishing in 1897.","popularity":0.1457,"poster_path":"/bb8IuP1GgJahTczLgRFOLaqG18Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1941-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Albert Engström and His Rospiggars","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4676454,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Albert Engström","original_name":"Albert Engström","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6634166afe6c1801292f7bf5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1316288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nils Hultgren","original_name":"Nils Hultgren","popularity":0.0959,"profile_path":"/3jKbNJNgN7rqUSCfNCSAPCfhkTH.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6634168283ee670124408637","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4690377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ludvig Nordström","original_name":"Ludvig Nordström","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6634168999d5c3012c56e42d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264165,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Adrian Bjurman","original_name":"Adrian Bjurman","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6634164dc39266012b6dc736","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264165,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Adrian Bjurman","original_name":"Adrian Bjurman","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66341647c0442901298e78bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264165,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Adrian Bjurman","original_name":"Adrian Bjurman","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66341655d9f4a6012ce29832","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21935302","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bb8IuP1GgJahTczLgRFOLaqG18Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1941-12-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
