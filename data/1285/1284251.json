The score took composer Kyle Gann twelve years to complete and became a multi-media immersion into the myths and mystery of the planets when Relâche commissioned video artist and director John Sanborn to take viewers on a journey out into space, and inside the play between reality and fantasia.  The work is in ten parts, each focused on a single planet, and blends together things we know and elements that we imagine about the heavenly bodies in the sky. We see them only through lenses, mental and physical—and we dream up more about them than we understand. We have praised them for the origins of humankind and we have blamed them for controlling our fragile lives from moment to milestone.","popularity":0.0791,"poster_path":"/5b3eVTZBV4FWpteBQoQBHJYNbFv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Planets","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1371171,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Sanborn","original_name":"John Sanborn","popularity":0.0569,"profile_path":"/1OVLASxrZi1F8FaQmIAyFjfJ7TK.jpg","credit_id":"66345f5f470ead01221170db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5b3eVTZBV4FWpteBQoQBHJYNbFv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
