The satellite got lost in the wrong orbit, forcing Maya to leave NASA in shame. In the years since, Maya came out as trans, and has been searching for the satellite ever since. When she re-discovers the satellite, Maya is haunted by the memory of her painful, closeted past. Will she bring the satellite's data back to NASA and return to her former life? Or will she let her past burn up, like the satellite's re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere?","popularity":0.2754,"poster_path":"/sLKv6aQ31BONH86QpSESMlFJ20T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Re-Entry","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4693095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danielle Squyres","original_name":"Danielle Squyres","popularity":0.2754,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6635cea9470ead01251239e4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":3231952,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tirosh Schneider","original_name":"Tirosh Schneider","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/2pi4L18uPqPQKs6RJrTktZlabBh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6635ceb1470ead0122121cbb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3717251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Dowdy","original_name":"Robert Dowdy","popularity":0.1403,"profile_path":"/wGGZzEjw6Px1VScS0qDt3QwBAg4.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6635cec0c9054f01338fc765","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1060762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Henerson","original_name":"Matthew Henerson","popularity":0.1389,"profile_path":"/hqiEirDo6LybTV8BbrXDPsjXJp4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6635ced2470ead01281240f9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1446834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jodi Carol Harrison","original_name":"Jodi Carol Harrison","popularity":0.1167,"profile_path":"/AacGBoS8seafvFhO0qX3r4MHOTg.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6635cee10f52650122bb50c4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3559679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leon A.
