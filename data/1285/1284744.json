They do absolutely everything together, speak their own language through inside jokes and code words, and share a dreamy curiosity about what their lives would be like had they grown up with a sister. When Lou’s father unexpectedly passes away, she discovers that she has a very real, and very chic, long-lost half-sister, Priya. As Lou begins to explore her relationship with Priya, her and Esther’s codependent bliss is rudely interrupted, creating a rift between them. As the rift threatens to grow beyond repair, Lou must learn to redefine what family is, or risk losing Esther for good.","popularity":2.6806,"poster_path":"/xIeUYGDSXpkqbHWsgXrIPovLKkj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sisters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2581283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna
