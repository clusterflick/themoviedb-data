Founded in 2007, the Wish Ambulance Foundation continues to work to ensure that terminal patients with limited time can say goodbye to life in a “good” way. Today, the foundation fulfills the last wishes of people of all ages with limited time to live. Frank Halter, a retired policeman who work as a volunteer for the foundation, has been part of this voluntary work for 6 years. The Good Death focuses on the last wishes of Wim Beuving, a terminally ill man with limited time left, and his meeting with Frank Halter, who volunteers to make these wishes come true.","popularity":0.0347,"poster_path":"/bcvJzTPFxyDs0y6zu9GTj8IqsaM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1626,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fono
