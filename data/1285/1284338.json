Filmed at The African Arts Centre in May 2020 during the venue’s demolition and Scotland’s lockdown from COVID-19. The novel begins with an aspiration to heal and a birth of kinship. Character growth is continued through belief in a magic. Performing as SHREK 666, the embodiment of a demonic ogre shifting through monstrous transformation chained to catholicism, he revisits a site and performance which was formerly a scene of Queer Intimacy.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where the Red Fern Grows","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4691443,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sorcha Clelland","original_name":"Sorcha Clelland","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6634baee9590e3012cbb76c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
