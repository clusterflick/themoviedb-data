But times have changed. This globalization has led to many problems within the community, and their numbers are dwindling. An Oshwal woman from Canada worries about the preservation and survival of her heritage in the hands of generations to come. She sets out on a pilgrimage to visit Oshwal communities in Kenya, where she was born; the UK, where she lived for a while; and India, where her parents originated. She discovers a shared concern for the future of the community and its traditions in the face of globalization and geographical disconnect, and explores what this means for the younger generation and their Oshwal identity.","popularity":1.8752,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":227940,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spinning Reel Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2024-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Threads That Tie Us: An Oshwal Odyssey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4691355,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bindu Shah","original_name":"Bindu Shah","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6634add266565a012c1479e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4691355,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bindu Shah","original_name":"Bindu Shah","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6634ae0ac0442901238f01b3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4691355,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bindu Shah","original_name":"Bindu Shah","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6634ae146611b4012a671628","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4867540,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"William Robotham","original_name":"William Robotham","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b02f858dc7580d703a126c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4867541,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Carlie Macfie","original_name":"Carlie Macfie","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b02f9b38d1f416635b94cf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3463760,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Schmidt","original_name":"David Schmidt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b02faa135b3e1295e24b48","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":207684,"name":"canadian history"},{"id":240847,"name":"social & cultural documentary"},{"id":257285,"name":"crowdfunded film"},{"id":322558,"name":"indiegogo"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Threads That Tie Us Trailer #2","key":"ip3jGaexG0U","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-02-27T07:00:26.000Z","id":"6634aec46611b4012d6713a7"}]}}}
