The one who is actually called Stefani Germanotta is a brilliant artist, capable of all the excesses, but also a wounded woman, marked by a terrible drama. An artist who had to fight and overcome many humiliations to reach the top. Today, Lady Gaga is an undisputed music star with 230 million records sold, and a film icon thanks to the film \"A Star is Born\" and her role in \"House of Gucci\". In less than 15 years, she has become one of the most influential women in the world. To better understand her, those who have known her since her early days reveal her secrets and tell the story behind the scenes of the films and songs that have built her legend.","popularity":0.4401,"poster_path":"/3dNZlZ7eTJIpyPwkZdezY1mlG3E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18846,"logo_path":"/mLWrerxxMimUlHfVbNZjEuBA5lc.png","name":"TF1
