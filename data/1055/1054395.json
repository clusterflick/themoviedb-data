Each word is reproduced on one frame only, appearing in the exact time/ space of the original recording (from The Fall’s 1981 EP ‘Slates’). The original track is intended to be played (loud) in the darkened cinema before the film is played (mute) on the screen directly afterwards.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/y8ZtXJnq3azkpzPf4xVQig1kl8Z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prole Art Threat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1441095,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Greg Pope","original_name":"Greg Pope","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63844a965e14e500b806d0f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13557456","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iftGdKfdXkXKnqBLGKh2bdDosB3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/y8ZtXJnq3azkpzPf4xVQig1kl8Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
