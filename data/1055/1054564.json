The film is inspired by the theater group \"Romano Teatro\" and the rehearsals and performance of their play commemorating the hate crimes, titled 'The Smile of Hate'. The documentary features the play’s creators, as well as sociologists, journalists and artists who are looking for an answer on how Hungarian society can cope with such events. The film draws attention to how art can help in processing such events, and how this might be its primary task.","popularity":0.0784,"poster_path":"/wOhlGNBtIybzP5mIlUIiNfTMU8Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132322,"logo_path":null,"name":"444.hu","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unprocessed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benedek Fliegauf","original_name":"Benedek Fliegauf","popularity":0.0711,"profile_path":"/vvp4Tj1tXHEeTfx0Q4q62IMBzRw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"63e67fa7a3d02700c82c27fa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1618704,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vágvölgyi, B.
