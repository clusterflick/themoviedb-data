For one year, filmmaker Todd Verow documented several buildings. The finished film, with a haunting soundtrack by the filmmaker, offers a non-narrative mediation on the meaningless of the word LUXURY which is used to describe basic shelter. When everything is LUXURY then nothing is LUXURY. As the gap between the haves and the have-nots becomes a black hole sized chasm there is only LUXURY or the streets, nothing in between.","popularity":0.0431,"poster_path":"/93vxFXuy6Ak2mkD5dswlfJtPg2c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Luxury","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230320,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Todd Verow","original_name":"Todd Verow","popularity":0.1566,"profile_path":"/sMpaWDiZVOkerq1V0WN9WvehvHU.jpg","credit_id":"638383b7fb83460099602ea8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7929476","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.657,"height":1522,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/93vxFXuy6Ak2mkD5dswlfJtPg2c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
