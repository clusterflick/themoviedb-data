The movement was founded by Maud Molyneux, Patrick Bertaux and Paquita Paquin as a “kind of continuation of FHAR”. The small group stands out for its aesthetic and ideological provocation, and its games on gender. Their rallying cry is “Dick!” Initially, the group was nicknamed the \"Camping Gaz Girls\". Its members showed a \"camp\" humor, proclaiming that \"makeup is a way of life\", or even \"Proletarians of all countries, caress yourself” and “Let’s nationalize the glitter factories!” Their behavior often caused scandal, for example when the Gazolines overturned a police van during a demonstration against the destruction of the Halles de Paris or during the funeral of the Maoist militant Pierre Overney. Films such as The Sperm Bank by Philippe Genet and Pierre Chabal testify to their liveliness and impertinence.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/m8N4qQ2dmj2JApmy9gZv2EnmKQ4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La banque du sperme","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3807820,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philippe Genet","original_name":"Philippe Genet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638660ad0398ab007c879886","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3807819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Chabal","original_name":"Pierre Chabal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638660965ed8e90086ac9a68","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/m8N4qQ2dmj2JApmy9gZv2EnmKQ4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
