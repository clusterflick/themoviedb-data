The characters of the film will let you into their lives for a moment, but they don't promise to reckon how their stories will end. In fact, you can be sure they left the endings for themselves. Stuffed stories are a search for the unusual in the ordinary. It is worth absorbing this uniqueness. Remember, the door will only be ajar for a moment.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/fodnpgILleQdgmEfab7sxYS1HVg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pierogi: Stories with Stuffing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3805146,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcin Wokan","original_name":"Marcin Wokan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6383be50a410c8008cd45814","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21060228","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1429,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fodnpgILleQdgmEfab7sxYS1HVg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ekran Toronto Polish Film Festival","release_date":"2022-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
