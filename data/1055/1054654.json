Not so long ago, all human cultures assumed a natural and unassailable hierarchy - Europeans on the top, blacks on the bottom and everybody else in the middle. The work of the anthropologist Melville Jean Herskovits helped upend many of these assumptions. Herskovits: A Jew at the Heart of Blackness is the journey of a man into international race politics and its consequences for him -and us- in the first half of 20th century, when the battleground in the earliest \"culture wars\" was newspapers, radio shows, movies and cartoon, all infused with propaganda that explained why Caucasians dominated the world and other peoples as part of life's natural and inevitable order.","popularity":0.2302,"poster_path":"/weW8fBmuv7bzd9d2Y9x64rSoydJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Herskovits at the Heart of Blackness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3806610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keenan Cochrane","original_name":"Keenan Cochrane","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Melville Herksovits (Young)","credit_id":"63852b81fb834600844142ec","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1786815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Heron-Duranti","original_name":"Matt Heron-Duranti","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Young Conference Attendee","credit_id":"63852b9a53866e007b097a2b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2554797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah McLean","original_name":"Sarah McLean","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Conference Attendee","credit_id":"63852bc0229ae21581171735","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3806614,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Schwaber","original_name":"Carl Schwaber","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Melville Herskovits","credit_id":"63852bdcfb83460084414300","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1263418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Steudel","original_name":"Karl Steudel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/8eouVaopwsL5OZzxvKxfWszPgXl.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Herskovits lab assistant","credit_id":"63852bf5229ae215b45f6d7e","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1247191,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Llewellyn M.
