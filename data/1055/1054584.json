But is that really just a harmless connection of sport and pleasure?  Because football clubs and breweries are often closely connected in Germany. Every club in the second and first division of the Bundesliga, without exception, is being sponsored by a brewery and also many amateur clubs are reliant on the money of the beer industry. And yet, alcohol causes great damage in Germany: 1.6 million people are addicted to alcohol, more than 14,000 die annually in direct consequence of alcohol consumption.  This film corresponds to the state as of November 16th, 2022. At that point in time, Qatar had allowed the selling of alcohol in and around world cup stadiums before and after the games. A few days before the beginning of the World Cup, an alcohol ban was announced for these areas, nonetheless.","popularity":0.2664,"poster_path":"/e0vJTCdDF1lXmPl72CwMjgPIpOV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55324,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beckground TV","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2022-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fußball und Bier: Wo Geld und Alkohol fließen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Fußball und Bier","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1746118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Freya Trampert","original_name":"Freya Trampert","popularity":0.0574,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"Narrator (Voice)","credit_id":"638505f291745b0086a96716","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3806361,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nikolaj Täuber","original_name":"Nikolaj Täuber","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63850386a410c800a433c573","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1926606,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alexander Seidenstücker","original_name":"Alexander Seidenstücker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638502d391745b00b10f85f7","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3806352,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shea Westhoff","original_name":"Shea Westhoff","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63850293bf09d1007f2580ae","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2976433,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrea Rumpler","original_name":"Andrea Rumpler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638502e0fb834600b29527c2","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3806357,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Plamen Altanov","original_name":"Plamen Altanov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6385033c91745b00b10f8615","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3806360,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marcello Ruocco","original_name":"Marcello Ruocco","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63850373229ae21572a97609","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2501276,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Martin Kaeswurm","original_name":"Martin Kaeswurm","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63850327229ae2155c53f864","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2005676,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Haesters","original_name":"Michael Haesters","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638502c3bf09d1007f2580be","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1330316,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Felix Jäkel","original_name":"Felix Jäkel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638503611b157d0085ec4220","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3806362,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Thomas Bieschke","original_name":"Thomas Bieschke","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6385039b53866e007b09738a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3806355,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul J.
