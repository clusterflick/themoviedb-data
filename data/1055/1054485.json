All the elements - the half-human half-animal figures, the strange masks, the pantomimes, the parodies and the obscenities - identify the Carnival of Skyros with the ancient Dionysia. This documentary presents the dance of the goats or \"old men\", as well as a parallel celebration organized by the fishermen of the island.","popularity":0.1114,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1971-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dance of the Goats","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"The Goat Dance","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124919,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pantelis Voulgaris","original_name":"Παντελής Βούλγαρης","popularity":0.2133,"profile_path":"/mnzYZ1iD1FTEi1cITaCWn4JS1e8.jpg","credit_id":"6384a557bf09d100afd1bf86","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3805887,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hara Koulentianou","original_name":"Hara Koulentianou","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6384a5711b157d0085ec14c9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1121069,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nikos Kavoukidis","original_name":"Νίκος Καβουκίδης","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/nSbvxRhIS5Q6AUtLLBx7SuDssKK.jpg","credit_id":"6384a582bf09d100937bf10a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":10322,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Takis Davlopoulos","original_name":"Takis Davlopoulos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6384a597fb8346007c47f5f2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"","release_date":"1971-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
