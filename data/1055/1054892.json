An African-American liquor store owner has a nervous crush on a Vietnamese manicurist. A rich Beverly Hills housewife who wants to help \"you people\" by building a womens' shelter has just had her Mercedes stolen. The Iranian dry cleaners have destroyed a dress, a group of Swedish equestrians is hopelessly lost, and Kong, the Korean landlord, is missing. With a relentless hyperkinetic visual energy and creeping sense of impending terror, UNIVERS'L captures one long day in a rundown mini-mall when the riots engulf the city.","popularity":0.6472,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"},{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"},{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Univers'l","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Todd","original_name":"Tony Todd","popularity":1.4902,"profile_path":"/6mzKpHdwfFY6sUpTS7cMPCoLzB3.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Marcus","credit_id":"638a41dd70b444008c52b3a2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3811938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Nicholas","original_name":"Anna Nicholas","popularity":0.1075,"profile_path":"/7NzO2CnByLbstxwhwTrHBEPls82.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Claire","credit_id":"638a420869eb900083c69130","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":99609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann Osmond","original_name":"Ann Osmond","popularity":0.1372,"profile_path":"/be6ZBbaWMGnSrcTCOnU4NaAH4Ac.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Annette","credit_id":"638a49883f8ede009c0b1615","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1213374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mimi Savage","original_name":"Mimi Savage","popularity":0.0764,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Yolanda","credit_id":"638a4221d2f5b500792c74df","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1026727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denise Blasor","original_name":"Denise Blasor","popularity":0.1219,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Maria","credit_id":"638a48faf3b49a007fe25ef8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brad Fisher","original_name":"Brad Fisher","popularity":0.0906,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Bob","credit_id":"638a4925f3b49a00c1bbb45a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Avner Garbi","original_name":"Avner Garbi","popularity":0.3323,"profile_path":"/e3eLtZ5ilHKaR4NaY0AkgeDpMDe.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Yehuda","credit_id":"638a4943d2f5b500792c771e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agnete Strand","original_name":"Agnete Strand","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Swedish Equestrian","credit_id":"638a496c1b722c008ed3f44a","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3811938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Nicholas","original_name":"Anna Nicholas","popularity":0.1075,"profile_path":"/7NzO2CnByLbstxwhwTrHBEPls82.jpg","credit_id":"638a10273f8ede0086e9cc80","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3811938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Nicholas","original_name":"Anna Nicholas","popularity":0.1075,"profile_path":"/7NzO2CnByLbstxwhwTrHBEPls82.jpg","credit_id":"638a102c5690b500837f2403","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25941,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dermott Downs","original_name":"Dermott Downs","popularity":0.2078,"profile_path":"/vCq8mlxsJOB4rCjanLVoaNtvJVV.jpg","credit_id":"638a49b769eb9000cab5f713","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14036,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dawn Hoggatt","original_name":"Dawn Hoggatt","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638a4a605690b500837f3be8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3812322,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Greg Ives","original_name":"Greg Ives","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638a4aee69eb900083c6942f","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0127337","wikidata_id":"Q116244783","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Mill Valley Film Festival","release_date":"1997-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
