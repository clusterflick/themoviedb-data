Perhaps a bit pretentious to say that, but such pieces as ISOLATION are something of the sort. This is a film that every time I see it I want to re-edit it, just for fun. Its like a jazz improv, and could be different during the next set – the rhythms, the pauses, perhaps with longer passages and variations in visual tonality, theme and variation, recapitulations – all sorts of musical terms might be applied. There is no real narrative development here. The film suggests that a boy in a rowboat sees glimpses of the world around him. The boy whose image you see is our son, Darmon, and long ago I was a similar boy as well.\" –Abbott Meader","popularity":0.0777,"poster_path":"/yjJF4yjmFxPGxH9O4OOcXQHO6Cf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Isolation","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2409926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abbott Meader","original_name":"Abbott Meader","popularity":0.0776,"profile_path":"/6w2FYubuteabfg5UVNDEHraRTve.jpg","credit_id":"5e4720731e92250018be959f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11024364","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lRRw7qHD35gyfeellZQLqdwY6bb.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2560},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yP5sN5pVqXRH1f6olo7wutjcLZB.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":2560},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6QHTl8kUKKO1GSYxk8qI14PERT8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rofBG8RuWNx19ipHdVzn4aPKkOe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yjJF4yjmFxPGxH9O4OOcXQHO6Cf.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fNfOM1jYtQuxK5nX3NHHttq8tv7.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Isolation (Silent, 1972-74)","key":"341355614","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2019-06-10T14:49:34.000Z","id":"5e4765172d93750015a520bd"}]}}}
