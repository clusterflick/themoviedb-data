Each person chooses an object, ordinary or unusual, which serves as a starting point for his / her story. These testimonials while helping to create a collective memory, also show the impossibility of telling a single History of this war. Only fragments of this History are recounted here, held as truth by those expressing them. In ‘Objects of War’, the aim is not to reveal a truth but rather to gather and confront many diverse versions and discourses on the subject.  ‘Objects of War’ started in 1999 assembling the testimonials of eleven persons. It was first shown in 2000 . It continued in 2003 with ‘Objects of War n°2’, recording seven additional testimonials. This time however, and since then, the recorded material is left unedited, shown in its integrity. The work of collecting and assembling these stories continued with ‘Objects of War n°3 & n°4’ in 2006 and ‘n°5 & 6’ in 2014.","popularity":0.3104,"poster_path":"/oLovrINVk4x7RipnxR6wCDeEB39.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Objects of War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2537730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zeina Arida","original_name":"Zeina Arida","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5e45dc830c27100013853920","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2537731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lina Saneh","original_name":"Lina Saneh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5e45dc8a0c271000188604ca","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2537732,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antoine Bechaalani","original_name":"Antoine Bechaalani","popularity":0.0809,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5e45dc919603310015f63d07","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2537733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samir Frangieh","original_name":"Samir Frangieh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5e45dc9adb8a0000199be8f8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2537734,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rose Kettaneh","original_name":"Rose Kettaneh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5e45dca19603310017f57afd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2537735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fatmeh Bittar","original_name":"Fatmeh Bittar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5e45dca83dd12600145c75ec","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2537737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nesrine Khodr","original_name":"Nesrine Khodr","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5e45dce80c2710001a86d413","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56834,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rabih Mroué","original_name":"Rabih Mroué","popularity":0.0499,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5e45dcf03dd12600185bba00","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1357422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asma Andraos","original_name":"Asma Andraos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5e45dcf9db8a0000129b9e85","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2537738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dina Fakhoury","original_name":"Dina Fakhoury","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5e45dd023dd12600185bba2a","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1167103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Akram Zaatari","original_name":"Akram Zaatari","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5e45dd0a0c27100013853a81","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4657056,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hervé Lemonnier","original_name":"Hervé Lemonnier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661efa9d528b2e017d3f8f30","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1756380,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lamia Joreige","original_name":"Lamia Joreige","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e45dc7b0c271000188604b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oLovrINVk4x7RipnxR6wCDeEB39.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":393,"name":"civil war"},{"id":4434,"name":"interview"},{"id":236275,"name":"lebanese civil war"},{"id":295448,"name":"lebanon"},{"id":305843,"name":"art film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
