The first part, which resembles yet is not a diary of war, oscillates between day-shots and night-shots and features a soundtrack expressing the idea of time passing, awaiting, interrogations and fears experienced in such an unusual time. The second part is a journey to south Lebanon which was devastated during that war. It alternates between peaceful landscapes and ruins and destruction accompanied only by music, as no words could express this devastation. ‘Nights and Days’ questions the relation between image and sound and reflects on notions of ‘beauty’ and ‘horror through images of urban and natural landscapes, where sometimes a detail betrays the presence of war and its violence.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/oGWzmKxlEgs2Qs6TvjTz2dQDTrc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nights and Days","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1952033,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Charbel Haber","original_name":"Charbel Haber","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e45d3909603310019f591cb","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1756380,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lamia Joreige","original_name":"Lamia Joreige","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e45d3a09603310017f56ff3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1756380,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lamia Joreige","original_name":"Lamia Joreige","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e45d36e3dd12600165c2086","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1756380,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lamia Joreige","original_name":"Lamia Joreige","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e45d3badb8a0000149b8a41","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oGWzmKxlEgs2Qs6TvjTz2dQDTrc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
