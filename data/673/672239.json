But as we approach what would have been his 100th birthday in February 2011, the totality of the legacy of America s 40th president is still eclipsed by the myth.

Using rare archival footage and personal interviews with those who knew him best, REAGAN goes beyond the myth to reveal the epic story of an unforgettable man who, against all odds, rose to the pinnacle of power.  A brand-new HISTORY special that uses rare archival footage and personal interviews to reveal the President Reagan that few of us knew.","popularity":0.4448,"poster_path":"/2zjhbRK52gxwTvrgjgpsYdf6fMV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5174,"logo_path":null,"name":"Boom Pictures Inc.","origin_country":""},{"id":3507,"logo_path":"/m7iLIC5UfC2Pp60bkjXMWLFrmp6.png","name":"History","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reagan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronald Reagan","original_name":"Ronald Reagan","popularity":0.8868,"profile_path":"/tuB7bNPABSP3MtPKpdttbz2OdSU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself (archive footage)","credit_id":"5e4446f541465c0014d19d5a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2536537,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Jeremiah","original_name":"David Jeremiah","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5e4447460c2710001883be25","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1243033,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matthew Ginsburg","original_name":"Matthew Ginsburg","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4447b23dd126001859c2c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1730987,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Palumbo","original_name":"Robert Palumbo","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4447e80102c90017575fe9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2053420","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2zjhbRK52gxwTvrgjgpsYdf6fMV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":840,"name":"usa president"},{"id":6078,"name":"politics"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
