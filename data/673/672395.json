For the pilgrims of four religions this 6675m high mountain is the ‘throne of gods’, or ‘navel of the world’ – a place where the divine takes an earthly shape. For thousands of years pilgrims have travelled to this place to worship the mystery of the mountain circumnavigating it on foot. The path around Kailash is an archaic ‘path of initiation’. Florian Fricke and filmmaker Frank Fiedler (also an original founding Popol Vuh member) made their own spiritual trek along this path and documented the journey. Accompanying epic landscape scenes in the film is the music of Florian Fricke and Popol Vuh, spiritual music inspired by this unique journey.","popularity":0.0557,"poster_path":"/9mRzlNFn5ZMkgmr5jwyVdvJNVTS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kailash: Pilgrimage to the Throne of Gods","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49501,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Florian Fricke","original_name":"Florian Fricke","popularity":0.0592,"profile_path":"/qa5a0Q28i8wnHbz9KUv2ykAuAr6.jpg","credit_id":"5e4554949603310015f59373","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2537235,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Fiedler","original_name":"Frank Fiedler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4554aa9603310015f59381","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2537235,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Fiedler","original_name":"Frank Fiedler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4554c641465c001ad3f179","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49501,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Florian Fricke","original_name":"Florian Fricke","popularity":0.0592,"profile_path":"/qa5a0Q28i8wnHbz9KUv2ykAuAr6.jpg","credit_id":"5e4557d63dd12600145bfbc0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wAU4XBv404bRaIyvuhs4YaEgdNF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.661,"height":756,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9mRzlNFn5ZMkgmr5jwyVdvJNVTS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
