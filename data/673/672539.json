This sequence repeats itself expanding at each replay and transforming its content as well as the rhythm of its images every time. The bodies in motion of the couple become abstract, blurring the border with reality.  ‘Sleep’ is the place of total separation, a unique moment of solitude to which the other has no access. In this video, sounds and images are worked to create a kind of lyricism haunted by anxiety, and to express the swing between discord and harmony that lies in the relationship to the loved other.  ‘Time and the Other’ is the story of love and separation of a couple, viewed from the subjective angle of one of the lovers. That experience is expressed in the absence of the other. It includes 3 chapters: Embrace, Sleep & Lost Chords.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/cva2q9RNjqk7V95b6OE0jW0KSAQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sleep","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2537728,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Charbel Haber","original_name":"Charbel Haber","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e45db14db8a0000179b86e0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1756380,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lamia Joreige","original_name":"Lamia Joreige","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e45db003dd126001a5beab2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cva2q9RNjqk7V95b6OE0jW0KSAQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
