The Loom features an eerie soundtrack by composer Abi Fry, produced by recording the otherworldly sounds issuing from an Aeolian harp. The Aeolian harp, an instrument played solely by the wind, was a prime symbol of the Romantic era. It was thought to have been originally invented by Athanasius Kircher (1601-1680) who was also lowered into the crater of Vesuvius, tried to construct a world language, and studied Egyptian hieroglyphics. The Aeolian harp that features in The Loom was made especially for the film by instrument maker James Parry.
