From the hope and innocence of spring training to the dog days of an August slump, the camera gets up close and personal at the home plate and records the intimate chatter on the mound, in the dugout and in the locker room. It provides a glimpse into the rewards and pressures of sports stardom and the easy camaraderie of the quintessential summer sport.","popularity":0.3494,"poster_path":"/7englCFKzamQj7Uw3xdQpdl54Db.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"King of the Hill","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590742,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donald Brittain","original_name":"Donald Brittain","popularity":0.0706,"profile_path":"/jSp8rMTzF5HI6ZvdFJ6PrkHJTCv.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Self -
