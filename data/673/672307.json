The film exposes the effects of homophobia in our schools and encourages acceptance and respect for the right of others to be and express who they are. Ongoing instances of homophobic-related violence and suicides tragically highlight the importance of reshaping the long-standing, outdated beliefs about homosexuality and those who identify as LGBT.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/c42q1Ner1zRAYB8aOH20RQn5XLy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Teach Your Children Well","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":2536835,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary Takesian","original_name":"Gary Takesian","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e44ba8f3dd12600145b3b71","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1842482","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.654,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c42q1Ner1zRAYB8aOH20RQn5XLy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":523}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
