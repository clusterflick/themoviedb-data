Text undeciphered. An attempt to explore the loss of connectedness to higher \"levels\" of consciousness, and to posit the potential for regaining that connectedness through focused attention to mundane existence. The world of nature and artifice are not necessarily separate; human consciousness is the meaning giver and hence offers a deep connectedness to all that is.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prayer Wheel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2537986,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jerry Orr","original_name":"Jerry Orr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e462c259603310015f6aa08","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
