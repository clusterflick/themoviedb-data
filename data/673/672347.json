As well as having exclusive access to Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, he followed others, including a refugee couple from Syria and a mother whose child was murdered by Golden Dawn. The result is a unique and multiple story-lined film: a tale which evolves and unfolds with the characters over time as they face difficult decisions, even to partially achieve their goals.","popularity":0.4304,"poster_path":"/8HUwHr2lrmsa07USfR1eQd4nZbW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62166,"logo_path":null,"name":"Small
