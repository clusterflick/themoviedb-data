Flint explores the critical question of how this could happen in America, and how this event should serve as a warning for the rest of the country. A recent report found that 5,300 American cities were found to be in violation of federal lead rules, and research published in USA Today detected excessive lead in nearly 2,000 public water systems across all 50 states. This documentary educates but also enrages and seeks to radically change how we view and value water.","popularity":0.0536,"poster_path":"/avEd7DoFOYiUL9Uc4eTT3l5fOiK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flint: The Poisoning of an American City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10292070","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.66,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/avEd7DoFOYiUL9Uc4eTT3l5fOiK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":660}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
