In order to stay in the game, he transforms himself into a talent scout and embarks on a mission to bring young and aspiring African players to Europe. Tempting them with big promises that seem impossible to keep, Moses soon finds himself entangled in football's infamous player trade, a system he once loathed himself. Because Moses once too was one of the thousands of African football players that come to Europe to follow in the footsteps of their heroes Sadio Mané, Yaya Touré, Drogba and many others. But only a happy few will succeed in building a professional career on a European football pitch. For every successful African football player, thousands remain in the shadows, not making it professionally, and not able to return to Africa, out of shame and fear of disappointing their families back home.","popularity":0.1614,"poster_path":"/4MW6yo7rjfc4UwWihsbXJRkYC86.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sideline","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joost Wynant","original_name":"Joost Wynant","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e453d589603310017f4f0f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1366174,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maarten Goffin","original_name":"Maarten Goffin","popularity":0.0916,"profile_path":"/wXrjkgnP6QGHmcNVUG2wk7MGpTE.jpg","credit_id":"5e453d7d3dd12600165b73a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2537176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Pons","original_name":"Louis Pons","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e453d9d3dd12600185b2228","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joost Wynant","original_name":"Joost Wynant","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e453db141465c001ad3db55","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2537176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Pons","original_name":"Louis Pons","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e453dbfdb8a0000129af06a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1366174,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maarten Goffin","original_name":"Maarten Goffin","popularity":0.0916,"profile_path":"/wXrjkgnP6QGHmcNVUG2wk7MGpTE.jpg","credit_id":"5e453dca41465c001ad3db8b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2174976,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Gert Van Berckelaer","original_name":"Gert Van Berckelaer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e453ded3dd12600165b7424","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2174976,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Gert Van Berckelaer","original_name":"Gert Van Berckelaer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e453dfb3dd12600185b2262","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2537177,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alexander De Backer","original_name":"Alexander De Backer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e453e113dd12600145bda38","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8903462","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4MW6yo7rjfc4UwWihsbXJRkYC86.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Filmfestival Oostende","release_date":"2018-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
