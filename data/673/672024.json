It took him 20 years to return - only this time as an observant woman. The documentary by Rachel Rusinek and Eyal Ben Moshe touches honestly and openly on a subject that is both relevant and unspoken. It is also a film about self-acceptance, compassion, love, and family.","popularity":0.0427,"poster_path":"/lT0UO8x11KfgtjxYfuo1rQUQ8WM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129053,"logo_path":"/7Qtj1FmPeXbc4ZHTkl7eB0itG3p.png","name":"Yes Docu","origin_country":"IL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2019-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Was Not Born a Mistake","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5042083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yiscah Smith","original_name":"Yiscah Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6729f25e599da28980952378","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2535907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eyal Ben Moshe","original_name":"Eyal Ben Moshe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e434f729603310017f21110","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2276432,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Rachel Rusinek","original_name":"Rachel Rusinek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e434f819603310017f2116a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2276432,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Rachel Rusinek","original_name":"Rachel Rusinek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6729f1eb425bdcd2ace32944","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11534360","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/obaaHbuZXyr6zK14zBF4Fh0CsYq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.74,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lT0UO8x11KfgtjxYfuo1rQUQ8WM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":740}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
