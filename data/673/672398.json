They shuffle through subterranean car parks, sprawling shopping centers and soaring office towers, leaving behind a trail of gleaming floors and emptied waste paper baskets. They are the cleaners – an invisible and underpaid army whose necessary work goes unnoticed.In Lessons From The Night we spend a night with Maia, who reflects on life, work and toilet bowls as we follow her nightly cleaning round through silent empty spaces. As she works, she reveals some of the secrets of the city – the traces of human presence that we leave behind each day – and of her former life in Bulgaria. Lessons From The Night is both a homage to the menial worker and an existential film about cleaning.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":129058,"logo_path":null,"name":"Feather Films","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2009-01-08","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lessons from the Night","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1444283,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marcus Dineen","original_name":"Marcus Dineen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e45575b41465c0018d39cf3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2537242,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrian Francis","original_name":"Adrian Francis","popularity":0.0645,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4556b9db8a0000199b2afc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2537244,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gai Dunlop","original_name":"Gai Dunlop","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4557420c2710001384b044","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2537242,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrian Francis","original_name":"Adrian Francis","popularity":0.0645,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e45578f0c2710001885564e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2433469,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Melanie Brunt","original_name":"Melanie Brunt","popularity":0.1009,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4556f641465c001ad3f51a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2537242,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrian Francis","original_name":"Adrian Francis","popularity":0.0645,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4556ad9603310015f5968b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1341741","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Flickerfest International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2009-01-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Sundance Film Festival","release_date":"2009-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
