Using transducers made from window screens and nylon cord, and amplifying the tall grass and weeds, I shot several cartridges of Super 8 in very windy weather. The last one was shot in a gentle rain and the rainfall 'plucked' the windharps as it fell, while I filmed a fisherman preparing his boat. The middle section of this film was shot in a small fishing village Port Kerwin , about 60 miles south of St. John's, at the studio of artist Don Wright. Here, I amplified pine trees, set up windharps and recorded the gulls overlooking a bay beneath me. This film is dedicated to the memory of Don Wright, his courage and his work as an artist.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"St. Johns Harbor & Port Kerwin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2539026,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Lerman","original_name":"Richard Lerman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4762b3676ce20018fcc4e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
