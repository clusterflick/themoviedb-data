But like he has every previous time after their sexual encounters, in-the-closet Sam is going home to his parent's house where he still lives, rather than stay the night at Eric's. If Eric and Sam truly see each other as a boyfriend, Sam will soon have to make that symbolic leap of spending the night or else risk losing Eric.","popularity":0.0917,"poster_path":"/kns1p4si8ETEki6iRrAfZdLZI9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"What does one night mean to you?","title":"Stay","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2482670,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aaron Chan","original_name":"Aaron Chan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec34f263d3557001ee9ae0f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1726766","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":850,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kns1p4si8ETEki6iRrAfZdLZI9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":638}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
