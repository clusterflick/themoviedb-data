The question gravitates: What does the future hold for them? Since the closure of its uranium mines, the small town of Mounana has been forgotten. Today, the former miners, having worked all their lives for the French nuclear industry, fear for their health and that of their families and must deal with the daily life in a region that is said to be polluted. In the depths of the Gabonese forest, between the memory of a prosperous past and the reality of a painful present, they must redouble their efforts to build a future and live with dignity.","popularity":0.0656,"poster_path":"/5dKhKSEIR7pr1eTr1naM0H8gXA7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Invisible Wounds","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3882055,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Michel","original_name":"Eric Michel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ca06bb68afd600a496733f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5dKhKSEIR7pr1eTr1naM0H8gXA7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
