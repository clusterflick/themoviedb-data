He worked hard from dawn to dusk, so that his seven children would have a roof above their heads. Unfortunately, the task ended up being too hard and Markku burnt out. One day, he left his family and disappeared abroad.  The filmmaker travels to his childhood home to face his father, who he never got to know properly. Together they build a steel gate in front of the unfinished house, and try to create a relationship between each other.","popularity":0.3083,"poster_path":"/J7QxuTpVEqbQUiGHgMP7uA6Gd9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":191375,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jok√≠
