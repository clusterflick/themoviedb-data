Legend recalls that the remains of the Christian apostle St. James the Great were mysteriously discovered at Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Spain after having thought to be lost. For centuries, pilgrims have traveled the route, also known as the Way of St. James, for spiritual reasons. This film, The Camino Within, follows pilgrims along this Way. Sharing their stories and profound experiences about how walking the Camino changed them in different ways, viewers will be inspired to experience this pilgrimage as their own interior journey of discovery.  Added Value (30 minutes) Bishop Donald Hying, the Catholic Bishop of Madison, Wisconsin, and Fr. Jordan Berhouse (assistant director) host discussion with an audience on the campus of Ave Maria University.","popularity":0.1586,"poster_path":"/5wOWZvzfRVcNKCeGnR4axsZRkJo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Santiago: The Camino Within","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5388919,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erin Berghouse","original_name":"Erin Berghouse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6807e5a6ac02d4407bab147c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26350075","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5xBtv5d1JJ1jKutbUZVXmcIxPBK.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bfLGTMOBbo3x9mHZ4HOyqNz8yuG.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5wOWZvzfRVcNKCeGnR4axsZRkJo.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bCcDKuZ4O6gWGHJW8xmypLDD7sj.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":550},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1717,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/g7hYKdD8yYROQIOuExvkSwrbTs8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1145}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Fathom Events Limited Release","release_date":"2023-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"SANTIAGO   THE CAMINO WITHIN Trailer","key":"t8TrMehHKDg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-05-01T02:43:17.000Z","id":"63e29f207776f0009a7e5fc1"}]}}}
