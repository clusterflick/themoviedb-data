Ceremonies are a way, sometimes agreed upon and sometimes not, of dealing with life situations. They seldom are a way of resolving those situations. Fantasies are our fears and wishes arguing with and sometimes defeating aspects of reality; they may afford insights but never a reality-based solution. -Hugh Thompson","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ceremony","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3880699,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugh Thompson","original_name":"Hugh Thompson","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c8d44bc5c1ef008ae4f5ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
