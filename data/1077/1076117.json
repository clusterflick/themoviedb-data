Kenyatta entered politics in the mid-1920s and then spent 17 years in exile in Europe. He returned to Kenya in 1946, and was elected president of the nationalist movement, the Kenya African Union. Arrested and imprisoned in 1952 for allegedly leading 'Mau Mau', he was released in 1961 and two years later became Kenya's first Prime Minister. In power, the man whom European settlers had once reviled as \"the leader to darkness and death\" was eulogized by them as a pillar of stability, while former allies challenged him by creating a left-leaning political opposition. Kenyatta weaves archival and contemporary images with interviews with friends and relatives, comrades and opponents, to create a biographical portrait of a key figure in 20th century politics, and a case study of what Frantz Fanon called the pitfalls of nationalism as a political force in Africa.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/ehhqHcqPdQu2rCfLLlSZBh5qjIN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kenyatta","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Black Man's Land: Images of Colonialism and Independence in Kenya; Kenyatta","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2742417,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Musindo Mwinyipembe","original_name":"Musindo Mwinyipembe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"63db99b9a6c104007f6422f4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1316121,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Koff","original_name":"David Koff","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c8ce4c70b44400c8befe2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1316124,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anthony Howarth","original_name":"Anthony Howarth","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c8ce5f70b444007dd843f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1316121,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Koff","original_name":"David Koff","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63db89e0955c65007bac5c2d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1316121,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Koff","original_name":"David Koff","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63db89e7a6c1040085882545","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1316124,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anthony Howarth","original_name":"Anthony Howarth","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63db89f2a9117f7082131dd4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3902474,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mohinder Dhillon","original_name":"Mohinder Dhillon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63db89faa9117f7052296a5c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1554990,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bruce Parsons","original_name":"Bruce Parsons","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63db8a03955c65008c7cacb4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3352683,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Roger Buck","original_name":"Roger Buck","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63db8a0b85702e058eece3fe","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11385,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ivan Sharrock","original_name":"Ivan Sharrock","popularity":0.1196,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63db8a11a5743d007b529eed","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3281776","wikidata_id":"Q56300352","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ehhqHcqPdQu2rCfLLlSZBh5qjIN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
