The 29-year-old was terminated after she resisted her former boss's advances. Since then, she has been trying to control her impulsive temper and her anger, which comes up quickly. She wants to forget what happened and reorganize her life. Even when she moves in, neighbor and property manager Manfred is very accommodating and lends her tools. But his pushy friendliness seems all too familiar to Caro. The early retiree has a weakness for pretty young women and is known as a patterer. Caro has taken a direct liking to him and he is convinced that her reserve conceals great affection for him. When Caro comes home one day, an uninvited gift from her new neighbor is lurking behind her apartment door. Following her angry impulse, Caro confronts Manfred the same evening.","popularity":0.0218,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rigor Samsa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2627504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthias Kress","original_name":"Matthias Kress","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/cqLbS3Ax0ymd7VE8xOAPOT7ze4V.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Manfred Schuster","credit_id":"63df7423cd204600c30afaf0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3906767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lara Ziffer","original_name":"Lara Ziffer","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Caro","credit_id":"63df7438cd20460085b345c9","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3883025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ann-Kristin Faber","original_name":"Ann-Kristin Faber","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63df73fb8741c4007db07829","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
