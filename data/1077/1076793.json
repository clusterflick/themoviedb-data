Hunter's Songs of the Border","overview":"Against the backdrop of President Trump's much-trumpeted wall, Reginald D. Hunter takes a 2,000-mile road trip along the US-Mexico border to explore how romance and reality play out musically where third-world Mexico meets first-world USA on this broken road to the American dream. Classic American pop and country portray Mexico as a land of escape and romance, but also of danger; Hunter explores the border music as it is today, much of it created by musicians drawn from the 36 million Mexican-Americans who are US citizens.","popularity":0.3007,"poster_path":"/emahZTgynpvUDoHMaqf56uoKqje.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80893,"logo_path":"/hFzOkuR4FoZE1U1hvuojMp4Qfxa.png","name":"BBC Studios","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reginald D.
