Andreas Velissaropoulos asks.... He describes his film as ‘a surrealist “poorman's superproduction,” full of cultural and historical allusions, contrasting with short glimpses of contemporary reality concerning life and mentalities of young inhabitants of modern Athens.' The sound track uses the music of Beethoven, Bach, Berg, Schoenberg, Richard Strauss and Wagner. Balinese monkey chants, pop culture, symbols of fates, seasons and the elements are interwoven.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Opera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2209667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andreas Velissaropoulos","original_name":"Andreas Velissaropoulos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c9f2d7ed96bc0091aa471d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1169249","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
