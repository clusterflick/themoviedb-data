Resurrection is undoubtedly the most popular of all Mahler's symphonies.","popularity":0.1378,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":52114,"logo_path":"/fQkQoS3C8Vpya8tolBXFTL5ZpMW.png","name":"Camera Lucida","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":72142,"logo_path":null,"name":"Festival d'Aix-en-Provence","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Résurrection","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1525728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Romeo Castellucci","original_name":"Romeo Castellucci","popularity":0.0519,"profile_path":"/1EDH1YiA5FS1JkPuD63s7qUOom5.jpg","credit_id":"640c6281e18e3f0816c28479","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124437,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philippe Béziat","original_name":"Philippe Béziat","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640c62572a09bc00a2ac14c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1424083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esa-Pekka Salonen","original_name":"Esa-Pekka Salonen","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/eVA3KfJXGuM46MVAM0ckmgbyssr.jpg","credit_id":"640c6293a6c10400f7609bd4","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1525728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Romeo Castellucci","original_name":"Romeo Castellucci","popularity":0.0519,"profile_path":"/1EDH1YiA5FS1JkPuD63s7qUOom5.jpg","credit_id":"6743ae98dae2e6a93825cb50","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
