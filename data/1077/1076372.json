Her work is dedicated to environmental science and the essential role of Indigenous communities in these spaces. Her hope is to create more inclusive academic and environmental landscapes.  In place of her graduation, which was canceled as a result of the pandemic, Lydia instead celebrated by running 50 miles in honor of the Indigenous scientists and knowledge keepers who came before her. Itâ€™s a run to honor the past and present while looking towards the future.","popularity":0.6708,"poster_path":"/5rVcfbEGDGuYUpavcWYUka0lpGQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Run to Be Visible","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3881740,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lydia Jennings","original_name":"Lydia Jennings","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"63c9b6fa68afd60086f98d26","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1760375,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Devin Whetstone","original_name":"Devin Whetstone","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c9b5b768afd6008ef5b374","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1965391,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Monika McClure","original_name":"Monika McClure","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c9b6c00398ab008e230aa2","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3881738,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jordan Marie Daniel","original_name":"Jordan Marie Daniel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c9b5d00398ab00cc1afa46","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3881740,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lydia Jennings","original_name":"Lydia Jennings","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c9b69268afd600acf57736","department":"Writing","job":"Story Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3881739,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jack Schlinkert","original_name":"Jack Schlinkert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c9b66a68afd600acf57722","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2294957,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dana Shaw","original_name":"Dana Shaw","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c9b67f68afd6008ef5b398","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3881741,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bianca Botta","original_name":"Bianca Botta","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c9b6d40398ab00863215b1","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1408909,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alex Lowther","original_name":"Alex Lowther","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c9b6a803f0b600872c1c93","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":968,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5rVcfbEGDGuYUpavcWYUka0lpGQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":645}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":156388,"name":"environmentalism"},{"id":211143,"name":"conservation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
