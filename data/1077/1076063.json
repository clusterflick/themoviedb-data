In the Soviet era, an underground gay resort arose in the village. It started with a small nudist beach; a popular bar and night club, Hedgehogs, appeared later in independent Ukraine. From the 1990s on, Simeiz became a significant meeting point for members of the LGBTQ+ community from Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. Every year, about 4,000 people visited the place before the temporary occupation of Crimea by Russia in 2014. At the moment, Simeiz, as a gay resort, is threatened with disappearance due to the homophobic laws of the Russian Federation. If this happens, old photos and videos will be the only evidence of its existence and extinction.  The project was first an exhibition, then an installation, then a two-channel video, and only then turned into a short film.","popularity":0.6672,"poster_path":"/bk6km1X3SSb7potO6WS2TU2ND09.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2022-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Simeiz","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3880522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anton Shebetko","original_name":"Anton Shebetko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/mSr0cZJ9INLix2d1xJE1prVNnIy.jpg","credit_id":"63c89fb0142ef1008209c40a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3880522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anton Shebetko","original_name":"Anton Shebetko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/mSr0cZJ9INLix2d1xJE1prVNnIy.jpg","credit_id":"63d29d34e72fe800aa0240fb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3880522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anton Shebetko","original_name":"Anton Shebetko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/mSr0cZJ9INLix2d1xJE1prVNnIy.jpg","credit_id":"63d29d3fa410c812385d3db9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3880522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anton Shebetko","original_name":"Anton Shebetko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/mSr0cZJ9INLix2d1xJE1prVNnIy.jpg","credit_id":"63d29d4d5a07f50082f38955","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26456190","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bk6km1X3SSb7potO6WS2TU2ND09.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":274118,"name":"nudist beach"},{"id":308591,"name":"soviet"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Image+Nation Festival Film LGBTQueer Montreal","release_date":"2022-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"uk","note":"Sunny Bunny LGBTQIA+ Film Festival","release_date":"2023-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
