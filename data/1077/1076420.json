A colorful, animated paper collage, the video is assembled from scraps of 1950s and '60s children's books, how-to manuals, science texts and encyclopedias. A \"biography\" using science fiction elements to explore the classic themes (otherness, paranoia, alternate reality) of the genre. The video is a life story constructed from pieces of other stories, much the way we base our ideas of self on pieces of information we receive from our environment.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sensing the World by Echo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3048968,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Taylor","original_name":"Mark Taylor","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c9dd50bb070d0081837c22","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Specific release date not listed","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
