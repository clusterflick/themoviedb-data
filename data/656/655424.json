The Snail and the Whale is the much loved classic that shows us a restless young snail who has ambitions to travel the world. The other snails think she should stay put, but she puts out a call for a “Lift wanted around the world”. Eventually her call is answered by a great big grey-blue humpback whale! She sets off with him across the seas. On their journey the snail and the whale discover towering icebergs and far-off lands, fiery mountains and golden sands. The snail is delighted by the wonderful world around her, until she realises how small it makes her feel.","popularity":2.0732,"poster_path":"/qWsqdJ6XUvwimqxwlplIazKjpve.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5644,"logo_path":"/uuj37wq2xE3Vru17BOs86ScNRc5.png","name":"Magic Light
