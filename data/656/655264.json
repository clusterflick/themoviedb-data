While the hardworking people long for peace and happiness, Lo writes hymns in honor of the militant emperor, who is perpetually hungry for conquest. The monarch is pleased by the poet’s words, but the people do not want to hear the hymns praising him anymore. Lo is completely unaware of this and is surprised when the kitchen maid Hsi-Hua refuses to sing his hymns. With her help, Lo learns what the people really want and is able to see how cruel the emperor is.","popularity":0.111,"poster_path":"/2AOTTLOfZFyosGcMty2QluKzo0u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55763,"logo_path":null,"name":"DEFA-Studio für Trickfilme","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1963-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zwei Lieder","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1832706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siegfried Göhler","original_name":"Siegfried Göhler","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"5df204122cde9800122f2272","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1709952,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katja Kuhl","original_name":"Katja Kuhl","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"5df2041fa284eb001759f302","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1997152,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gerti Gruner","original_name":"Gerti Gruner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df203d6a284eb001759f2b2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2480825,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Heinz Vogt","original_name":"Heinz Vogt","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df203ff18b751001241abd6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1469713,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Werner Krauße","original_name":"Werner Krauße","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df2039918b751001742035b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2404706,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johannes Hempel","original_name":"Johannes Hempel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df203bb18b751001241ab11","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2010216,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Wolfgang Schiebel","original_name":"Wolfgang Schiebel","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b10abfaf9b0caae135c5a8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1316495","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.749,"height":934,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2AOTTLOfZFyosGcMty2QluKzo0u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1963-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
