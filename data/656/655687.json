She is extremely reticent and her silence and habit of looking at people's eyes straightly sometimes cause misunderstanding. The reason behind it is not because she doesn’t like to talk nor because she has nothing to say. The reason she rarely speaks is due to the fact she thinks too much before speaking, thus losing the timing to speak altogether. But she lives a happy school life with her classmates.","popularity":1.0834,"poster_path":"/r9nL2dK8tmTSL5sgeVFMvBGtekD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92966,"logo_path":"/9zBMa5LyxHKyatDLHJGal7jetHR.png","name":"Seven","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2011-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miss Morita is Taciturn","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Morita-san wa Mukuchi","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"森田さんは無口","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Miss Morita is Taciturn","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":119143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kana Hanazawa","original_name":"花澤香菜","popularity":2.037,"profile_path":"/rYbVloKRRK3gRTVAf3Mbj9xak4Z.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mayu Morita (voice)","credit_id":"5df4d9c99450fe00112425ff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":934634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoshino Nanjo","original_name":"南條愛乃","popularity":1.3453,"profile_path":"/tkeAJsWuJMFdIYU0LrwHEPxBx77.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hana Matsuzaka (voice)","credit_id":"5ff2d015fbe36f0041f7d6da","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1248340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Haruka Tomatsu","original_name":"戸松遥","popularity":1.1772,"profile_path":"/geVvuA2zMGE5xzfc20aDelJSelu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Miki Murakoshi (voice)","credit_id":"5ff2d050df294500412e0665","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":221773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saori Hayami","original_name":"早見沙織","popularity":1.959,"profile_path":"/gLv9lO7dlUbIsmyJUvgegqAAXki.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Chihiro Miura (voice)","credit_id":"5ff2d096fab3fa003c769020","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1884977,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yu Sato","original_name":"佐藤裕","popularity":0.1391,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6241dac597a4e60087613608","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2538310,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Keiichi Nozaki","original_name":"野崎圭一","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff2d1ea46e75f0040d4735f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2922690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Naotaka Hayashi","original_name":"林直孝","popularity":0.2317,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff2d11ddf2945003f2d1cac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.73,"height":2220,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r9nL2dK8tmTSL5sgeVFMvBGtekD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1620}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9914,"name":"slice of life"},{"id":10873,"name":"school"},{"id":13141,"name":"based on manga"},{"id":210024,"name":"anime"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"6","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2011-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
