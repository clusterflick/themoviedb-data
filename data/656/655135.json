The film is structured in three blocks subdivided into corners: - the first \"discovers\" the theme of the earth and its characters, focusing on the proper land problem; - the second analyzes land use by studying the agricultural economy; - and finally, the third presents the violence generated by the concentration studied in the first two. First documentary consisting of a large panel of landscape and Brazilian history, filmed throughout our territory and focusing on the land problem - with serious consequences for the current stage of Brazilian development from the discovery to the present day. Set up for greater ease of use, filling a serious gap with schools, unions and universities.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"O Canto da Terra","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1785296,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paulo Rufino","original_name":"Paulo Rufino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Director","credit_id":"5df123ac8d77c40015d866d9","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
