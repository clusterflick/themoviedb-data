Layered and luminous with in-sight.  An account of a journey from home to work as seen through the filter of the conscious and subconscious mind.  Through the use of moving collages and painterly animation laid over Hi-8 footage, the viewer is able to share the traveller’s experiences and his mental reactions to the trials and triviality of urban existence.  An animated account of a two mile journey made from home to work on foot. Hi-8 video footage digitized and printed out using an inkjet printer is combined with drawings, text and paint. A subjective representation of how visual information is filtered and processed by the conscious and subconscious mind. We share the traveller’s experiences: his idle thoughts and repetitive neuroses and see his mental reactions to the trials and triviality of daily life.","popularity":0.0747,"poster_path":"/jk5svYTcwCDBRSEHGyoP40tTVGC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119452,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hodgson Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Feeling My Way","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211788,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jonathan Hodgson","original_name":"Jonathan Hodgson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df38607fac502001383d425","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2006112","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jk5svYTcwCDBRSEHGyoP40tTVGC.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z3i3GmNLESMO78f5rzUIACZDvTR.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":798}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
