Once he’s had breakfast and gotten dressed, Wiktor is ready for an intense day at ballet school, where he and his classmates are rehearsing for an important performance. All the proud parents will be sitting in the front row, and while Wiktor’s kind grandmother will of course come, the young dancer is desperately hoping that his father, who lives abroad, will be there, too. Wiktor wants nothing more than to make his father proud.","popularity":0.0869,"poster_path":"/9u4vvdI8AFHZvGht7vCu9aArg2G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139784,"logo_path":null,"name":"Media Move","origin_country":""},{"id":45475,"logo_path":"/1V0CgkIcyMTfOWeke2dVM4O5hYI.png","name":"Studio Munka","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":78877,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stowarzyszenie Filmowców Polskich","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2018-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dancing for You","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2481075,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kazimierz Ciesla","original_name":"Kazimierz Ciesla","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5df2623e8d77c40018dab37b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2481076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teresa Perdek","original_name":"Teresa Perdek","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5df2624b8d77c40018dab3a3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2481077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wiktor Perdek","original_name":"Wiktor Perdek","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5df26255839d9300114982ad","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2481078,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dawid Rother","original_name":"Dawid Rother","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5df2625e2cde9800142fc2ba","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3428582,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dominika Połomska","original_name":"Dominika Połomska","popularity":0.0522,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66073c7b5900860149b64936","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2070714,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katarzyna Lesisz","original_name":"Katarzyna Lesisz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df262922cde9800142fc372","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2070714,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katarzyna Lesisz","original_name":"Katarzyna Lesisz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df2629b18b751001442711b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10654844","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9u4vvdI8AFHZvGht7vCu9aArg2G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":702}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
