Only to discover a little later that actually nothing was found.  Much was written about Atlantis. It is said Atlantis was a magnificent island in the Atlantic Ocean. Sometimes — depending on the fantasy of the writer — it is moved to the Mediterranean Sea. Sometimes people look for it in the Indian Ocean, or on the South Pole — any exotic location will do. In great depths of the ocean it has disappeared forever. But what people forget conveniently: we only have one reliable source to Atlantis. This is Plato, the great Greek Philosopher.  Two explorers George S. Alexander and Natalis Rosen follow closely in this documentary the ancient writings of Plato. That is how they found the Lost City of Atlantis. One by one they solve Plato’s riddles, uncovering the evidence which links Atlantis to a desolate area, virtually untouched by modern man.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/30Uno9xyChFnSKYYsViTCVnQ41A.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"2011","title":"Visiting Atlantis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"Visiting-Atlantis-212385738785943","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/30Uno9xyChFnSKYYsViTCVnQ41A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
