He is survived by his Caucasian wife, Grace Beardsley, a post-doctorate in medicine. At Jon's traditional native memorial service held at Bannock Point on the shores of Lake Winnipeg, Grace is reacquainted with Jon's best childhood friend, Brandon Eckhardt. With Jon having foreseen his own imminent death, Grace learns that Jon has left her a series of pre-recorded video messages which are triggered by GPS coordinates linked to Grace's cell phone.","popularity":0.5755,"poster_path":"/1sXzfx5Rryo1pOBJsEmy2gqH9xl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":137,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Path of Souls","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Beach","original_name":"Adam Beach","popularity":1.0733,"profile_path":"/3ZMGfnRc7dYnAPl6ZSbGhqj6LHx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jon Beardsley","credit_id":"66cb2ff4b5973d9fa8187ea8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":25872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Harris","original_name":"Laura Harris","popularity":0.6712,"profile_path":"/f6Rsq2C9k87loUH6ZuM0zWGuIQo.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Grace Beardsley","credit_id":"66cb30070649da18d83ec3ee","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corey Sevier","original_name":"Corey Sevier","popularity":0.7424,"profile_path":"/wKt1pHZ5Q6kgkmZsNz53lNPzLR3.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Brandon Eckhardt","credit_id":"66cb3022b04b443e84205581","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668936,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeremy Torrie","original_name":"Jeremy Torrie","popularity":0.0959,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cb30ce94e59c8441d3ecd4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2070773","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xctR7l3a0wWmu1rs42dPuc9RBHQ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1707}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":825,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1sXzfx5Rryo1pOBJsEmy2gqH9xl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
