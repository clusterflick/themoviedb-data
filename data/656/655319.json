The trip is enclosed in three conditional spaces: abandoned in an empty field - a hostel for internally displaced persons who exist outside the present and future, with a scattered, burned past. Cold twilight Moscow with a Chechen guy wandering along its streets, vocalist of the Dead Dolphins band, Arthur, who recalls his once beloved city, but does not want to return and see the place where his house used to be. Exhausted, abandoned by the souls that once inhabited it, the city of Grozny, to which, for the first time after the war, a Russian girl comes to see her native home, return to her childhood and \"die in it\", saying goodbye to him forever for all those who lost their home and homeland.","popularity":0.0911,"poster_path":"/yL0BmQyWQUmXt1fBDat9y6ZvBd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126427,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nizhne-Volzhskaya Newsreel Studio","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2006-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Collecting Shadows","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Sobirateli teney","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1994015,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ivan Finogeev","original_name":"Ivan Finogeev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df262948d77c40015da8dbe","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1398297,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariya Kravchenko","original_name":"Мария Кравченко","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":"/jVJqn6o9OgaEvhN31P0l00827ZI.jpg","credit_id":"5df2628aa284eb00135a4592","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1398297,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariya Kravchenko","original_name":"Мария Кравченко","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":"/jVJqn6o9OgaEvhN31P0l00827ZI.jpg","credit_id":"5df26285a284eb00135a458d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vPlSnFLLiUq3VKnzVLi3YJOD90r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/yL0BmQyWQUmXt1fBDat9y6ZvBd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Art Doc Fest","release_date":"2006-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
