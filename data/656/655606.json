She has just learned that hundreds of synthetic toxins are now found in every baby born in America and the government and chemical corporations are doing little to protect citizens and consumers. With guidance from world-renowned physicians and environmental leaders, interviews with scientists and politicians, and stories of everyday Americans, Soozie uncovers how we got to be so overloaded with chemicals and if there is anything we can do to take control of our exposure.","popularity":0.2819,"poster_path":"/zheRSqYlhD885GVAjG6K9i10Rfe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Can we hit the reset button, or is it too late?","title":"Overload: America's Toxic Love Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2481983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Soozie Eastman","original_name":"Soozie Eastman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5df455609450fe0011230e90","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2481983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Soozie Eastman","original_name":"Soozie Eastman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df4549e9450fe0013231bb2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2481984,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Aleksandar Marinovich","original_name":"Aleksandar Marinovich","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df454f5048638001902a93c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2481985,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sebastian Chang","original_name":"Sebastian Chang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df4551b26dac100124e087a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2481986,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leah Streetman","original_name":"Leah Streetman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df4553c4a4bf6001454c289","department":"Sound","job":"Music Supervisor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6101430","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":2181,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zheRSqYlhD885GVAjG6K9i10Rfe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1545}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6305,"name":"pollution"},{"id":237198,"name":"toxin"},{"id":255655,"name":"chemical industry"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bullfrog Films presents...Overload: America's Toxic Love Story","key":"351662969","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-08-02T17:13:08.000Z","id":"5df456c34a4bf6001454c472"}]}}}
