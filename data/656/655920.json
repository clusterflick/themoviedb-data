The only surviving print is a black and white workprint from the color original. Since black-and-white positive film stock was not full-color sensitive, warm colors (like skin tones) print dark, hence the dark complexion of the actors in the film.","popularity":0.1055,"poster_path":"/cqS5UxH45XzyHOoRg26cBURCTj6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19710,"logo_path":"/9sPn1XGgKkLvWTbH1wdqML6AA1h.png","name":"LVN Pictures","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"1960-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Festival in Rhythm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":180701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Sedaka","original_name":"Neil Sedaka","popularity":0.3182,"profile_path":"/1UC3TLWBStFb9Q190EoZ08T5UIZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5df6721bd1a893001279a5b4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1531827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lita Gutierrez","original_name":"Lita Gutierrez","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62dcb358957e6d004e9b3754","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2761245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diomedes Maturan","original_name":"Diomedes Maturan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/5ZZqXdm5P764ed4MBeZnzk6Tfur.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"62dcb366c439c006a49ea520","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1288363,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leroy Salvador","original_name":"Leroy Salvador","popularity":0.091,"profile_path":"/kW8k8158qrMEgHHXMAlL2ujF0Sp.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"62dcb36eea84c7004fc640b2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1345940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Bonnin","original_name":"Bernard Bonnin","popularity":0.1577,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"62dcb3764ccc50004d1c6da0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3635223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy Donato","original_name":"Guy Donato","popularity":0.0534,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"62dcb37fe323f3036c0f2394","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3407837,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hector Reyes","original_name":"Hector Reyes","popularity":0.1452,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"62dcb38adc1cb4004fab9da0","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3360035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noel Villaroman","original_name":"Noel Villaroman","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"62dcb39458361b004fbda25b","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1828206,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Natoy B.
