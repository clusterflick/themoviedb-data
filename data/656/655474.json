Without Edgar's consent, Florence, mother and brother have decided that Edgar will temporarily move in with brother, while mother will temporarily move in with Florence, giving mother's room to her visiting brother, Wilbur. Uncle Wilbur, an entrepreneur, promises to set brother up in one of his companies, making Edgar's dream come true of getting brother out of his house. But chain smoking Uncle Wilbur vows to renege on his promise unless Edgar can get him some cigarettes after he himself runs out. Edgar may have some problems as there is a cigarette shortage, every smoker clamoring for what few supplies there are. If Edgar can't get cigarettes, he may have to resort to Plan B, which may not be as easy as he imagines. Regardless, lazy brother may do whatever he can to thwart Edgar's plans if only to remain unemployed and in Edgar's house.","popularity":0.2738,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":6,"logo_path":"/n53F7K9scQWFXYbrCablqLKqJdp.png","name":"RKO Radio Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1945-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What, No Cigarettes","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edgar Kennedy","original_name":"Edgar Kennedy","popularity":0.1961,"profile_path":"/oA8h7AdAUZYg5uO0xzFMQOkc9DQ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Edgar Kennedy","credit_id":"5df36b48fac502001183a69c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":103232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Lake","original_name":"Florence Lake","popularity":0.1871,"profile_path":"/8gMkdeMDR0ZjhZavHLaQYsBm235.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Florence Kennedy","credit_id":"5df36b5ad1a8930012737fa3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89672,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Conlin","original_name":"Jimmy Conlin","popularity":0.2106,"profile_path":"/fImzSAUll4h46mb7iPnjPlDHr3c.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Uncle Wilbur","credit_id":"5df36b6afac502001183a6fe","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":194924,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hal Yates","original_name":"Hal Yates","popularity":0.1723,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df36a974a4bf6001252da07","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0126726","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1945-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
