A chief flight instructor demonstrates the correct method of holding, carrying, and wearing the parachute, but Mac, a trainee who thinks he has all the answers already, fails to pay attention and finds himself in deep trouble. Lt. Taylor, another instructor, shows a more attentive pilot trainee through the process of inspection of the plane and engine. But for every step this trainee learns well, Mac is elsewhere showing what can happen when one doesn't pay attention.","popularity":0.167,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":16733,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wilding Picture Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1945-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Primary Flight Training: Before You Fly","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Taylor","original_name":"Robert Taylor","popularity":0.8819,"profile_path":"/kcuk9N9FubD8ISOyIgwRyUCQedH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lt.
