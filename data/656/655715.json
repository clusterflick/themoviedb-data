Home field advantage belonged to the 105-win Houston Astros, who were looking to take back a title they had won in 2017. The white-hot Washington Nationals were fighting for the first championship in franchise history. The Washington Nationals beat the Houston Astros in a most unpredictable Fall Classic, winning Game 7 with one last rally in a season full of rallies. For the first time in MLB history, the road team won all seven games in the World Series.","popularity":0.8796,"poster_path":"/uOv9Wm7K4YP8dgHhRT7McfqYE6b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11709,"logo_path":"/aJ2Y9GJNyxWWfMfOsaVXHXCHaDM.png","name":"Major League Baseball Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The 2019 World Series","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"2019 Washington Nationals: The Official World Series Film","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3018228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Craig Melvin","original_name":"Craig Melvin","popularity":0.1115,"profile_path":"/okEoGBNOihL9C9YSPQr3GdiEgF6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"63347edadd4716008bca8cb3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4015921,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan Soto","original_name":"Juan Soto","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"643e0b25e0ca7f04b506c3a5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3487050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Scherzer","original_name":"Max Scherzer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"643e0b6cc7176d04de986aa2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4015924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Strasburg","original_name":"Stephen Strasburg","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"643e0b93e0ca7f031306c431","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5260963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Zimmerman","original_name":"Ryan Zimmerman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":32,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67b8532e7434200c28227b56","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1985160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Bregman","original_name":"Alex Bregman","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/wXAfc1YaqbHAibk1ZAdOIBIEna2.jpg","cast_id":34,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67b85343a2284666f1eb4f62","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1985157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Correa","original_name":"Carlos Correa","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":35,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67b8537a7434200c28227bf3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2692721,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Doolittle","original_name":"Sean Doolittle","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":36,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67b853bb7434200c28227c10","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5260964,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Howie Kendrick","original_name":"Howie Kendrick","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":37,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67b853d97434200c28227c2a","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5260965,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Martinez","original_name":"Dave Martinez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":38,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67b853e8444dd7fcefba66a3","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1985165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"A.J.
