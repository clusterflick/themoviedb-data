It captures the drama as well as the ceremonial aspect of the work, despite sometimes cloudy recorded sound.” Gramophone Classical Music Guide. “Gardiner's second [recording of the Vespers], spectacularly recorded live in St Mark's, has a punchy choral sound, near-operatic solo singing (Bryn Terfel and Alistair Miles are among the basses), emphatic enunciation, big contrasts and deliberate exploitation of the building's spaces. Its outright theatricality sets it apart from other performances.","popularity":0.4116,"poster_path":"/jABh8E9DX6k6ZdYwtJP0SCXVKUh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1989-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latin","iso_639_1":"la","name":"Latin"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vespro Della Beata Vergine","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1338572,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Eliot Gardiner","original_name":"John Eliot Gardiner","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":"/pIHSar5WD1PlfynCuAn8PHuNvA2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5df0671ec5c1ef0013a145fd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2480005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann Monoyios","original_name":"Ann Monoyios","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Soprano","credit_id":"5df067416a34480012c77667","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2480006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marinella Pennicchi","original_name":"Marinella Pennicchi","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Soprano","credit_id":"5df0674b6a34480012c7768a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2480007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Tucker","original_name":"Mark Tucker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Tenor","credit_id":"5df067651dbc880016ac899c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2221850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nigel Robson","original_name":"Nigel Robson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Tenor","credit_id":"5df0677d1dbc880016ac89b7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2480008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandro Naglia","original_name":"Sandro Naglia","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Tenor","credit_id":"5df06790dc86470011c8afff","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1089261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryn Terfel","original_name":"Bryn Terfel","popularity":0.3201,"profile_path":"/7p8Mc0xuEARbPzWXQvrCl5oIR4T.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Bass","credit_id":"5df067a6f6fd180015eec9e4","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1365728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alastair Miles","original_name":"Alastair Miles","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Bass","credit_id":"5df067b0eda4b7001303fd22","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95914,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Claudio Monteverdi","original_name":"Claudio Monteverdi","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":"/jOCDfg8XQABcdgQUXe62yrnKT2y.jpg","credit_id":"5df0684e688cd0001222b177","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jABh8E9DX6k6ZdYwtJP0SCXVKUh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":258963,"name":"classical concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"T","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"la","note":"","release_date":"1989-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
