Guided by mysterious crow calls, they wander through a desolate urban landscape until they reach a zone of passage and are spirited to an ancient forest, the Realm of the Birds. Here they meet the Hoopoe, half-bird half-woman, who tells them how the birds live by sharing their resources amid the magical forces of the forest. However, one of the men has other plans for the birds. Though far from easy, the inter-species encounter will be illuminating for all.","popularity":0.1418,"poster_path":"/e9P7SaL5rKLK0XE1WOu7TAaG5ra.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103606,"logo_path":"/lqG6wxp78BX0j1P0fBAQoa22CzU.png","name":"Les Films du
