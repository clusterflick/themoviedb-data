This film version, shot on 16mm in the Lepercq Space at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1977, was created in partnership with the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts as part of their initiative to document ground-breaking live performance for future restaging. QUARRY centers on a sick American child (played by Monk herself) whose world darkens as her illness progresses, this darkening including the rise of a dictator. A unique document of this innovative, boundary-blurring production, and a work of art on its own terms, replete with a film-within-a-film directed by Monk in 1975.","popularity":0.1631,"poster_path":"/93qD7OoL78e28F2NZ0dXEA7Vvxv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178205,"logo_path":null,"name":"New York Public Library of Performing
