Their songs are mainly old Scandinavian ballads presented in a unique soundscape spiced with a haunting disturbing aspect. Chapbook stories who sneak up on you through eerie backwards fiddle, strings, programming, soundscapes, then the beats kick in, banging for dear life, and the cool, authoritative voice of Emma Härdelin floats over the top.","popularity":0.2918,"poster_path":"/jDcYBf63AEfGIrqGNnZ0vDUZzYf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126503,"logo_path":null,"name":"NorthSide Records","origin_country":""},{"id":126504,"logo_path":null,"name":"Massproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Garmarna: From Hamlet to Hildegard","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2482120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefan Brisland-Ferner","original_name":"Stefan Brisland-Ferner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Strings/Programming","credit_id":"5df4961e26dac100144ecb7f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2482121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Härdelin","original_name":"Emma Härdelin","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/6ZBrtEUAmN3WQR8VPODo5fviN8A.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Vocals/Violin","credit_id":"5df49630d1a8930014764340","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2482122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jens Höglin","original_name":"Jens Höglin","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Percussion","credit_id":"5df496484a4bf60017559b81","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2482123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gotte Ringqvist","original_name":"Gotte Ringqvist","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Guitars","credit_id":"5df4965cd1a8930019763ff5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2482124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rickard Westman","original_name":"Rickard Westman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Guitars/e-bow","credit_id":"5df496709450fe0013238cc0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2482125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iain Ross","original_name":"Iain Ross","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"e-bow","credit_id":"5df496824a4bf60014553843","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2482112,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jerry Nelson","original_name":"Jerry Nelson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df4969426dac100174ea057","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2482112,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jerry Nelson","original_name":"Jerry Nelson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df496a30486380014035c6f","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2482113,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert Simonds","original_name":"Robert Simonds","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df496c29450fe001523907c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2482113,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert Simonds","original_name":"Robert Simonds","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df496cd9450fe00152390a1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2482121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Härdelin","original_name":"Emma Härdelin","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/6ZBrtEUAmN3WQR8VPODo5fviN8A.jpg","credit_id":"5df496e3048638001203b5b1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2482120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefan Brisland-Ferner","original_name":"Stefan Brisland-Ferner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df496f7d1a8930019764109","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11439576","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/29y7k1cf87aUEnJUogZPc52gbo9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jDcYBf63AEfGIrqGNnZ0vDUZzYf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":260174,"name":"scandinavian folklore"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
