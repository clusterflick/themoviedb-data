The expression says: 'mourn'. This film tells us that it is mourning that makes us first. Martin Verdet's film, Donner le jour crosses this time which, from the death of his mother to the birth of his son, tangles day after day the material of mourning to the material of life. This film is a rare film, rare by the emotion it provokes, the quality of this emotion which is always nourished by a formal elaboration, a work on the form whose beauty immediately seizes us as an enigma and as a revelation.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2005-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Give Birth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":930302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Verdet","original_name":"Martin Verdet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df4b5d59450fe001523d0f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2005-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
