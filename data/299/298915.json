In an exciting full-length adventure straight out of a comic book, Power-Pants Pete swoops down and starts shrinking everything insight down to teeny-tiny size. To save the day, Professor Von Drake transforms the Clubhouse Gang into super heroes with incredible powers.

Only by working together, with help from you... and the right Mouseketools.","popularity":2.7266,"poster_path":"/chSBBHM6gJckFIQQq3NhCPnux2L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":670,"logo_path":"/rRGi5UkwvdOPSfr5Xf42RZUsYgd.png","name":"Walt Disney
