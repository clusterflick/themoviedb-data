In reality, the mall Santa in your cherished children's photo has problems just like the rest of us. Even the jolliest of men fall victim to divorce, job loss, insecurity and even the occasional hangover. 'I Am Santa Claus' is a documentary that follows the lives of five real-bearded professional Santa Clauses as they anticipate and prepare the coming holiday season while showing them for who they actually are flawed, flesh and blood men who feel an overbearing responsibility to protect the integrity of the spotless, untarnished reputation of the \"Red Suit.\"","popularity":1.5754,"poster_path":"/vX6SHkpnYragzBjAG5UwuVfvQSP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70839,"logo_path":null,"name":"Double Windsor
