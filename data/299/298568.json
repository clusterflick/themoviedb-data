One day, his future son-in-law, the jeweler Fabian, is arrested on suspicion of murder on the day before his wedding.  He is said to have murdered his ex-wife, the dancer Ria Norady.  The conductor Gillmore found her dead in her dressing room shortly after a visit from Fabian.  Gisela Jordan asks her father to defend him.  After speaking to Fabian, the lawyer is convinced he's innocent.  But since there is no proof of this, he decides to go and try and find the real murderer himself.","popularity":0.2377,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7448,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tobis Filmkunst","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1944-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Verteidiger hat das Wort","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Plädoyer","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinrich George","original_name":"Heinrich George","popularity":0.157,"profile_path":"/pG7HbJEVnG44wOL1kgaeTVZbzL7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Justizrat Jordan","credit_id":"5446c6f30e0a26632d00bde4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1306340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carla Rust","original_name":"Carla Rust","popularity":0.092,"profile_path":"/pfjNzb5kmP4IIA9dtxPkaVfaa0M.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Giesela Jordan","credit_id":"5446c700c3a36836d4002ec9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolf Fernau","original_name":"Rudolf Fernau","popularity":0.1528,"profile_path":"/iEszwwXgPjC9U3RNbLDkXWu7Ua6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Günther Fabian","credit_id":"5446c7220e0a26633a00bf19","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36852,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Schönböck","original_name":"Karl Schönböck","popularity":0.2629,"profile_path":"/iVtXcswSQwAyreXPMopbtamaX5O.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jack Gillmoore","credit_id":"5446c7300e0a26633a00bf1e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2734,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margit Symo","original_name":"Margit Symo","popularity":0.0438,"profile_path":"/zLpxMT1zWfEKyz6S3XLXy8lGuRJ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ria Nora","credit_id":"5446c73f0e0a26633000bf14","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claus Clausen","original_name":"Claus Clausen","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/7gR9AJQzKrjiapcPzqMmxAMiL59.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Staatsanwalt","credit_id":"55fff7919251412950002673","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1458411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisabeth Schwarzkopf","original_name":"Elisabeth Schwarzkopf","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Sängerin","credit_id":"55fff7a19251412950002675","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1531776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Meyer-Hanno","original_name":"Hans Meyer-Hanno","popularity":0.0402,"profile_path":"/dd5I7RjKlifu8x0ZCHHHV1gbCM5.jpg","cast_id":21,"character":"Herr Böttger","credit_id":"5a31b4e59251415472009461","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1954041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernstwalter Mitulski","original_name":"Ernstwalter Mitulski","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"","credit_id":"5a4ed977c3a3683bc6003920","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":46848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carsta Löck","original_name":"Carsta Löck","popularity":0.1504,"profile_path":"/jhBUeOC5z88QugMmEyrAlFhFKoA.jpg","cast_id":24,"character":"","credit_id":"5b09f26f0e0a260e4200007e","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1422506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Reigbert","original_name":"Claire Reigbert","popularity":0.0592,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":25,"character":"Ida","credit_id":"5b09f27cc3a3684b72000053","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Werner Klingler","original_name":"Werner Klingler","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":"/529tagupvMybLZxGmVuRh8uKW5.jpg","credit_id":"5446c6cbc3a368216a0010ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":18503,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Harald G.
