Angela, however, has to get married as soon as possible because as a foreigner she will lose her work permit if she does not become a German citizen soon. The couple then come up with the idea of ​​​​marrying Angela to the German bachelor Jonny Pitter, a writer - a sham marriage with no dishonorable consequences, of course. What neither Angela nor Prof. Hollmann suspect is that Jonny has been in love with Angela for some
