On the way to Hannes Kleebauer's horse stud in Austria, she meets the likeable blonde Danish woman Lil, who gives her a lift in her car. Kleebauer is a handsome, middle-aged man and widowed. He would like to get married again, but his jealous, underage daughter Christl is rebellious and has nothing better to do than scare off any potential marriage candidates as subtly as possible. And so, as expected, Marianne and Lil don't have an easy time of it when they arrive at Kleebauer's horse farm.","popularity":0.2844,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1975-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ich denk', mich tritt ein Pferd","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":33709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uschi Glas","original_name":"Uschi Glas","popularity":0.3381,"profile_path":"/pLtYUsfQk1HjIpCYud1Ohylz8tE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Marianne Neuhaus","credit_id":"544b96e10e0a2651b3001ef8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Cramer","original_name":"Michael Cramer","popularity":0.1779,"profile_path":"/hamNposI86WfmV6ip6BjRCZxM4Z.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hannes Kleebauer","credit_id":"544b975ec3a3680fb4006e72","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1080578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Nielsen","original_name":"Barbara Nielsen","popularity":0.2359,"profile_path":"/kaX7cncaLuKuPWSjHR9jbygiHJT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lil","credit_id":"544b97bbc3a3680fb8006cee","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maxi Böhm","original_name":"Maxi Böhm","popularity":0.1105,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Inspektor Vrtil","credit_id":"544b97cc0e0a267486006b9d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22531,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert Fux","original_name":"Herbert Fux","popularity":0.2508,"profile_path":"/6fxgv19OAVQjGUSRODwRczPtZ55.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"544b97d8c3a3680fb4006e8a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz Muxeneder","original_name":"Franz Muxeneder","popularity":0.1894,"profile_path":"/nBJSWzQ1prFQIaTKe37SYJUUR30.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"544b97e3c3a3680fc30061c5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernst H.
