Wolff traces the source of the economic crisis to the 1970s, when wages began to stagnate and American workers were forced into a dysfunctional spiral of borrowing and debt that ultimately exploded in the mortgage meltdown. By placing the crisis within this larger historical and systemic frame, Wolff argues convincingly that the proposed government \"bailouts,\" stimulus packages, and calls for increased market regulation will not be enough to address the real causes of the crisis, in the end suggesting that far more fundamental change will be necessary to avoid future catastrophes.","popularity":0.3228,"poster_path":"/up0H58JhZj9I1se01FD3HkVNPtP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Capitalism Hits the Fan","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1306357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Wolff","original_name":"Richard Wolff","popularity":0.0973,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"himself","credit_id":"5449f39d0e0a2674830032cb","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1306357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Wolff","original_name":"Richard Wolff","popularity":0.0973,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5449f3c70e0a26747c00330c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1184450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sut Jhally","original_name":"Sut Jhally","popularity":0.0778,"profile_path":"/a06JwBtL1mO2rQM2jILcvTf6NUX.jpg","credit_id":"5449f3bbc3a3680fb4003584","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2079483","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.652,"height":782,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/up0H58JhZj9I1se01FD3HkVNPtP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":510}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":592,"name":"capitalism"},{"id":3681,"name":"economy"},{"id":11061,"name":"debt"},{"id":14737,"name":"economics"},{"id":156181,"name":"lecture"},{"id":165193,"name":"financial crisis"},{"id":189933,"name":"economic crisis"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
