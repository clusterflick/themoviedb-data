These are all original recordings, with nothing ironed out or added at the studio. Everything was recorded in top quality, filmed with 6 HD cameras plus camera crane in 5.1 surround sound. When it came to the mix, Funker Vogt put a lot of emphasis on the live atmosphere, so for the first time, the familiar Funker Vogt hits are presented on DVDs the way weve known and loved them for years. But thats not nearly all: the second DVD includes Wrestling, Shotguns, Trailer Parks, a 105-minute film, and performances at the Mera Luna festivals 2002, 2004 and 2006.","popularity":0.07,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Funker Vogt - Warzone K17, Live In Berlin","video":true,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4344,"name":"musical"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
