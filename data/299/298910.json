After experiencing boundless sensuality and freedom with the fun-loving Venus (soprano), the singer Tannhäuser (Tenor) finds it impossible to conform to the cultured setting of his betrothed Elizabeth (soprano), who loves him. During a singing contest, Tannhäuser describes the affair with Venus as the ultimate love experience and because of that, he is cast out from the established society. Thanks to Elizabeth's intervention, he is allowed to undertake a pilgrimage to the Pope to ask for the Holy Father's pardon. If the Pope accepts to forgive him, he would be allowed to take back his place in society. Tannhäuser accepts. But fate will not allow him to meet with his beloved Elizabeth again in this life. This is a recording of the legendary staging by Götz Friedrich for the 1978 Bayreuth Festival conducted by Sir Colin Davis.","popularity":0.7535,"poster_path":"/3fTQWyls85CwS8JRQ71qs48Zke1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1978-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":209,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tannhäuser and the Singers' Contest at Wartburg Castle","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1109283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gwyneth Jones","original_name":"Gwyneth Jones","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/ehIPPH2vINJAPNHgoHe2vHvUg5t.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Elisabeth / Venus","credit_id":"544a9a18c3a3680fae0047a5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1377318,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Spas Wenkoff","original_name":"Spas Wenkoff","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/qmCt5yr7FcESMypwCO3bEbV6DMN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tannhäuser","credit_id":"544a9a4bc3a3680fb4004ac5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1377320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernd Weikl","original_name":"Bernd Weikl","popularity":0.0968,"profile_path":"/r8NkIhBstdKCq1FPqE1yn8sRVCu.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Wolfram von Eschenbach","credit_id":"544a9a770e0a26748c004797","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1377321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Sotin","original_name":"Hans Sotin","popularity":0.056,"profile_path":"/fjlkAstdGHYPBBIDYbvo4f0M1fl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Landgraf","credit_id":"544a9a87c3a3680fb80049e7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1377322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Schunk","original_name":"Robert Schunk","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/oSeOceX6DCmDHd9SdGMsw9jWoDp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Walther von der Vogelweide","credit_id":"544a9a9a0e0a26748c00479e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1160685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz Mazura","original_name":"Franz Mazura","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/33XAcjIcojfjq92fGAX6GslMCRa.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Biterolf","credit_id":"59cbd1d0c3a368774e011213","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1724240,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"John Pickering","original_name":"John Pickering","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Heinrich der Schreiber","credit_id":"59cbd1fbc3a3687797014f59","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1895708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinz Feldhoff","original_name":"Heinz Feldhoff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Reinmar von Zweter","credit_id":"59cbd2099251412b98013d58","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1564128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klaus Brettschneider","original_name":"Klaus Brettschneider","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Ein junger Hirt","credit_id":"59cbd21ec3a368773d015584","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1895709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irene Hammann","original_name":"Irene Hammann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Edelknaben","credit_id":"59cbd23e9251412bd90136e4","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1895710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angelika Jung-Nowski","original_name":"Angelika Jung-Nowski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Edelknaben","credit_id":"59cbd2529251412b8b014972","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1895711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roswitha Korff-Krüger","original_name":"Roswitha Korff-Krüger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Edelknaben","credit_id":"59cbd25f9251412be1012a47","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1895712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natuse von Stegmann","original_name":"Natuse von Stegmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Edelknaben","credit_id":"59cbd2799251412bb301361a","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1455920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Davis","original_name":"Colin Davis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bzeZgEDAEmpHGerdCDRIAEmh70F.jpg","cast_id":22,"character":"Self -
