On the road, we slowly discover his real intentions, and the significance of what is hidden inside a young boy's bag.","popularity":0.747,"poster_path":"/ciJUuscjemGhaMCbwnyqZG6Zh94.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bag Man","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1377178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judah Bellamy","original_name":"Judah Bellamy","popularity":0.1933,"profile_path":"/p0GktC9tJA8JIEjfU3w4BE6Bq5Q.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Boy","credit_id":"544a37dfc3a3680fa5003bd7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1377052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raushanah Simmons","original_name":"Raushanah Simmons","popularity":0.1624,"profile_path":"/34KPCwsfrqzQBypmgglEMscX2R2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"544a37fb0e0a267479003ac8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1413052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pablo Gonzales","original_name":"Pablo Gonzales","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"54b51620c3a368094e009436","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1413053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Frederic","original_name":"Michael Frederic","popularity":0.0995,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"54b5162fc3a36805d3004230","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":454210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"P.J.
