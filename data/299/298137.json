Filmed in color and b&amp;w on 16mm film, it continues Salmon's interest in the performance of the artist/cinematographer within both spontaneous and constructed situations and incorporates methods developed by various movements within documentary and avant-garde history. Using an array of sounds, music and conversation as well as silence, Salmon constructs an abstract documentary which both develops and challenges the themes presented in Maslow's theory as well as her own interest in human iconography, stereotype and domestic rhythm. The image of Maslow's pyramid and his pragmatic dissection of human needs and possible motivations provide a system of organization for the family and a philosophical framework for the video.","popularity":0.0604,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":45746,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cine Wiand","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pyramid","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1375295,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alban Cocking","original_name":"Alban Cocking","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"544317270e0a26632d0034b0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1375296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arlo Cocking","original_name":"Arlo Cocking","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5443172fc3a3683e0e0034db","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1375297,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ben Cocking","original_name":"Ben Cocking","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"54431735c3a3683df7003411","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1375298,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Emily Guille-Marrett","original_name":"Emily Guille-Marrett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"54431740c3a3683e0b003431","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1375299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philomena Salmon Wiand","original_name":"Philomena Salmon Wiand","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5443174b0e0a26632d0034bc","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1375301,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dino Wiand","original_name":"Dino Wiand","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54431780c3a3683df2003528","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1375300,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Margaret Salmon","original_name":"Margaret Salmon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54431758c3a3683e050034b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1375300,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Margaret Salmon","original_name":"Margaret Salmon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5443176c0e0a26633d0034eb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1375298,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Emily Guille-Marrett","original_name":"Emily Guille-Marrett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"544317a0c3a3683e0e0034f1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1375300,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Margaret Salmon","original_name":"Margaret Salmon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"544317bac3a3683e0e0034f8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1375300,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Margaret Salmon","original_name":"Margaret Salmon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"544317ab0e0a26633d0034fa","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1375297,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ben Cocking","original_name":"Ben Cocking","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54431793c3a3683df2003530","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1375300,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Margaret Salmon","original_name":"Margaret Salmon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"544317c9c3a3683e050034c7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4027292","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BFI London Film Festival","release_date":"2014-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
