One of the duties he performed was to carry amputated limbs to the cremation furnace. This is a film about the collective madness that engulfed Sarajevo. A one-armed boy is troubled because he can't make big, firm snowballs; a man who lost both legs demonstrates walking on his stumps... The film and the director's story help us understand the commotion and tumult that have occurred in the minds of Sarajevans.","popularity":0.0561,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":35928,"logo_path":null,"name":"SaGa Production","origin_country":"BA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BA","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"}],"release_date":"1993-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bosnian","iso_639_1":"bs","name":"Bosanski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Burned Legs","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1030481,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Srđan Vuletić","original_name":"Srđan Vuletić","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"562a9ff2925141284a002d12","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1376375,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Oliver Todorović","original_name":"Oliver Todorović","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5446af1ac3a3683e0500b6cf","department":"Crew","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":573606,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ademir Kenović","original_name":"Ademir Kenović","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/46h00mX9UAVrsEWQe5DrcIiZ6pf.jpg","credit_id":"5446af2b0e0a26633000ba4e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1040466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ahmed Imamović","original_name":"Ahmed Imamović","popularity":0.0599,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5446af610e0a2661af002d9b","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":77591,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ismet Arnautalić","original_name":"Ismet Arnautalić","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5446af38c3a3683df700b705","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1334942,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Almir Kenović","original_name":"Almir Kenović","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5446af4ac3a36836d4002a90","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1376376,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"E.
