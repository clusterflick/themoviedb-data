Through their stories the film tries to give a picture of youngsters who live in the war for three and a half years and their efforts to overcome the trauma. The stories are seemingly separate, but the thread that connects them is a three-year-old boy who on his tricycle constantly wanders the streets of Sarajevo, passing everywhere and always seeing everything. He takes us from one child to another, opening up before us a picture of the bizarre life of children in Sarajevo.","popularity":0.1335,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":35928,"logo_path":null,"name":"SaGa Production","origin_country":"BA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BA","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"}],"release_date":"1995-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bosnian","iso_639_1":"bs","name":"Bosanski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children Like Any Other","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1376378,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adis Hasić","original_name":"Adis Hasić","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5446b10fc3a3683e0100ba98","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1376379,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jasena Hadžović","original_name":"Jasena Hadžović","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5446b11dc3a36836d4002adb","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1376380,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Milenko Uherka","original_name":"Milenko Uherka","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5446b162c3a3683e0500b732","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":573606,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ademir Kenović","original_name":"Ademir Kenović","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/46h00mX9UAVrsEWQe5DrcIiZ6pf.jpg","credit_id":"5446b1470e0a2661c8002e01","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1334942,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Almir Kenović","original_name":"Almir Kenović","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5446b12d0e0a26633d00ba69","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":77591,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ismet Arnautalić","original_name":"Ismet Arnautalić","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5446b13c0e0a26633000bab1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1376380,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Milenko Uherka","original_name":"Milenko Uherka","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5446b1820e0a2661c8002e0d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1082084,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pjer Žalica","original_name":"Pjer Žalica","popularity":0.1165,"profile_path":"/rLXyqtNtuQNZdX4FeM79nAg5gjW.jpg","credit_id":"5446b1720e0a26632d00b9cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
