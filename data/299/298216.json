The place shown is a part of a house in the country. Doors and windows are continually shown, emphasizing the film's concern with framing. Other images are present: city-scapes of a particularly sinister nature, implying a sense of ruin, and shots of a chorus on a stage. These shots begin and end the film which is accompanied by a vocal chant on the soundtrack.","popularity":0.0976,"poster_path":"/tKH89tj8DCdyh0BqCUYIQLbFXal.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19322,"logo_path":null,"name":"Werner Nekes Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1974-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kaskara","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69060,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Werner Nekes","original_name":"Werner Nekes","popularity":0.0941,"profile_path":"/wc3DqK6qU7XYXVqWuAFOTeQtphX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5443c34fc3a3683e0b004de8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1037929,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dore O.","original_name":"Dore O.","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/aqs4hsNBxdZug5EpAcrrMrrQp0b.jpg","credit_id":"5443c331c3a3683e01004e54","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1685602,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anthony Moore","original_name":"Anthony Moore","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/llWS3ACn6IcSliIhTAOY70UMElq.jpg","credit_id":"5fa223debcf8c900343dc02c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0314262","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wdFhn4J2LsSrErDjbAtx2tJMbUc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":1123,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rY37ZWY43QKLiOubH37C2SDdFby.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1521,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tKH89tj8DCdyh0BqCUYIQLbFXal.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7tKiZnbHpW5Zo4DYIYGHWDsgDWG.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1499,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fkrM8vtSNE1FljPCxIuxwFRxgne.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Knokke Experimental Film Festival","release_date":"1974-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
