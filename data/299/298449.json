Clark Kant is a mild-mannered Christian teenager with a super secret. Through light-hearted humor, the Super Christian series sets out to teach us something about Christian growth. In the first installment of Super Christian, we find that Clark Kant lives in two different worlds. During the week, Clark follows the standards of the world. \"Why not?\" he asks himself. \"Isn't everybody doing it?\" But on Sunday, in his Super Christian Best, Clark presents quite a different image. Then Clark learns through a friend that the Christian faith is for every day of the week, not just for Sundays.","popularity":0.0771,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":35880,"logo_path":null,"name":"John Schmidt Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Clark Cant, Mild Mannered Christianâ€¦ During The Week He's Just Like Anybody Else But On Sunday, Things Are Different!","title":"Super Christian","video":false,"vote_average":2.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1376093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Schmidt","original_name":"Jim Schmidt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Clark Kant","credit_id":"54457784c3a3683e0b008350","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1603491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chuck Bolte","original_name":"Chuck Bolte","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Jim","credit_id":"6659bd9613505dcecc5093af","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1331256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Schmidt","original_name":"John Schmidt","popularity":0.072,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54457767c3a3683df7008345","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3286259,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Schmidt","original_name":"John Schmidt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61790374b458b80030530102","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1331256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Schmidt","original_name":"John Schmidt","popularity":0.072,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617903a7a579f90066353ef0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3286262,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Maddux","original_name":"David Maddux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61790406a097dc002aa72dd2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1331256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Schmidt","original_name":"John Schmidt","popularity":0.072,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6179042c678259008fd42025","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3286265,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Judy Bannister","original_name":"Judy Bannister","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61790476e323f30025941d82","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3286266,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Patty Hambrick","original_name":"Patty Hambrick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617904aff85958002a4b26dd","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1530362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel White","original_name":"Mel White","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":"/xplT1IBctuIJYzRw4maj4rOdGy7.jpg","credit_id":"617904fe71f0950061a7b7a5","department":"Crew","job":"Creative Consultant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0461592","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9715,"name":"superhero"},{"id":11001,"name":"religion"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
