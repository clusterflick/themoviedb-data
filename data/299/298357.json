And while Hammer may be best-known for their notorious series of gory Dracula movies, bloody Frankenstein adventures and chilling, satanic epics, few films had a greater impact on the '60's than the unforgettable genre known as \"Hammer Glamours.\"  The \"Hammer Glamour\" epics delivered their own singular vision of history -- and especially pre-history -- with liberal doses of both flesh and fantasy.  With special effects as eye-popping as the actresses, these films created puberty's essential bridge between the thrill of cool monsters and the sensation of gorgeous women.  If you're a student of anthropology, this is a world you may not recognize.  But if you're looking for a twisted vision of the past that only Hammer can provide, you've come to the right place.  The Hammer Glamour legacy lives, and indeed the world has never been the same.","popularity":0.1821,"poster_path":"/q0uNcBqcvChPSabN2UnQ6VA6YoY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4318,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anchor Bay Home Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":1314,"logo_path":"/gQBluDqe6dc2ZdzfJbabEHoSGoG.png","name":"Hammer Film Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1994-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The World of Hammer: Lands Before Time","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Reed","original_name":"Oliver Reed","popularity":1.1483,"profile_path":"/hKqUr03saj4GSIpRbeYkCQpMNal.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5444f4f30e0a26633a00773e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62987,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Sidaway","original_name":"Robert Sidaway","popularity":0.1483,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5444f54fc3a36848940016eb","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":62985,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ashley Sidaway","original_name":"Ashley Sidaway","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5444f543c3a36848940016e9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":30572,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roy Skeggs","original_name":"Roy Skeggs","popularity":0.166,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5444f57cc3a36848940016f4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62987,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Sidaway","original_name":"Robert Sidaway","popularity":0.1483,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5444f52e0e0a26632d0075e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0801125","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/q0uNcBqcvChPSabN2UnQ6VA6YoY.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
