A couple of entertaining interviews, a photo gallery, and a short (and, sadly, very poorly narrated) documentary on the band's history complete the portrait.","popularity":0.398,"poster_path":"/hMO6BQnXMjCGPCTrBDTlkkJlO1f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21314,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Music Colombia","origin_country":"CO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2003-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":344,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"1977-1982 The Complete Jam on Film","title":"The Complete Jam","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":208637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Weller","original_name":"Paul Weller","popularity":0.156,"profile_path":"/3dOUHcW9YM9JBlkpPjdXJ1hdmON.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a9060d3925141334f000081","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1509710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Foxton","original_name":"Bruce Foxton","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a9060e1925141334f00008c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1509711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Buckler","original_name":"Rick Buckler","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/bqjIUgufCre79MdCajYo5zhiTQA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a9060ec0e0a26096c0000b9","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6yKHBV4co4dvUygPqIgLvLlhvRT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hMO6BQnXMjCGPCTrBDTlkkJlO1f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476},{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jACZ7E40Hzf3rHc5NNtxlUBSxos.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":4470,"name":"punk rock"},{"id":5699,"name":"music video"},{"id":8843,"name":"mods"},{"id":212520,"name":"pub rock"},{"id":212625,"name":"power pop"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
