She elopes with the maharajah to India. Much to her chagrin, she finds herself installed in his harem there, and even though she is accorded the status of being his favourite wife, she does not have her freedom. One day, Elly eyes an opportunity to escape her captivity. But will the Maharajah ever let her go? Or perhaps it is not the walls of the palace that are holding Elly back?
