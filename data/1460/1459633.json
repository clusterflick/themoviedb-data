As well as being very funny, it is also quite thought provoking. The trio travels through Canada, Turkey, Israel, Jordan and finally Washington DC interviewing \"regular people\" for their comments on the impending war.\r This film won best documentary at the 2003 Whistler Film Festival in Canada.","popularity":0.1027,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":12113,"logo_path":"/lwnLVleFG0sRAYBq5IObgN30r9F.png","name":"CBC","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2004-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"To understand the present we must remember the past...","title":"Baghdad or Bust","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2138963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Frame","original_name":"Matt Frame","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"self","credit_id":"67f1103b2f7d437027998bd2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2138963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Frame","original_name":"Matt Frame","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f11045ede8d82f3bad61de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2138963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Frame","original_name":"Matt Frame","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f1104dcbd55b661fd96aa0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":62904,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Adam Bowick","original_name":"Adam Bowick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f1106eede8d82f3bad61e7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5350393,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Gordon","original_name":"Paul Gordon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f110ef931ce174a2d9888f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5350394,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hans Schnabel","original_name":"Hans Schnabel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f111072f7d437027998be3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":62904,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Adam Bowick","original_name":"Adam Bowick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f111190c791beb57ad443d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2138963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Frame","original_name":"Matt Frame","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f11126ede8d82f3bad6230","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2628976,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Gordon","original_name":"Paul Gordon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f111488b1f32eb79d9672a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2138963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Frame","original_name":"Matt Frame","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f1116bf5a80aa545998c3c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0880603","wikidata_id":"Q4841829","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5939,"name":"iraq"},{"id":5894,"name":"bagdad"},{"id":18009,"name":"iran"},{"id":226547,"name":"war journalism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
