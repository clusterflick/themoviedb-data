The film immerses the viewer in everyday scenes: from a tender conversation between pregnant women in an underground maternity ward in Kyiv to the heart-wrenching funeral of a soldier in Lviv. From the tense preparation of soldiers in a frontline barracks to the breathtaking performance of a symphony orchestra in a basement in Kharkiv.  In Shelter, the audience is invited to step into a virtual space with people from Ukraine, to witness moments of shared humanity and reflect on the cost of war.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/miJn0nJwDWMiC1kxymDHM4jKLMm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":171944,"logo_path":null,"name":"Scopic","origin_country":""},{"id":255822,"logo_path":null,"name":"Malanka Studios","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2025-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shelter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"укриття","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2149169,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sjors Swierstra","original_name":"Sjors Swierstra","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67efa67a48d6f031b0acfddd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4626376,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ivanna Khitsinska","original_name":"Іванна Хіцінська","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67efa68eede8d82f3bad12c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35306594","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iiDCs2BC1RmBpC0WnyjhAKhefEu.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2054,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/miJn0nJwDWMiC1kxymDHM4jKLMm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1541}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
