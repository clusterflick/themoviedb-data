The film discusses the benefits of consistent wear and usage of the construction hard hat, the different available models of hard hats, as well as how to properly take care of your hard hat. Additionally the film briefly touches on the history of protective headgear from the Vikings to the Trojans to military helmets from World War I. This film was produced by Toronto, Canada based production company Rabko. The film was produced in a low-cost method, using still frames of photographs to achieve a narrative, so that is feels like a slideshow.","popularity":0.1661,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":258579,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rabko","origin_country":""},{"id":87240,"logo_path":null,"name":"Construction Safety Association of Ontario","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Use Your Head","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":33496,"name":"construction"},{"id":167877,"name":"hard hat"},{"id":188326,"name":"construction worker"},{"id":241542,"name":"public safety"},{"id":317735,"name":"helmet"},{"id":345309,"name":"public safety film"},{"id":345970,"name":"workplace safety"},{"id":349759,"name":"head gear"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Year is unknown","release_date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"“USE YOUR HEAD” 1970s CONSTRUCTION SAFETY TRAINING FILM   HEAD INJURIES ON THE JOB  HARD HATS 62544","key":"fe36_kEymnk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-08-15T19:29:51.000Z","id":"67f17355cbd55b661fd97f26"}]}}}
