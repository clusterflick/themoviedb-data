The plot centers on Crystal Janes, a young girl with an odd relationship to her dead brother. Typically moody and self absorbed, Crystal is nonetheless sensitive and smart. Growing up is hard enough in average families, let alone one still working through its grief and guilt. A strong performance by Marthe Bernard as Crystal helps to anchor the story in a strong sense of realism, ghostly presences and all.","popularity":0.583,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":192168,"logo_path":"/79892TUkSsRilVFc8sFgtT9Inix.png","name":"NIFCO","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Dare Not Go","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1374432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marthe Bernard","original_name":"Marthe Bernard","popularity":0.1231,"profile_path":"/heaFdYv2xcnQeqgxuKiiPHR9VsV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Crystal","credit_id":"67f0abcf8b1f32eb79d954ff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5349996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Aylward","original_name":"Johnny Aylward","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67f0abd766d70142b6996a50","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4292311,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary-Lynn Bernard","original_name":"Mary-Lynn Bernard","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67f0abe32f7d437027997625","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4361216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Cochrane","original_name":"Steve Cochrane","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67f0abe98b1f32eb79d9550e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1257491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John W.
