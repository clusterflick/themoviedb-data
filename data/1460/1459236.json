Horne A’Plenty is written as a tribute to one of the great Radio and TV performers, Kenneth Horne.  Two weeks before they were due to start the next series of Round the Horne, Kenneth Horne passed away. It was the 14th of February 1969. Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke had successfully written half of the fourth series with Barry Took, and had spent many months working on what would have comprised the fifth. Fast-forward 48 years, and Brian Cooke took these ‘pieces’ out of the drawers they’d been consigned to and read them all again. The show consists of many of those ‘pieces’, along with brand new material – and includes no less than four film parodies!","popularity":0.047,"poster_path":"/2dtqM28BOtJPHpxkHFt7XCyWir0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Horne A'Plenty","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1380295,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Rigby","original_name":"Jonathan Rigby","popularity":0.1224,"profile_path":"/zSuMbbYus8pUh7PZt1Qi0FM8g0y.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Kenneth Horne","credit_id":"67f003e7b3e035286cd956aa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1513013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robin Sebastian","original_name":"Robin Sebastian","popularity":0.061,"profile_path":"/okyXis8xZAD98VhC4R3csh9NYMD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Kenneth Williams","credit_id":"67f004018b1f32eb79d92c57","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1956132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Morley Hale","original_name":"David Morley Hale","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Hugh Paddick","credit_id":"67f0041fb3e035286cd956b3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1356913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Armstrong","original_name":"Charles Armstrong","popularity":0.107,"profile_path":"/yu9WMFZSdrSaHtHfgbgknrs9TPr.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Douglas Smith","credit_id":"67f0044c0c791beb57ad0129","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5349150,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Brown","original_name":"Kate Brown","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Betty Marsden","credit_id":"67f0049ca9313c7184ad1bcf","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5349154,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Kingsbury","original_name":"Michael Kingsbury","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f004f966d70142b6994a49","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5349156,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brian Cooke","original_name":"Brian Cooke","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f0051b66d70142b6994a59","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2tqPvb0WhBwHI7kwfLP499MNJSu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2dtqM28BOtJPHpxkHFt7XCyWir0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
