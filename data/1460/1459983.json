Contemporary women talk to characters from 100 years ago, reanimate their antics and emulate their mayhem moves. As early 21st century performers step into the clothes of their early 20th century counterparts, battling their haywire machines, exploding gags, and eruptive bodies, they learn to wield humour as a weapon against the structures that contain them today.","popularity":0.0588,"poster_path":"/n7DCGWKQEFd7dhjL1oPvprCFyGp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Breaking Plates","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2039205,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karen Pearlman","original_name":"Karen Pearlman","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f1ad8b0f20f9c45cad22fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt19072232","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n7DCGWKQEFd7dhjL1oPvprCFyGp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
