As if that wasn't enough, he finds himself falsely accused of robbery, and while escaping those phony charges he is chased and shot by a posse. Although wounded, he manages to elude the posse but takes his revenge by robbing a country store. It's not long before he has his own outlaw gang, with headquarters at the Spike S Ranch. A local sheriff is determined to capture him, so Al and his brother Frank make plans for one last, big robbery before leaving Oklahoma forever.\r â€”frankfob2@yahoo.com","popularity":0.055,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":176030,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thanhouser Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"},{"id":258599,"logo_path":null,"name":"Direct-From-Broadway Feature Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"From the Saturday Evening Post to the films","title":"Beating Back","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Dare Devil Jennings","type":"alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al J.
