With friends like the philosopher Jacques Derrida, the artist Adel Abdessemed, with Ariane Mnouchkine and her cosmopolitan theatre company, Cixous explores the wounds our time and allows us to ear the cry of literature. The history of dozens of members of her German-Jewish family who were assassinated in the Death Camps, and the trauma of the wars of decolonization are never far, for this major figure who was born in Algeria shortly before the start of the Second World War.","popularity":0.194,"poster_path":"/8yTGvgZTubZNMKSz8EeyaLTcLcR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ever, rêve, Helene Cixous","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2818745,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Matthieu Augustin","original_name":"Matthieu Augustin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646b704cc3514c2b085165c0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2274803,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier Morel","original_name":"Olivier Morel","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646b7064c3514c2b0bf35669","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1683604,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Rozenberg","original_name":"Paul Rozenberg","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646b7054d1857201802de4dd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2444906,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Florence Guinaudeau","original_name":"Florence Guinaudeau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646b705c54a09800feac2f8a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1296889,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Emmanuelle Collinot","original_name":"Emmanuelle Collinot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646b708554a09800e4102a12","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2343627,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jean-Gabriel Leynaud","original_name":"Jean-Gabriel Leynaud","popularity":0.0607,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646b70bc54a09800feac2fc5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1958666,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Céline Nusse","original_name":"Céline Nusse","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646b706fd18572012081fac4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1782226,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sarah Blum","original_name":"Sarah Blum","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/k5opSPZ2s2kXmwu3Gi8EDPlGsSn.jpg","credit_id":"646b707ed1857201019959dc","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1329709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cédric Dupire","original_name":"Cédric Dupire","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646b709a54a09800e4102a26","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2583253,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Gertrude Baillot","original_name":"Gertrude Baillot","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646b707854a0980155e2d344","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2274803,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier Morel","original_name":"Olivier Morel","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9b096f92514165c1f75db5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8565218","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8yTGvgZTubZNMKSz8EeyaLTcLcR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"18A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
