The proposal was to show the reality naked and raw, giving priority to controversial subjects, ghettos, underworlds and exhibiting strong scenes.  From 1989 to 1996, it was one of the most watched shows on Brazilian open television and ended up being a reference in television quality. The Special Document has won awards around the world, including the Prince Rainier Award at the Monte-Carlo TV Festival.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":50,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROGRAM OF ALL","title":"Special Document - The Poor Go To The Beach","video":true,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2277124,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nelson Hoineff","original_name":"Nelson Hoineff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9eccc9c3a3687344805740","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Documento Especial - Os Pobres Vão à Praia","key":"kOzGFJZZVe8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-08-27T14:47:51.000Z","id":"5c9ecb829251411a1e042f4b"}]}}}
