Finally, a call. His wife Claire is on the other side of the world on a beach at a luxury resort, drunk, also in the dark, but apparently with another man. An adulterous affair, or a life in danger? In the harrowing wait and frantic calls that follow, is it his marriage, his wife or his sanity that is most under threat? The telephone line is the single fragile thread that connects them. All Henry can do is to hang onto that phone.","popularity":0.4072,"poster_path":"/bsbwprBAnpYQHdd0LwbeckUTWfK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31052,"logo_path":"/pJgQoO1PyJdhOP1UOrVsDeolYw7.png","name":"Deutsche Film- und Fernsehakademie Berlin (DFFB)","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2011-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Long Distance Call","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arno Frisch","original_name":"Arno Frisch","popularity":0.2447,"profile_path":"/q9FvRaGueX9vUEnTcZJ3Ies5Ts5.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Henry","credit_id":"5c9ccae892514124c831020b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":225908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Bay","original_name":"Eva Bay","popularity":0.2262,"profile_path":"/v4UvWezF3jSfQnoJPXokyncZcsf.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Claire (voice)","credit_id":"5d033f530e0a2632c3cc5761","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2275828,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milek Knebel","original_name":"Milek Knebel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Dr. Hatami (voice)","credit_id":"5c9ccaf5c3a368180e26a70f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikolai Kinski","original_name":"Nikolai Kinski","popularity":0.4176,"profile_path":"/hN81FHqEqFjLvU0x4Cy4Zni4n1v.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Rezeptionist (voice)","credit_id":"5c9ccafb92514124e230fa0f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2275829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lenio Amory Einbeck","original_name":"Lenio Amory Einbeck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Lenn","credit_id":"5c9ccb020e0a2613f6eb5b51","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grzegorz Muskala","original_name":"Grzegorz Muskala","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9ccac30e0a2613f1eb6334","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1902117,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hannes Held","original_name":"Hannes Held","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9ccad5c3a368181726adb2","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grzegorz Muskala","original_name":"Grzegorz Muskala","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9ccabe0e0a2613fbeb6ed6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1357054,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Phillip Kaminiak","original_name":"Phillip Kaminiak","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9ccacd0e0a2613f1eb633f","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28547,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sol Bondy","original_name":"Sol Bondy","popularity":0.1063,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1ac0e9691cd5003497f9cf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grzegorz Muskala","original_name":"Grzegorz Muskala","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1ac102b3440900329e212a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1357054,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Phillip Kaminiak","original_name":"Phillip Kaminiak","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1ac0f341aac4003694ce78","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1967553","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bsbwprBAnpYQHdd0LwbeckUTWfK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2011-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
