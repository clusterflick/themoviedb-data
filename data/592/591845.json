Meanwhile, having just ended his engagement to Eugenia Abbott and now looking for rest and relaxation, the wealthy Robert Stanley also becomes a boarder at the aunt's, and he and Dimples quickly fall in love. Then a stock market panic puts a severe strain on Robert's assets, and he must get a lot of cash in order to avoid a disaster. Dimples finds out, takes the money from the doll, gives it to Robert's broker and, as a result, saves her sweetheart's financial empire. Once again solvent, Robert can let his mind move back to romance, and so he and Dimples start planning their marriage.","popularity":0.0855,"poster_path":"/nisY30p3ylaXMleN9Kwgr4lQNAv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dimples","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1127086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Miles Minter","original_name":"Mary Miles Minter","popularity":0.127,"profile_path":"/9iGZ1wyTXBHb4GRIE90dT5wP2zN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dimples","credit_id":"5c9eba9e9251411a1e0418dd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2277083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Cowper","original_name":"William Cowper","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Her Father","credit_id":"5c9ebaabc3a3687355802794","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2277084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John J.
