His journey to photograph the celestial wonders takes him from his home amongst the peaks of the Canadian Rockies to the wild, desert dunes of Namibia and remote ice caps of Greenland. Ever the adventurer, he must balance his work and passion for photography with his equal devotion as a family man. In the Starlight is an intimate portrayal of Paul's quest to capture the night skies, and what his time spent under the stars has taught him about life, love, adventure, and our place in the universe.","popularity":0.055,"poster_path":"/gHh1BYS0uVNjFOx9H5mJHTO2ryP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Starlight","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1316022,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mathieu Le Lay","original_name":"Mathieu Le Lay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9edd450e0a265977f79d6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8202656","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gHh1BYS0uVNjFOx9H5mJHTO2ryP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":705}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
