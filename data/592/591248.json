I've toured it round the world, added a full-on death metal backing band, expanded it, honed it and even written a bestselling book based on it.  Now it's time to film that show, so I can capture the magic and then finally put it to rest.  Yeah, I could do it shit and just upload it on YouTube and hope some of you see it.  But that's not good enough. Not for this show. Not for HEAVY METAL.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/2vJHjAGZyBeexQS2188alGJflS5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Andrew O'Neill's History of Heavy Metal","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2vJHjAGZyBeexQS2188alGJflS5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
