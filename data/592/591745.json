Andreas Goldstein, son of the GDR cultural functionary Klaus Gysi (1912–1999) has tackled this task with a complete lack of vanity, but with insistence: measured and calm, honest and intellectual, analytical and personal. He uncovers a mosaic that renounces both the teleologies of the self-styled winners of history and the simplifications of (West) German Oscar nominees. This film is not about the lives of others, but about his own life. Not about yesterday, about today, too.","popularity":0.1079,"poster_path":"/t82FKGXv8QZPqG7m1wdC0jXkKIa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Communist","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1073881,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jakobine Motz","original_name":"Jakobine Motz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612a5ad212197e008b74f37b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1717854,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chris Wright","original_name":"Chris Wright","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd17cecc3a368472ddb2235","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2094478,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andreas Goldstein","original_name":"Andreas Goldstein","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd17e99c3a3683b2ed8ffa3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2094478,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andreas Goldstein","original_name":"Andreas Goldstein","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd314cd28723c00174c5fac","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2094478,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andreas Goldstein","original_name":"Andreas Goldstein","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df1f9062cde9800162ee571","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":54253,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Heino Deckert","original_name":"Heino Deckert","popularity":0.1567,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df1f92018b7510012417b92","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1743043,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susanne Binninger","original_name":"Susanne Binninger","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df1f8fda284eb001759d2c3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10161390","wikidata_id":"Q61990183","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t82FKGXv8QZPqG7m1wdC0jXkKIa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":672}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2019-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
