WHISPERS AND SHOULDERS appropriates and reworks the raw footage of JOOJ's 'Shoulders and Whispers' music video. The video's images are rendered voiceless, with figures adrift in suspended animation for a twenty-six minute hypno-poetic reconstruction that draws upon unused images from the original music video. The initial video, 'Shoulders and Whispers,' is a black-and-white three-minute pop-song artifact designed to grab attention with each shot a fixed duration with a slow left-to-right pan. No shot is ever repeated. It has a forward momentum, unfolding new dynamics and imagery; conversely, WHISPERS AND SHOULDERS embraces repetitiveness in richly-saturated colour.","popularity":0.0536,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Whispers and Shoulders","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":19766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sook-Yin Lee","original_name":"Sook-Yin Lee","popularity":0.2156,"profile_path":"/eYv8kisLPUmjEGoB89FNojUkOBg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Specter","credit_id":"5c9ccdd3c3a368181d26b6f0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2178786,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adam Litovitz","original_name":"Adam Litovitz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Witness","credit_id":"5c9ccdda0e0a2613f6eb5df1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2275851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Syreeta Hector","original_name":"Syreeta Hector","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Angel","credit_id":"5c9ccde0c3a368180c26b3d1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2275852,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mairi Greig","original_name":"Mairi Greig","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Angel","credit_id":"5c9ccde8c3a368180c26b41f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2275853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chester Brown","original_name":"Chester Brown","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Father Time","credit_id":"5c9ccdee92514124cf30f77f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2275854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benjamin Kamino","original_name":"Benjamin Kamino","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Twin","credit_id":"5c9ccdf30e0a2613f1eb686f","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":19766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sook-Yin Lee","original_name":"Sook-Yin Lee","popularity":0.2156,"profile_path":"/eYv8kisLPUmjEGoB89FNojUkOBg.jpg","credit_id":"5c9ccdb50e0a2613edeb795e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2178786,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adam Litovitz","original_name":"Adam Litovitz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9ccdbf92514124c831064a","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4796088","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
