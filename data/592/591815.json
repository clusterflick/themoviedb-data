Magoo thinks that the flyer is a letter from his mother about her \"83rd birthday\" and begins to worry that maybe he hasn't spent enough time with his mother lately. He goes to pay his mother a visit to make up for lost time but upon arriving, Mother Magoo doesn't quite appreciate Magoo's attempts at being helpful such as baking a feather duster thinking it to be a turkey dinner. So she uses psychology to eventually persuade him to go back home (at least until next year).","popularity":0.2439,"poster_path":"/ltZBPnVQIVRAKMe1aX9Q7YQpdFG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8409,"logo_path":"/osYFlsgvFQXfEBAlvUgvWQHINLB.png","name":"United Productions of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1956-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meet Mother Magoo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pat Carroll","original_name":"Pat Carroll","popularity":0.5086,"profile_path":"/r7JwQ9wmolpgPUFz8iSmgPy0SbH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mother Magoo (voice)(uncredited)","credit_id":"5c9e96ba9251411a2103de70","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Backus","original_name":"Jim Backus","popularity":0.728,"profile_path":"/y2vIKLpjYlIo80sc5uvIpqEHn5n.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mr. Magoo (voice)","credit_id":"5c9e96c49251411a2803dd85","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225712,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Cecil Surrey","original_name":"Cecil Surrey","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6460b1c76e0d72015c0eba16","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1227465,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Herbert Klynn","original_name":"Herbert Klynn","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9e96fd0e0a265980f726f7","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1132354,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Gil Turner","original_name":"Gil Turner","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9e97399251411a1603dec2","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1313943,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Del Castillo","original_name":"Del Castillo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9e96f20e0a265989f71529","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2092140,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ed Nofziger","original_name":"Ed Nofziger","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9e96dc9251411a1c03e3f0","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1552494,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Bob McIntosh","original_name":"Bob McIntosh","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9e971ec3a36873597fed5e","department":"Art","job":"Other"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1799517,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Tom McDonald","original_name":"Tom McDonald","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9e97140e0a265983f71a70","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1113182,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stephen Bosustow","original_name":"Stephen Bosustow","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9e96eac3a36873557ff69d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224802,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pete Burness","original_name":"Pete Burness","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9e96d3c3a36873557ff696","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2277002,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Robert Dranko","original_name":"Robert Dranko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9e970ac3a368734a7ff2b8","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1799543,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Barney Posner","original_name":"Barney Posner","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9e9727c3a368735b7ff714","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0151526","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y5zwWmPzFrdr3rb06QskU5voU4P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1148,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ltZBPnVQIVRAKMe1aX9Q7YQpdFG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":766}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1956-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
