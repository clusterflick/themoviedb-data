First and second generation Black and Asian immigrants, as well as ex-National Front members, paint a detailed picture of discrimination in 1970s Britain. The film uses lo-fi animation, archive footage and a pulsating soundtrack to compare racial inequality in London to Britain's colonial 'divide and rule' policy, European fascism and the rise of Nazi Germany.","popularity":0.9393,"poster_path":"/qLlixDq1mis8wTitJ4moXKTDx6g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159628,"logo_path":null,"name":"Newsreel Collective","origin_country":""},{"id":159629,"logo_path":null,"name":"Association of Cinematograph Television and Allied Technicians","origin_country":""},{"id":159630,"logo_path":null,"name":"Allen Lane Trust","origin_country":""},{"id":159631,"logo_path":null,"name":"A.C.T.T.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Divide and Rule - Never!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Newsreel No. 8","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1129878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Robinson","original_name":"Tom Robinson","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/6NNXKcYKHjtQnidjJ7QHzS5KjZP.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66c8f1159bb52a3a02a340f4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3210598,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steel Pulse","original_name":"Steel Pulse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6124bd0431644b0073609a44","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3210603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"The Enchanters","original_name":"The Enchanters","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6124bef65346610028cb74c7","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9Q8zb6NHalISmI90pFPPVVOIZPN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.692,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oU7dCzJHuITimjxHnCX7avM42Gi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":778},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qLlixDq1mis8wTitJ4moXKTDx6g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4107,"name":"british empire"},{"id":178959,"name":"reggae music"},{"id":241927,"name":"race relations"},{"id":257456,"name":"anti-racism"},{"id":272694,"name":"east london"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Divide and Rule Never","key":"QIl0X3tuI1o","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-03-24T13:20:09.000Z","id":"6124c0236e938a007e49e924"}]}}}
