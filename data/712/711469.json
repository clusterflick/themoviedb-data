Rarely do Japanese employees stand up against exploitative working conditions, since the social pressure is too high. In his documentary, Tokachi TSUCHIYA follows the case of a moving company sales agent who decides to no longer accept illegal employment contract clauses and a humiliating work environment. Initially being just like an ant among others, he joins a labor union and fights not only for his own rights, but for the rights of all “ants” in Japan’s workforce.","popularity":0.0861,"poster_path":"/6s14PyvjV57dNNl9jV6xksu7IyG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Ant Strikes Back","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Ari jigoku tengoku","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1134761,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tokachi Tsuchiya","original_name":"土屋トカチ","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed58d74528b2e001e6c5877","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12249896","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tuID6Yepe1ie6Kg4tHo6OrTcUk4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":904,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/6s14PyvjV57dNNl9jV6xksu7IyG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Japanese\", \"english_name\"=>\"Japanese\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"ja\", \"native_name\"=>\"Japanese\"}","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"An Ant Strikes Back - trailer","key":"G9MFZbZ3kHA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-10-22T13:49:17.000Z","id":"64ca4e6085b105011cad9d71"}]}}}
