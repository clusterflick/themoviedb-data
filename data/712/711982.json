One night, unexpectedly, a total blackout leaves the city without electricity. People feel paralyzed, their world is dipped in darkness. Matteo is a young electronic music producer big fan of Chemical Brothers and Daft Punk. He’s composing the songs of his new album. In a single moment, he loses all his work on his computer. Crushed by the lack of electricity and ensnared on his habits, Matteo finds an entirely different dimension of himself and everything around him thanks to the encounter with Greta, his neighbor from next door, who’s writing a novel inspired by this emergency.","popularity":0.1578,"poster_path":"/t0tPvXrYVFokWfy1Ws4zvsYQvdh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122038,"logo_path":null,"name":"So What Pictures","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2018-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2664152,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sara Taigher","original_name":"Sara Taigher","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed759ab8ddc340021daba88","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2664154,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Yassmin Yaghmai","original_name":"Yassmin Yaghmai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed759c68ddc340021daba9c","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Character Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2664153,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Intiman","original_name":"Intiman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed759bae4b576001e33cbbf","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1061,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t0tPvXrYVFokWfy1Ws4zvsYQvdh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":708}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2583,"name":"blackout"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2018-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
