Many of his videos are inspired by screenplays for films, folktales and novels. Analyzing these literary and cinematographic passages allows him to exploit the conventions of film narrative: how to tell a story, captivate an audience through a tale, sustain a degree of tension and entertainment, and so on. At the same time, he corrupts the magic of fiction by openly showing us the entrails of everything he records, without worrying about revealing the tricks of the trade. A large part of his filmic oeuvre features a conglomeration of cinematic and literary references which the artist quotes, adapts or interprets. Ben-Ner self-referentially links the great themes and their literary, cinematic and artistic realization.","popularity":0.2612,"poster_path":"/luHJEAR5mJ12QHwd41SUfmtxB8M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134979,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sommer Contemporary Art","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moby Dick","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1345878,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guy Ben Ner","original_name":"Guy Ben Ner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ed664d4c4f552001dbe48aa","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1345878,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guy Ben Ner","original_name":"Guy Ben Ner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed664c621c4ca0020e8d8f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1660,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/luHJEAR5mJ12QHwd41SUfmtxB8M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1107}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":536,"name":"israel"},{"id":208733,"name":"video art"},{"id":250871,"name":"video artist"},{"id":257981,"name":"moby dick"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
