The filmmakers talk to legal experts, activists and law enforcement officials who discuss the inequality within our criminal justice system and who confront the crucial question of how to prevent more violence in this country, including Black on Black deaths.  As the Black Lives Matter movement - and citizens nationwide - question the accountability of our justice system in cases of police violence, When Justice Isn't Just is an essential addition to the ongoing discussion about reform and renewal.","popularity":2.0329,"poster_path":"/vUOibExUnQyih9eyrPx2AN2R0eI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Target Acquired","title":"When Justice Isn't Just","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1355094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Massey","original_name":"David Massey","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659a84315b12400148036380","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":2156,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vUOibExUnQyih9eyrPx2AN2R0eI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1528}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12425,"name":"racism"},{"id":220929,"name":"criminal justice"},{"id":233840,"name":"black lives matter"},{"id":241782,"name":"criminal justice system"},{"id":257456,"name":"anti-racism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"WHEN JUSTICE ISN'T JUST - OFFICIAL TRAILER","key":"FnLy_W3F2Kg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2016-06-17T01:41:40.000Z","id":"5ed6e36321c4ca0021e51fc5"}]}}}
