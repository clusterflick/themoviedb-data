It was occupied by the Soviet army in 1945. One year later, after a short period of cohabitation, 17.000 Japanese and Ainu people who were living in the Kurils and on Sakhalin were deported to the island of Hokkaido. Since that time Japan has been demanding the return of the Kuril Islands. A peace treaty between the two countries still has not been signed.","popularity":0.2048,"poster_path":"/9ifXJuKAomduuEDNRCUxJmzCeUf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134937,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les films du temps scellé","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kunashir","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2662771,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anton Shepshelevich","original_name":"Anton Shepshelevich","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624b51786e0d72004efae94c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2662774,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Foucher","original_name":"David Foucher","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624b659219690c00525fcfda","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1321690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Peltier","original_name":"Nicolas Peltier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619a981735db45008b16d82b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2662772,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Fabien Daguerre","original_name":"Fabien Daguerre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed569c1c4f552001fbf12d4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2687121,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir Kozlov","original_name":"Vladimir Kozlov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/g3m0lpiRajDawt0ZQlhXN1PwT26.jpg","credit_id":"5ef0071a41429100326c5fea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1409539,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gleb Teleshov","original_name":"Gleb Teleshov","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/3ItuGx2vkA69GwHSj32mM5G88Ul.jpg","credit_id":"5f919752d9f4a60039d77890","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2687121,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir Kozlov","original_name":"Vladimir Kozlov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/g3m0lpiRajDawt0ZQlhXN1PwT26.jpg","credit_id":"5f91976e278d8a0037396250","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15684984","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.724,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/9ifXJuKAomduuEDNRCUxJmzCeUf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":543},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/bNxf0Vd4jhCWzzI2IIk7ZSXoyXB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2041,"name":"island"},{"id":233,"name":"japan"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Art Doc Fest","release_date":"2020-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Krakow Film Festival","release_date":"2020-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Art Doc Fest","release_date":"2020-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Novaya Gazeta","release_date":"2022-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"KT","key":"t9VJb9yqZVk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-08-18T12:38:08.000Z","id":"624b54983a48c50098817dcc"}]}}}
