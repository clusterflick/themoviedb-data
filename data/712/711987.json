Cunning, bad faith,  all blows are allowed in what is primarily a fight of words. \"","popularity":0.2787,"poster_path":"/m3zTKWHjFCFl4EVPaXsGb6ZMW1t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82916,"logo_path":null,"name":"Théâtre du Rond-Point","origin_country":""},{"id":90912,"logo_path":"/A7PXRzF4WwrH36x99hfCTMadaCr.png","name":"Pascal Legros Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":135023,"logo_path":null,"name":"Félix Ascot","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Batailles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Arditi","original_name":"Pierre Arditi","popularity":0.5328,"profile_path":"/kLvyrJkfcGUKzn3rHI0SYX5uPwj.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ed75c9afea0d7001e8e0f8d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7693,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"François Berléand","original_name":"François Berléand","popularity":0.9955,"profile_path":"/5TDYSUfCj8vaG5sqJXUU06Cvafa.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ed75c9f1b157d001f59a38a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":125037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tonie Marshall","original_name":"Tonie Marshall","popularity":0.1869,"profile_path":"/urtlFI9YSRQKytvYeFXxCo9Ep55.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5ed75caa1b157d002054feb1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1105715,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emeline Bayart","original_name":"Emeline Bayart","popularity":0.0644,"profile_path":"/gxJf4c4ACWYfKCOb55ViaIKPCay.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5ed75cb4e4b576002036cd3a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83842,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Michel Ribes","original_name":"Jean-Michel Ribes","popularity":0.1501,"profile_path":"/v4U1cvwWjwjsD5k1hfzdMgZJuTs.jpg","credit_id":"5ed75cc8e4b576002036cd60","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1146841,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Czaplinski","original_name":"Patrick Czaplinski","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed75cd6c4f552001fc19635","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Marc Stehlé","original_name":"Jean-Marc Stehlé","popularity":0.1323,"profile_path":"/2VDNVeaIgB5kP4lNtAedDSL8vtq.jpg","credit_id":"5ed75cfe8ddc34001fd9de22","department":"Art","job":"Decorator"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1164952,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Juliette Chanaud","original_name":"Juliette Chanaud","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/74rnYNQvXWTfdTLuhDEgn7Rey0M.jpg","credit_id":"5ed75d17c4f552001dbee094","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83842,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Michel Ribes","original_name":"Jean-Michel Ribes","popularity":0.1501,"profile_path":"/v4U1cvwWjwjsD5k1hfzdMgZJuTs.jpg","credit_id":"66e16c8a000000000022ab16","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49505,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Roland Topor","original_name":"Roland Topor","popularity":0.2294,"profile_path":"/AwrJsLOQcZAb5qXsqOEN55BAjla.jpg","credit_id":"66e16c94000000000022ab19","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/77v4KxzwrgteXVgoZqPzmEEnkdQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/m3zTKWHjFCFl4EVPaXsGb6ZMW1t.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.694,"height":1212,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/9FX3KefWcx9zIrjfSew63gE5DZV.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":841}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4326,"name":"theater play"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Batailles - Pierre Arditi & François Berléand","key":"G138XKzoD4Q","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2009-12-10T17:11:54.000Z","id":"5ed75eaf8ddc340020d91e37"}]}}}
