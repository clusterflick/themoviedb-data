Our goal thereafter focused on collecting the greatest possible number of testimonies related to the history of Spanish anarcho-syndicalism. As part of the celebrations of 100 years of CNT we set up the project, the union decided to fund it and we set off . We travelled 12,000 km visiting three countries relying on the logistical support of CNT and selfless work of their members as well as partners Malicious Films GuerrillART.
