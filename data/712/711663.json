Broadcast live on 28 December 1964, this rare TV musical is one of few to have survived from the 1960s. A tale of Afro-Caribbean immigration, the show is unusual for its time in that it doesn't labour the issues around racial tensions in Britain, but simply celebrates Christmas and family.","popularity":0.3008,"poster_path":"/sg1oEpuSayCcWz6Xy2TNWRdGhgb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1964-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rise and Fall of Nellie Brown","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1408693,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Millie Small","original_name":"Millie Small","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/wvh8EMSMpxfQP6ABGC7J4MwL7JV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5ed636d68ddc340021d91f18","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":975135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisabeth Welch","original_name":"Elisabeth Welch","popularity":0.1341,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ed636c7c4f552001ebef51b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ron Moody","original_name":"Ron Moody","popularity":0.2773,"profile_path":"/xCEPHWkeFrJd7sXpKLJiFA5ibJP.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5ed637211b157d001e55bd9d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":575450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenny Lynch","original_name":"Kenny Lynch","popularity":0.1476,"profile_path":"/mA5UwYnf2fCcGMSfFZV8gJkr430.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5ed6372a528b2e001e6cdc6d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1231166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryan Mosley","original_name":"Bryan Mosley","popularity":0.0726,"profile_path":"/t0LSyouOgD6qD4Ryu9MfiNsNvN3.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6121889aec370c005b8b6d41","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2073500,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Jacobs","original_name":"John Jacobs","popularity":0.0654,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed636bd1b157d001f58239f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2074966,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert Gould","original_name":"Robert Gould","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e45b6928048d92def9897a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sg1oEpuSayCcWz6Xy2TNWRdGhgb.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1073,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wKDjdE5XCvLigD4ey87wKPv5luu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":714}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1964-12-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
