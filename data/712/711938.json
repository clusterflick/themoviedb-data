In this post-apocalyptic scenario, the short film portrays a journey through the search for breaking the silence, thinking about the innumerable processes of silence passed by the characters in the old world. In this sense, the end of the world is also a character, being the personification of a state of mind that permeates the loneliness of the black woman. The short film reveres female power, rescues memories, discusses affection and thinks about paths to be followed.","popularity":0.3807,"poster_path":"/pht8AE3ciuOR9YhoCxCnw9x714r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2019-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Woman at the End of the World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2677508,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tainah Paes","original_name":"Tainah Paes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5fa53907519bbb003e501bf5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2845430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Luiza Apolônio","original_name":"Maria Luiza Apolônio","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5fa5395c34e1520042750caf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2845432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adalício Batista","original_name":"Adalício Batista","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5fa53996211ce5003d7fa094","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2714832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriel Moura","original_name":"Gabriel Moura","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/nEXiwAdURw3IgSrHyxfM6Te0iVj.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5fa539bac68b69003d9fde56","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2664013,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ana do Campo","original_name":"Ana do Campo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed72d9c1b157d001f595b39","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2845428,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sérgio Loureiro","original_name":"Sérgio Loureiro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa538376e3deb0045457da9","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2664013,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ana do Campo","original_name":"Ana do Campo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa53848a579f9003e746ab6","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1274988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raquel Carvalho","original_name":"Raquel Carvalho","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa5389ad11e0e004191fe44","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2845428,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sérgio Loureiro","original_name":"Sérgio Loureiro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa538ac211ce5003b800178","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2845429,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ariel L.
