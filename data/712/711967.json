In this film, the director explains that people who moved from poor countryside formed urban slum, and because they did not have formal education or asset, they worked as day laborers. Residence was one particular problem they faced as they lost their main dwelling area due to redevelopment. They start their day at dawn and work till night. However, these hard-working people do not receive any recognition from the society.","popularity":0.0297,"poster_path":"/f4nwyFQ7Mcs3juNcL8bMveiRpkN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Standing on the Edge of Death","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Urban Poor Standing on the Edge","type":"festival title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Dong-won","original_name":"김동원","popularity":0.0896,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed73cd18ddc34001fd9c3db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f4nwyFQ7Mcs3juNcL8bMveiRpkN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"1991-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
