They depended upon strong social, cultural and spiritual practices passed from generation to generation.  In the last century, rapid and forced changes in the life ways of Alaska Native peoples created many complex, painful scars for Elders who experienced them, and for their children's children. In a landscape as dramatic as its stories, WE BREATHE AGAIN intimately explores the lives of four Alaska Native people, each confronting the impacts of inter-generational trauma and suicide.","popularity":0.0736,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Stories of Four Alaska Native People","title":"We Breathe Again","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3278596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Nagaruk","original_name":"Paul Nagaruk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6170e8301d019100441aa33b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3278598,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keggulluk Polk","original_name":"Keggulluk Polk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6170e843d75bd60042df7024","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3278600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jody Potts","original_name":"Jody Potts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6170e85a176a940042b56f17","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3278601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Tate","original_name":"Eddie Tate","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6170e8606d4c970027290b88","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3278602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marsh Chamberlain","original_name":"Marsh Chamberlain","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6170e8726728a8008cbae008","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8230384","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"We Breathe Again Trailer","key":"yFLpGj_e4oA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-10-10T17:32:22.000Z","id":"6170e8aebf09d100445f8399"}]}}}
