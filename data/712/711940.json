By their words and actions, the dissident Inuit of Povungnituk, Ivujivik and Sugluk express their strong desire to retain their land and their traditions. The filmmakers go into their homes, on the ice and the sea to record first-hand the lives of these northern people.","popularity":0.2173,"poster_path":"/iXVlvx48xOvZ1jP9VUW9C3rMWxF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1983-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Inuktitut","iso_639_1":"iu","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Land, Our Truth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3458735,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Claude Chevalier","original_name":"Claude Chevalier","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff76ac9653f600817efcb0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1340601,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Yves Gendron","original_name":"Yves Gendron","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff76c09f1be700e677b18a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1194581,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Fernand Bélanger","original_name":"Fernand Bélanger","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff76c7c7176d007980532a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3944253,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"William McClelland","original_name":"William McClelland","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff76ba9653f6007c1d444d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1357417,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jean Dansereau","original_name":"Jean Dansereau","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff768c9f1be7008ebdb135","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1194587,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hans Peter Strobl","original_name":"Hans Peter Strobl","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff76d19f1be700e677b192","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1618212,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maurice Bulbulian","original_name":"Maurice Bulbulian","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed7307bc4f552001ebfd713","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1340600,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Roger Rochat","original_name":"Roger Rochat","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679816ec372cb20cf8237968","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1389438,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Martin Leclerc","original_name":"Martin Leclerc","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6798235dba4f941f448f1a59","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1177247,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jacques Leduc","original_name":"Jacques Leduc","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":"/loS8GxqZmGvpB8JXyiOx45pSlCe.jpg","credit_id":"6798236b16f0d960df23cc0a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0126259","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hZDElf4G1LFKnztlcB03t5j2IEk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1333}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":924,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iXVlvx48xOvZ1jP9VUW9C3rMWxF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":616}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6086,"name":"government"},{"id":1551,"name":"indigenous"},{"id":3355,"name":"inuit"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
