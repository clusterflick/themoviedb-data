Transitive enharmonics of things touching in middair, an air which is Timeâ€”not an actual intersection, but with a consequence as powerful as predestination, a momentary fulfillment, a trail beyond mere pattern, like a streak of truth alive and uncontained, like something that runs through infinity slowing to leave condensation, sonority, a temperature. Lines crossing lines. Not there. There. Invisibilities smudging. Gesture and impression, optic suggestions, agents on and in the mind. Each with vibrations, dollops, whispers, throbs, particles and waves. A finger of pigment brushing a lip of language exchanging carriage supports, liquidities, fire. Moire of meanings. Micro settings in the heart. The time it takes. The very least one can say is to say The Extravagant Shadows is a major work. Humanly essential, adventurous and necessary.","popularity":0.1521,"poster_path":"/couxqRWyzFhvWvzc5wXh3kJpJO5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":175,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Extravagant Shadows","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":1076451,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Gatten","original_name":"David Gatten","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/sALyIeLWitHtT21x3ql47oYar7r.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c23c3a368484e1a9511","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11463528","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/llh7bxrS9gc7DQ2FQM0FW3bcJRE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oHYj788enJgZfPloUEU88pr9wCO.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/couxqRWyzFhvWvzc5wXh3kJpJO5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":213891,"name":"abstract"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB","release_date":"2012-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
