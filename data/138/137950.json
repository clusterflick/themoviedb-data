This DVD was filmed at Irvine Meadows, California on 12 June 1982. The show was part of the delayed continuation of the \"Diary of a Madman\" tour following the tragic death of Randy Rhoads in March 1982 in a flying accident earlier on the tour. The show features guitarist Brad Gillis who was brought in to replace Randy Rhoads. The concert is a perfect snapshot of Ozzy's live performances in the 80s with dramatic staging and masses of energy with a set list based around his first 2 solo albums and a few Black Sabbath classics. Ozzy has always been one of heavy metal's great frontmen and, despite the difficult circumstances, this show captures him at his absolute best.","popularity":0.4274,"poster_path":"/2rvPFCsGz9sD6t9WJGAjjyoLWCu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Recorded at Live The Ritz, New York, USA - 26 & 27 September 1982.","title":"Ozzy Osbourne: Speak of the Devil","video":true,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ozzy Osbourne","original_name":"Ozzy Osbourne","popularity":0.3847,"profile_path":"/e6xwFbTYKA0JJmkZZmvUv08hAqL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Vocals","credit_id":"52fe4c3cc3a368484e1ae0c7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1332098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brad Gillis","original_name":"Brad Gillis","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/5oAIhawaf2nnuHPPaeJsHyb0bVf.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Guitars","credit_id":"53a37fca0e0a2667d5000223","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1332099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudy Sarzo","original_name":"Rudy Sarzo","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/adeVzvt68taCps7cMMbqGZ02sJq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bass","credit_id":"53a37fde0e0a2667c9000242","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1320881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tommy Aldridge","original_name":"Tommy Aldridge","popularity":0.0372,"profile_path":"/gJQzyZtFPtWdAKyzHKboAWGTWhV.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Drums","credit_id":"5b24367c92514139470015db","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":984,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8hr7zzFUS87x5Jh0KQlqyUEzFMH.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":656},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2rvPFCsGz9sD6t9WJGAjjyoLWCu.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":578,"name":"rock 'n' roll"},{"id":5540,"name":"heavy metal"},{"id":18002,"name":"hard rock"},{"id":163133,"name":"singer-songwriter"},{"id":336928,"name":"english musician"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
