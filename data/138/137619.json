Umbracle is made up of fragments (some are archive footage) that resound rather than progress by unusual links, with dejá vu scenes that promise us more but remain tensely unfinished. Jonathan Rosembaun said: “few directors since Resnais have played so ruthlessly with the unconscious narrative expectations to bug us”. Learning from the feeling of strangeness caused by Rossellini as he threw well known actors into savage scenery in southern Europe.  Portabella makes Christopher Lee wander around a dream-like Barcelona. Without a doubt Portabella’s most structurally complex and most profoundly political film, that is ferociously poetic.","popularity":0.4459,"poster_path":"/zMAl2Rxz0k77Idn7dBFWis30GAY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37802,"logo_path":"/qcYcBGZFIzRR3rvXkYSU4xDlftZ.png","name":"Films 59","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Umbracle","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Lee","original_name":"Christopher Lee","popularity":2.2688,"profile_path":"/4zPu5YaRPbhrcp9aVjXQDjpfwPC.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Man","credit_id":"52fe4c36c3a368484e1ace97","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":35261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeannine Mestre","original_name":"Jeannine Mestre","popularity":0.1138,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"The Woman","credit_id":"52fe4c36c3a368484e1ace9b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1694538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miguel Bilbatúa","original_name":"Miguel Bilbatúa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"58011a009251411eb2000201","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932166,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Román Gubern","original_name":"Román Gubern","popularity":0.095,"profile_path":"/wyfmM3EmVqGZ0wqRFEgRdXqV1Ll.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"58011a089251411ea30001fa","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1459714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joan Enric Lahosa","original_name":"Joan Enric Lahosa","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"58011a10c3a36834350001fa","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1694539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joan Miró","original_name":"Joan Miró","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"58011a349251411eb200020d","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pere Portabella","original_name":"Pere Portabella","popularity":0.1089,"profile_path":"/vS6B7Ug4RaZjYEWm7PX645Y7n84.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c36c3a368484e1ace81","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1107459,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carles Santos","original_name":"Carles Santos","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c36c3a368484e1ace93","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pere Portabella","original_name":"Pere Portabella","popularity":0.1089,"profile_path":"/vS6B7Ug4RaZjYEWm7PX645Y7n84.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c36c3a368484e1ace87","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1107473,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joan Brossa","original_name":"Joan Brossa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c36c3a368484e1ace8d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1086384,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Teresa Alcocer","original_name":"Teresa Alcocer","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58011abd9251411ea0000255","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1107474,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Manuel Esteban Marquilles","original_name":"Manuel Esteban Marquilles","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58011ab0c3a3683438000203","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0066499","wikidata_id":"Q7881378","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1687,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fdZn9NsHinAktZRlFbd84yJN9l7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1911,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/zMAl2Rxz0k77Idn7dBFWis30GAY.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1274},{"aspect_ratio":0.718,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/1l7L3Liq3A4asxem4HjZfj0sv3d.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1292},{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1911,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/4kBX79Rnn9OMCajG36p53PTvU9r.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1356}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
