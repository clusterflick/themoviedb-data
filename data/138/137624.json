The film records the removal of furniture and objects from the building, leaving visitors able to move freely amongst its empty spaces and a silence charged with feeling and resonance and the take from the experience whatever they demand from it - thus making poet Federico García Lorca's emotive and historic absence even more powerful, evident and heartfelt.","popularity":0.1648,"poster_path":"/nVsPjEMItqWbBmCjQkyUO9b1nNK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37802,"logo_path":"/qcYcBGZFIzRR3rvXkYSU4xDlftZ.png","name":"Films
