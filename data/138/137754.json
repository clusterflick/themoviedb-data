It was released in the United Kingdom on October 15, 2007 and in the United States a day later as a two-Compact Disc audio set and a DVD, then released in February 2008 as a triple vinyl set. The performance was filmed by Blue Leach the same director of Depeche Mode DVD \"Touring the Angel: Live in Milan\".  R.E.M. Live features rare performances of \"I Took Your Name\" from 1994's Monster and \"Ascent of Man\" from Around The Sun as well as the previously unreleased \"I'm Gonna DJ.\" A studio version of that song would later appear on the band's 2008 effort, Accelerate.
