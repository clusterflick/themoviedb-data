While Kubelka’s radical and pioneering body of films is a highly condensed work of about an hour, focusing on the essence of cinema, his legendary lectures often unfold over many hours. These lectures on “what is cinema” and “cooking as an art form” are frequently illuminated by presentation of archaeological artefacts from Kubelka’s eclectic collection. He considers his ongoing collecting to be an expanded film practice which explores the evolution of humanity.  Martina Kudláček has carefully woven an open-ended portrait which goes beyond the biographical to reveal fresh insights into the phenomenon of film.","popularity":0.0423,"poster_path":"/eI92Ov05kc91v6vpyUZWSYMUmfH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2012-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":230,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fragments of Kubelka","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1046110,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Kubelka","original_name":"Peter Kubelka","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/8p1CLqCFL40z8vnyTH8YZ8L346H.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b6c487c925141404f1092dc","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":995584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martina Kudlácek","original_name":"Martina Kudlácek","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c23c3a368484e1a9543","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3087878","wikidata_id":"Q55119994","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1417,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eI92Ov05kc91v6vpyUZWSYMUmfH.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ugBSLfVu8pXkbQy5MH1edQpJ4u3.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/v7uwtJ5xxRkphJ6aDj2UIB8Bmk2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
