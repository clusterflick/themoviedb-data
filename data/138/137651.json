Lured by blue skies, sunshine, palm trees, and the promise of a rich social life, they bought their way to paradise for just a $1,500 down payment. Now, as an aging community faces its own mortality, paradise has begun to exact a higher price. Through the experiences of six longtime residents, 'Kings Point' captures both the allure and the darker complexities of living in a world where 'nobody gets too close.' Poignant, funny and dark, 'Kings Point' is a deeply empathetic portrait of the last act of the American Dream.","popularity":0.1055,"poster_path":"/v3bcIpIRyUqWhzC8yiCvRTS8xdJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A tale of love, loss and self-preservation.","title":"Kings Point","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1000817,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sari Gilman","original_name":"Sari Gilman","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c37c3a368484e1ad105","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1000817,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sari Gilman","original_name":"Sari Gilman","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a90be4b3316b00ed4fa6fe","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1621334,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Todd Wider","original_name":"Todd Wider","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a90bedaaec71007b2edd86","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1049690,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Susannah Ludwig","original_name":"Susannah Ludwig","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a90bd515a4a100a701afa6","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1621333,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jedd Wider","original_name":"Jedd Wider","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b7170b80e0a267ee5182f25","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2109153","wikidata_id":"Q6413002","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kpl5BXy0rlcrQzvHvckCNWoadhx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yHHfD3UaS7VVYdur5G4UaxPxGSM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1763,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/v3bcIpIRyUqWhzC8yiCvRTS8xdJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1175},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":2180,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gblcuEG7VKTZ2htVnOZ6UhIEJIh.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1544},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zqznh6Q6IuQwZXd9QXJNIKiajkA.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
