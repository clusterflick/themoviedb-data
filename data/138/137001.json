Feel the breeze in your hair, and the world crumbling through your fingers.","popularity":0.0556,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Circle in the Sand","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1096778,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Robinson","original_name":"Michael Robinson","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":"/lmUfAqUXvjgncsd4DmsyOhqp70S.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c23c3a368484e1a94a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
