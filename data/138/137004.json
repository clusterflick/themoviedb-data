A legend of the avant-garde theater, Foreman is also a passionate film fan, whose taste ranges from American avant-garde to Manoel de Oliveira. ONCE EVERY DAY marks his first foray into feature filmmaking in 35 years. Highly visual, complexly edited and without a traditional narrative, the film zeroes in on a group of 25 people acting out a series of semi-ritualistic behavior patterns. But their eccentric impulses are aborted in unpredictable ways with each attempt at action or development. According to the director, “The film slowly evolves a time-mosaic of reformatted consciousness.” Longtime admirers of Foreman’s work will see an intriguing adaptation of his unique theatrical style to the cinema. And for everyone else: Welcome to the extraordinary world  of Richard Foreman.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/ksXqWgaZD1AawUBR8EEF6548Bb5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Once Every Day","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1155680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dana Block","original_name":"Dana Block","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c23c3a368484e1a952b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1155681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abby Marianetti","original_name":"Abby Marianetti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c23c3a368484e1a952f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106587,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Foreman","original_name":"Richard Foreman","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c23c3a368484e1a9521","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106587,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Foreman","original_name":"Richard Foreman","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c23c3a368484e1a9527","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2729070","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ksXqWgaZD1AawUBR8EEF6548Bb5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
