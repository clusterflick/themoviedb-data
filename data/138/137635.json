Portabella was not interested in simply filming a testimonial documentary. However, he said he would do the film if after the exhibit Joan Miró himself, with the help of the cleaning staff erased his own painting. Joan Miró accepted the idea without a doubt. The complicity between the film maker and the painter is evident in the filming.","popularity":0.1265,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":195504,"logo_path":null,"name":"Colegio de Arquitectos de Cataluña","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miró, l’altre","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Miró, otro","type":"Castilian Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1694539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joan Miró","original_name":"Joan Miró","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"640ccee5a6c10400790450e6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pere Portabella","original_name":"Pere Portabella","popularity":0.1089,"profile_path":"/vS6B7Ug4RaZjYEWm7PX645Y7n84.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c36c3a368484e1ad029","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1107459,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carles Santos","original_name":"Carles Santos","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c36c3a368484e1ad02f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1086384,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Teresa Alcocer","original_name":"Teresa Alcocer","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c36c3a368484e1ad03b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2003124,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"José Pedro Villanueva","original_name":"José Pedro Villanueva","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640cceb9323eba010b903391","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100729,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anne Settimó","original_name":"Anne Settimó","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640cced02a09bc00f72ca73c","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pere Portabella","original_name":"Pere Portabella","popularity":0.1089,"profile_path":"/vS6B7Ug4RaZjYEWm7PX645Y7n84.jpg","credit_id":"640cce6801432500c0b9301e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1107474,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Manuel Esteban Marquilles","original_name":"Manuel Esteban Marquilles","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640cce931ac29200cd953c28","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0158000","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
