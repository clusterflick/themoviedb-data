After a very good response, MTV Asia commissioned his company to produce a short film on the back of it. “As I was creating concepts drawings,” explains Ben Hibon, “MTV Asia was starting to plan their annual Music Awards. They then came up with the idea of ‘launching’ our project by using it to brand the show; posters, banners, trophy design and intro/bumper animations. So the brief changed from ‘short film’ to ‘branding package’ for the MTV Awards show.” It formed into a seven-minute prologue / intro animation to the world of ‘Codehunters’, an on-going MTV/BLINKINK project launched around the MTV Asia Awards 2006 in Bangkok.","popularity":0.0629,"poster_path":"/jocu3uoq8XhkaYYW4aAcaDRD3om.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135700,"logo_path":"/5s0oBB2xIxSzpSV7Ft9B8Bs3yeH.png","name":"Axis Animation","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"4 hunters against a demon-infested world","title":"Codehunters","video":false,"vote_average":8.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","title":"Vanatorii de coduri","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Hibon","original_name":"Ben Hibon","popularity":0.1118,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621798bd3d4d96001a2f2de6","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2819294,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bart Yates","original_name":"Bart Yates","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6217985bafa1b0006cc11392","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1410240,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joris de Man","original_name":"Joris de Man","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621798998d2f8d001bf83916","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3442003,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Imke Ferhmann","original_name":"Imke Ferhmann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621799413a9937001a1ff1a9","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441997,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charmaine Choo","original_name":"Charmaine Choo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6217987cafa1b0006cc113f5","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3441999,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Hillman","original_name":"Mark Hillman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621798cacb80280065f9d6fa","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3442001,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matt Craigie","original_name":"Matt Craigie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62179909a6d931006b283526","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2019527,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Andrew Proctor","original_name":"Andrew Proctor","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6217997cafa1b0004562d449","department":"Visual Effects","job":"CG Animator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1410240,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joris de Man","original_name":"Joris de Man","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6217989fa88587004214f01a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Hibon","original_name":"Ben Hibon","popularity":0.1118,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62179916a88587001bebe6fa","department":"Art","job":"Storyboard Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Hibon","original_name":"Ben Hibon","popularity":0.1118,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a38c3a36847f81c1f19","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Hibon","original_name":"Ben Hibon","popularity":0.1118,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a38c3a36847f81c1f1f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1596726","wikidata_id":"Q21161299","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":844,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AqaAFqthNrbM6l1T55kJb9LZev1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1400,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jocu3uoq8XhkaYYW4aAcaDRD3om.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
