With the help of Egodoki, Frau PC has the Ludovico Technique applied on him, and beside the broken Alex she has Rex Madison, the protagonist of American Psycho brought in, with handcuffs on. The self-assured gigolo breaks down at the appearance of Maggie, his first love, and it is he who wins the confessional show led by Mrs Cardinal Paula Aquarius, which incurs pardon to be given. Rex, freed from his shackles, shoots the majority of those present, rapes PC and leaves together with Alex by helicopter. The show continues on the moon.","popularity":0.2503,"poster_path":"/zuJVMb1YAOl36kZzXaJU0sTe6JI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2001-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A bőrödre megy a játék!","title":"Nexxt","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":123943,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorottya Udvaros","original_name":"Dorottya Udvaros","popularity":0.1714,"profile_path":"/xL5wyYlENb4UeXGZy4QjBhC23EF.jpg","cast_id":1006,"character":"Frau Plastic Chicken","credit_id":"52fe4a38c3a36847f81c1b31","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoltán Mucsi","original_name":"Zoltán Mucsi","popularity":0.1033,"profile_path":"/i2PES4obtTwMC95PN2396pehnvO.jpg","cast_id":1007,"character":"Little Alex","credit_id":"52fe4a38c3a36847f81c1b35","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1036393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viktor Bodó","original_name":"Viktor Bodó","popularity":0.0847,"profile_path":"/o82TEWgY8f6a0pKU3NrJvG7KISk.jpg","cast_id":1008,"character":"Rex Madison","credit_id":"52fe4a38c3a36847f81c1b39","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1036394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gergely Bánki","original_name":"Gergely Bánki","popularity":0.1429,"profile_path":"/3xCRQIIV2sSixsNpoZR2lWsR3ja.jpg","cast_id":1009,"character":"Sony Double Junior","credit_id":"52fe4a38c3a36847f81c1b3d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sándor Terhes","original_name":"Sándor Terhes","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/bb6l9d88ET1X9MpPnK1ePsElr3Z.jpg","cast_id":1010,"character":"Homeless man / Ego Doctor","credit_id":"52fe4a38c3a36847f81c1b41","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sándor Csányi","original_name":"Sándor Csányi","popularity":0.0905,"profile_path":"/2hsqGcSr1zumLf7ghCa7hJhrd1I.jpg","cast_id":1011,"character":"Balfék / T.
