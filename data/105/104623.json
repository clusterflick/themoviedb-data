In explicit abattoir photos and much symbolism, Matsui tells about the struggles of ethnic Koreans in Japan. A butcher's love affair and his relationship with the animals he kills frame the story.","popularity":0.3433,"poster_path":"/d5Fif6dFTTm9wuuB15AzppD4YWZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43637,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yokubô
