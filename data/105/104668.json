Four prisoners are about to be released after serving 20 years as political detainees. About to return to society, they grapple with complications that have developed in their absence: new towns, new ideologies but most of all, new family dynamics. Questions arise as to what extent their political dissidence was worth their separations from families and the losses their loved ones have endured. While some stand fast to their choices, others look to turn a new page...  Made in 2009, the film is yet to be released in Syria, despite being a production ostensibly supported by the regime. The film, while reflecting a short era of reconciliation and reduced censorship attempted by Bashar Al Assad, remains highly relevant today for its treatments of forced loyalty signatures, arbitrary judgements, and systematic torture.","popularity":0.1222,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Long Night","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1410414,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Khaled Taja","original_name":"Khaled Taja","popularity":0.1844,"profile_path":"/9xXnxoEcVbSFJjZONbOw0CnXTO3.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Kareem","credit_id":"54ad7973c3a368536d000361","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1260464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amal Arafa","original_name":"أمل عرفة","popularity":0.4407,"profile_path":"/cfd1sNg49Q663CQTB5XvhfgUGka.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Orobah","credit_id":"54ad798392514132a800027f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1410415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Najah Safkouni","original_name":"Najah Safkouni","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":"/bbaXlhmg7lxCJcgXICpcV0dCxDn.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Hasan","credit_id":"54ad799692514145e600001a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1808074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bassel Khayyat","original_name":"Bassel Khayyat","popularity":0.7725,"profile_path":"/3e5iMDJTQdzy4tyCyRulPEAY0Ml.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"64f96d645f2b8d011b50811e","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1410413,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Raouf Zaza","original_name":"Raouf Zaza","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54ad795992514147e0000004","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1260323,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Haitham Hakki","original_name":"Haitham Hakki","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54ad78bd9251412d93000024","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1410411,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mohamed Maghraoui","original_name":"Mohamed Maghraoui","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54ad793ec3a368536d000352","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1260323,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Haitham Hakki","original_name":"Haitham Hakki","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54ad78d7c3a36837d300001b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1259103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hatem Ali","original_name":"حاتم علي","popularity":0.2503,"profile_path":"/2c8DHcXnalS4hPJLPxCIXQqUZNR.jpg","credit_id":"54ad787c9251410c59000053","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1556046","wikidata_id":"Q12192094","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
