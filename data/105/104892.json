Matriarch Iree has given birth to 13 children, but only two have left to seek better lives in Ohio while the rest have married and started their own impoverished families near home. Uneducated and unskilled, all are unemployed, and domestic violence and alcoholism pose serious problems. The filmmakers explore the family's relationships through interviews and footage of their daily lives.","popularity":0.3954,"poster_path":"/k7Iz3jZMD3Ia32hdp6K9Iu9XbRj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42136,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moxie Firecracker Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"American Hollow","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"America Undercover : American Hollow","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2830104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bascum Bowling","original_name":"Bascum Bowling","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1004,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f95e12638e5100037dcd30e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2830105,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clint Bowling","original_name":"Clint Bowling","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1005,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f95e132a6725400390e58d8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2830106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edgar Bowling","original_name":"Edgar Bowling","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1006,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f95e13c965220003a43fed5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2830108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iree Bowling","original_name":"Iree Bowling","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1007,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f95e145965220003a43feee","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2830109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samantha Bowling","original_name":"Samantha Bowling","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1008,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f95e1562fe2fa003aaed5ff","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1037308,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rory Kennedy","original_name":"Rory Kennedy","popularity":0.1159,"profile_path":"/e7Sy1VCnQq5dFEozkTbSXO8U3uU.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4a3fc3a36847f81c34db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69171,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bill Frisell","original_name":"Bill Frisell","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664bcc819cae26b47ef70d97","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1238136,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sheila Nevins","original_name":"Sheila Nevins","popularity":0.0954,"profile_path":"/a9QK5bZlNB0zx2RTROOixTA3o5d.jpg","credit_id":"5f95e0f7965220003843fb6e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1246235,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jacqueline Glover","original_name":"Jacqueline Glover","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f95e0e2c616ac00355dd59c","department":"Production","job":"Supervising Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2830101,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Bailey","original_name":"Mark Bailey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f95e115b7b69d0036a8e914","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0181287","wikidata_id":"Q36492633","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fsAkKzVzyK7jayXz6rCikILN6Qa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/k7Iz3jZMD3Ia32hdp6K9Iu9XbRj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3291,"name":"kentucky"},{"id":7464,"name":"alcoholism"},{"id":8796,"name":"appalachia"},{"id":11925,"name":"domestic violence"},{"id":12987,"name":"poverty"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1999-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"American Hollow","key":"eBA_zLnuWc0","published_at":"2008-09-04T19:57:11.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5ade3c2d0e0a264ba6004536"}]}}}
