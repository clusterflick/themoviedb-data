During the dry season, lions and scientists set up camp at one of the Zambezi Valley's rare waterholes. Elephants, hyenas and buffalo also come there to quench their thirst. The fight for survival begins: hunting and being hunted is the eternal law of Africa's wildlife. The lions have now become accustomed to the human observers, who are able to take spectacular pictures from close proximity. The couple films the pack at night with an infrared camera, and a cub that is only a few hours old observes them with a hidden camera. They capture images that have never been seen before.","popularity":0.4062,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7521,"logo_path":"/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png","name":"National Geographic","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Trail of Lions","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346431,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lynne Richardson","original_name":"Lynne Richardson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64bf7dde05822400cd27e0ce","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4178970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Richardson","original_name":"Phil Richardson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64bf7df66ee3d70124a93646","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2043,"name":"lion"},{"id":9893,"name":"lioness"},{"id":18330,"name":"nature"},{"id":221355,"name":"nature documentary"},{"id":299555,"name":"lions"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
