Trained by his father, Marv, a former pro football player and a strength and conditioning guru, the young Marinovich was meticulously engineered and nurtured into a star quarterback.

He was dubbed \"Robo QB,\" and his performance initially lived up to the name as he set passing records in high school, vied for the Heisman while at USC and ultimately was selected in the first round of the 1991 NFL draft by his hometown Los Angeles Raiders. But two years later, he was out of the NFL, a full-blown drug addict in search of a life beyond football. \"The Marinovich Project\" tells the unvarnished story of Todd's unique ascent to stardom, the dark descent that followed and the complicated father-son bond throughout, ultimately answering the question \"What went wrong with Todd Marinovich?\"","popularity":0.3093,"poster_path":"/p2dqUXEspi4EBtUd2ljvlG4YJNi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17037,"logo_path":"/w9le4FUeXVlKLfnlkuk1djRrena.png","name":"ESPN","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Life doesn't follow the playbook","title":"The Marinovich Project","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3190938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcus Allen","original_name":"Marcus Allen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"611003144a52f80026e118a5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3190940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elliott Almond","original_name":"Elliott Almond","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61100329f04d01001f918bc2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":938191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stan Brock","original_name":"Stan Brock","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4a37c3a36847f81c16e9","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":959698,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Dorsey","original_name":"John Dorsey","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a37c3a36847f81c16d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1116354,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Stephan","original_name":"Andrew Stephan","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"611003708c44b900493eaf22","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2123325","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7Acs3aEhtqCwAzH6a1OOlhVOCVd.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2133},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/h5TasIyGxFzPSVUlyGyZ14FmG0r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1438,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/p2dqUXEspi4EBtUd2ljvlG4YJNi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":958}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":579,"name":"american football"},{"id":159290,"name":"sports documentary"},{"id":240119,"name":"father son relationship"},{"id":313356,"name":"american football player"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Marinovich Project Trailer","key":"YtNS9ivmZbs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-03-17T19:54:10.000Z","id":"65041355e0ca7f012eba5cba"}]}}}
