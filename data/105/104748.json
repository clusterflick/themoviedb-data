Soon after, one of them dies, and the wife of the other dies in childbirth. The children grow up in different towns, without ever knowing of the betrothal, but the power of the vow leads them to meet each other when they are marriageable. The young woman, Leah, is promised to another man, but Channon, the son of the father who died, is a practitioner of mysticism, and seeks to win his bride through sorcery.","popularity":0.8663,"poster_path":"/1nTRmV88wvdahTYUf6DxnONJcrc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94429,"logo_path":null,"name":"Warszawskie Biuro Kinematograficzne Feniks","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1937-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Yiddish","iso_639_1":"yi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dybbuk","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Between Two Worlds","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","title":"Le Dibbouk","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Il Dibbuk, ovvero tra due mondi","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Dybuk","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Der Dibuk","type":"Yiddish title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Avrom Morewski","original_name":"Avrom Morewski","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1001,"character":"Rabbi Ezeriel ben Hodos (as Abram Morewski)","credit_id":"59aa7ca1925141072f00cf55","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1880911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ajzyk Samberg","original_name":"Ajzyk Samberg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1002,"character":"Meszulach","credit_id":"59aa7ca6c3a3682bf000ba1b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1348021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mojzesz Lipman","original_name":"Mojzesz Lipman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"Sender Brynicer ben Henie","credit_id":"59aa7caec3a3682c4800bded","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1880912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lili Liliana","original_name":"Lili Liliana","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1004,"character":"Lea","credit_id":"59aa7cda925141076500d151","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1183897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leon Liebgold","original_name":"Leon Liebgold","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1005,"character":"Chanan ben Nisan","credit_id":"59aa7ce3925141077e00cdbf","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1361917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dina Halpern","original_name":"Dina Halpern","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1020,"character":"Aunt Frade","credit_id":"5fbb5253ca4f670042750f9b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1183898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Bozyk","original_name":"Max Bozyk","popularity":0.0817,"profile_path":"/eXZXkLOJranFFFCqqU2uLKN2uYy.jpg","cast_id":1021,"character":"Nute (as Maks Bozyk)","credit_id":"5fbb525d0816c7003f8e9329","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2866748,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"M.
