During their tour, which began with an old motorcycle to continue after hitchhiking, they witnessed the harsh living conditions of the population of the countries they travelled. Guevara, soon to be known as Che, recorded his impressions in a diary. In 2002, the Brazilian director Walter Salles began shooting a film about that odyssey, \"The Motorcycle Diaries\". This documentary follows the making of that movie in detail, incorporating interviews with various participants.","popularity":0.3514,"poster_path":"/tVDBN9ybhKF2DvxXXXZ8uRQnhkk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34401,"logo_path":null,"name":"Surf Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":255788,"logo_path":null,"name":"G.M.E.
