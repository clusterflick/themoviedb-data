Phelps devises a plan to play Turek off against a rival, Colonel Borodin. Phelps and Meredyth pose as a pair of defecting U.S. scientists, who supposedly have developed an alternative drug to the one that Turek is working on. The IMF's scheme calls for Turek to try to kill Borodin, which will result in a trial where Turek will be discredited. But the complicated plan goes awry and the episode ends with Phelps under fire by guards.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/8LZwFRc6V33kKnSuwnKumbNHjtt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mission: Impossible - The Controllers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Graves","original_name":"Peter Graves","popularity":3.7189,"profile_path":"/bK7Wf7qmKqixhKqzmBX3gNtzFcS.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jim Phelps","credit_id":"683775df3a7f0b5781838e98","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Morris","original_name":"Greg Morris","popularity":1.9544,"profile_path":"/l4pyAMumC6p1V4aqxBra7PWlTvN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Barney Collier","credit_id":"683775f4cd1c8829aa730db9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Lupus","original_name":"Peter Lupus","popularity":1.4933,"profile_path":"/6GxndAwamcoQJqpK5MwYdiYj5be.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Willy Armitage","credit_id":"683775fd0a4ecab0d6839105","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonard Nimoy","original_name":"Leonard Nimoy","popularity":5.1019,"profile_path":"/eKhw3oK8ak5LDB29X9zQDLIqRhw.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Paris","credit_id":"683776075b3914339e4154b2","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1032558,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Krasny","original_name":"Paul Krasny","popularity":2.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6837761fd6983cd21641534b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1216997,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Laurence Heath","original_name":"Laurence Heath","popularity":1.5175,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68377627079a42e287038506","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8LZwFRc6V33kKnSuwnKumbNHjtt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1969-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
