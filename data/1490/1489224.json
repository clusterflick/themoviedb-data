This harrowing attack, carried out by a lone gunman affiliated with ISIS, resulted in the deaths of 38 people, including 30 British tourists, making it the deadliest terror attack on Britons abroad since the 2005 London bombings.  The 90-minute film, produced by Yeti Television in association with Sphere Abacus, features firsthand testimonies from survivors who revisit the traumatic events of that day. Through their narratives, the documentary delves into the immediate chaos, the instinctual fight-or-flight responses, and the profound aftermath experienced by those who lived through the ordeal. It also highlights stories of courage, resilience, and the enduring impact of trauma on individuals and communities.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/rEcnJTDphQImlqiC0GiedqcW1Sb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":217117,"logo_path":"/ul8xG9n2POsvU1W4VrZtVLysSHR.png","name":"Yeti Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A moment-by-moment account of survival, courage, and resilience.","title":"Surviving the Tunisia Beach Attack","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5469191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharon simes","original_name":"Sharon simes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Survivor and breast cancer fighter","credit_id":"68377cfc27de3ffb8e0561de","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5469194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allen Pembroke","original_name":"Allen Pembroke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"NHS volunteer who saved a fellow tourist","credit_id":"68377d20fca5da67032b829c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5469195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cheryl Mellor","original_name":"Cheryl Mellor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Survivor rescued during the attack","credit_id":"68377d300c728a9ee2839005","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5469199,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Krystal Simes","original_name":"Krystal Simes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Daughter of Sharon Simes","credit_id":"68377d4b0c728a9ee2839010","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36581785","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1536,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rEcnJTDphQImlqiC0GiedqcW1Sb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1024}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
