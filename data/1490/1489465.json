But fitting Arngrim into the finished product becomes an exercise in futility as Hughes shoots increasingly absurd (and gory) scenes with Arngrim that don't have much to do with the original plot. Featuring extensive interviews with the cast and vivid film clips, \"Hush...Hush, Nellie Oleson!\" is a love letter to low-budget filmmakers and the former child stars who enable them.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/l91DtIBgpIZlyp6MeLGRFdW94Ae.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":263726,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lucky Charm Studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hush...Hush, Nellie Oleson!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1227127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alison Arngrim","original_name":"Alison Arngrim","popularity":1.3024,"profile_path":"/sQKNkmdycJSRoy43NnmnYlnr0PI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"self","credit_id":"68382ba45b3914339e415742","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Stuart","original_name":"Jason Stuart","popularity":1.8764,"profile_path":"/sGRwNUJ1LRjcRjIz7rlfG6ekNSJ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"self","credit_id":"68382bd786aa54c7c0a87dba","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2273249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Marshall","original_name":"Betty Marshall","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"self","credit_id":"68382bffa4f5e75043b6e65c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4880342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernest Rhoads","original_name":"Ernest Rhoads","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"self","credit_id":"68382c0f8121cf5b6f73113f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2826009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer True","original_name":"Jennifer True","popularity":0.1886,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"self","credit_id":"68382c295f647053e705637f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1678295,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kelly Hughes","original_name":"Kelly Hughes","popularity":0.201,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68382bb6f6e032a5472b8521","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29733608","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kiqed0f01HXn3T1SFOOP4WGH8oQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v5kcSXfqGdOhQnGnCzTipRuTOVB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1499,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l91DtIBgpIZlyp6MeLGRFdW94Ae.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"The Holly Weird Film Festival","release_date":"2019-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
