The location was a natural for the color camera, and the film showcases Miami Beach, St. Augustine, the Bok Garden Singing Tower, and Marineland. The famous flowers of the title make their appearance in the last couple of minutes of the film. While very pretty to look at, the film does feature the genre’s typical white male point-of-view narration that can strike modern audiences as naïve, pretentious, and condescending.\"\r — Anthony L’Abbate","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1940-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Florida, Land of Flowers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1940-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
