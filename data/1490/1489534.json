This film traces the rise and fall of VHS, from its cultural dominance in living rooms and rental stores to the quiet forces that led to its demise. Through curated footage and archival emotion, we explore the love people had for the format, how it shaped a generation’s connection to movies and TV, and why it ultimately faded into memory. Each entry in the series captures a different era of media history—celebrating the formats we once cherished and the moments we recorded, rewound, and eventually left behind.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/i7T6PPjdNcHo3nXCAaiq6IMGT1m.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-30","revenue":1000,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Please Be Kind, Rewind.","title":"Playback: The Rewind Era","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5470540,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eli Martiska","original_name":"Eli Martiska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68385a4b943458cb8db6c6c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5470540,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eli Martiska","original_name":"Eli Martiska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68385a623a7f0b5781839163","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5470546,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Internet Archive","original_name":"Internet Archive","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68385a921ce59bcc97b6c963","department":"Editing","job":"Archival Footage Research"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1b2vJfXwSGIGtR975RTB6PAT1WK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oMDeWeI20lOg2HK4GDMQwI08mag.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i7T6PPjdNcHo3nXCAaiq6IMGT1m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
