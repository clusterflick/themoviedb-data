Full Stop-Motion Movie","overview":"This is a project which took me three years to complete. It is an epic sci-fi adventure following LEGO classic space characters as they struggle with the cosmic and emotional turmoil of space. It was by far the most challenging and time-consuming project I have worked on, crafting the story, animation, music, and visual effects. To see the idea I had three years ago now fully manifested so close to how I imagined is beyond satisfying. I hope you enjoy watching it as much as I enjoyed creating it. please leave any questions on the making of the film in the comments and I will answer them. plus check out my Twitter for behind-the-scenes and news on future projects.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Lego stop motion animated movie inspired by the classic space theme","title":"LEGO SPACE!
