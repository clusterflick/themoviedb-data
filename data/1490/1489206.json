Soprano Sonya Yoncheva makes her highly anticipated role debut as Lisa, the young woman who embarks on a deadly love affair with the gambling-obsessed officer Hermann, sung by tenor Arsen Soghomonyan in his Met debut. Baritone Igor Golovatenko reprises his moving portrayal of Lisa’s fiancé, Prince Yeletsky, alongside mezzo-soprano Violeta Urmana as the spectral Countess and baritone Alexey Markov as Count Tomsky. Keri-Lynn Wilson conducts the sweeping score.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4YRTHAf3R28NSJM3rd7kqfmURnu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15005,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Metropolitan Opera","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":220,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Metropolitan Opera: The Queen of Spades","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1683797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonya Yoncheva","original_name":"Sonya Yoncheva","popularity":0.6261,"profile_path":"/7KgfzEZluTl9HIQBqwHaew4WJRA.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lisa","credit_id":"683774813c2f159f0feb4153","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5469135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Barakova","original_name":"Maria Barakova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Pauline","credit_id":"683774930e7cbb032703845c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1437846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Violeta Urmana","original_name":"Violeta Urmana","popularity":0.4829,"profile_path":"/zGa3HY51AzmGavOWxZkOAKeCnjE.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Countess","credit_id":"683774aa8928f411f4eb403a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2422263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arsen Soghomonyan","original_name":"Arsen Soghomonyan","popularity":0.102,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Hermann","credit_id":"683774b8d9b03bb27105640a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5469138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Igor Golovatenko","original_name":"Igor Golovatenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Prince Yeletsky","credit_id":"683774cca64da04346b6c806","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1724542,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexey Markov","original_name":"Alexey Markov","popularity":0.5748,"profile_path":"/vxLsapYCjh0yE5YvlTvVluJ1xW7.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Count Tomsky","credit_id":"683774db440c078c6bb6c552","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1281066,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pyotr Tchaikovsky","original_name":"Пётр Чайковский","popularity":1.3422,"profile_path":"/zTnrtuLddN6KYU3gVVepEiAsgek.jpg","credit_id":"6837751d3e3a24251c05656e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3152209,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Mark Thompson","original_name":"Mark Thompson","popularity":0.2061,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683775a6f6e032a5472b828d","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1792014,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Paul Pyant","original_name":"Paul Pyant","popularity":0.2109,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683775b48121cf5b6f730f10","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1030389,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elijah Moshinsky","original_name":"Elijah Moshinsky","popularity":1.2847,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6837763a42e8a4d2df2b8398","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/4YRTHAf3R28NSJM3rd7kqfmURnu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
