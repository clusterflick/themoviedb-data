She also happens to be an MMA fighter with a mum who doubles as her coach.  Her mother, Mei, has always planned everything for Ari - her training regime and now her dating regime so she can find the perfect partner, and have the perfect baby at the perfect time in her life.  In a bid to escape her overbearing mum-coach, Ari enters an illegal underground MMA fight where she manages to piss off the most dangerous man in town, James Lee.  Swords, cakes and the truth go flying when they all collide at her cousin's big fat Indian wedding.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Give Me Babies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
