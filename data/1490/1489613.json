The grounds of Rome’s Villa Albani Torlonia are the setting for dreamlike scenes in which ghostly figures clad in costumes associated with the films of Fellini, Visconti, Pasolini and more interact with the models as they prepare to unveil the House's latest creations. Featuring cameos by the photographer Brigitte and members of the House’s ateliers, this enchanting episode of magical realism is a poetic paean to the powerful femininity the Creative Director of Women’s collections has championed since the start.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/fljOh8Jt4O8fEp3FPcSAgnDpuAb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53334,"logo_path":"/nuY4cvsxmTTHrGATRil6uLLHry5.png","name":"Archimede","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Fantômes du Cinéma","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Ghosts of Cinema","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63973,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matteo Garrone","original_name":"Matteo Garrone","popularity":2.3533,"profile_path":"/bszKQINwwZKe9Ybwdaz8G5a6H7S.jpg","credit_id":"68387c38155bf9d93583903e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932539,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Paolo Carnera","original_name":"Paolo Carnera","popularity":0.6026,"profile_path":"/oSVFcqk0lTbu7gKyQBFGUjJPoDg.jpg","credit_id":"68387c726d7078c861415753","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63973,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matteo Garrone","original_name":"Matteo Garrone","popularity":2.3533,"profile_path":"/bszKQINwwZKe9Ybwdaz8G5a6H7S.jpg","credit_id":"68387c81a639fcf1732b8915","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2064630,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrea Tagliaferri","original_name":"Andrea Tagliaferri","popularity":0.7116,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68387c8e2d5d5fbcfb056788","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3342761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Grazia Chiuri","original_name":"Maria Grazia Chiuri","popularity":0.0702,"profile_path":"/kt4q8nNpYMEQpXPWwgF0ptTtSGE.jpg","credit_id":"68387d03958826d3b141573e","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/58eF5oL9DIyzfAv0318MuXqSNqv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fljOh8Jt4O8fEp3FPcSAgnDpuAb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":588,"name":"rome, italy"},{"id":15479,"name":"fashion"},{"id":321256,"name":"italian cinema"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
