If he succeeds, the missile has the potential to change the balance of power between the East and the West. Rojak is cooperating only because his totalitarian government is holding his wife, Anna, and threatens to kill her unless he completes the missile. The IMF's assignment is to rescue Rojak and his wife and to destroy his missile research. But another unfriendly government has sent professional killer Alexander Ventlos to make certain Rojak never completes his work.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/8LZwFRc6V33kKnSuwnKumbNHjtt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mission: Impossible - The Bunker","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Graves","original_name":"Peter Graves","popularity":3.7189,"profile_path":"/bK7Wf7qmKqixhKqzmBX3gNtzFcS.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"James Phelps","credit_id":"683774b9fa7a79b812838d2b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Landau","original_name":"Martin Landau","popularity":4.3851,"profile_path":"/2BkrH2w5W1lbv8YQQeEHX6mYiEX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Rollin Hand","credit_id":"683774c370315f34812b82e3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Bain","original_name":"Barbara Bain","popularity":2.9448,"profile_path":"/jLUoYMqpxaIR2Vc4YmFCjdM0H6s.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Cinnamon Carter","credit_id":"683774d607c6e8dc98a890e3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Morris","original_name":"Greg Morris","popularity":1.9544,"profile_path":"/l4pyAMumC6p1V4aqxBra7PWlTvN.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Barney Collier","credit_id":"683774df86aa54c7c0a87b53","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Lupus","original_name":"Peter Lupus","popularity":1.4933,"profile_path":"/6GxndAwamcoQJqpK5MwYdiYj5be.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Willy Armitage","credit_id":"683774eb440c078c6bb6c556","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107331,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Llewellyn Moxey","original_name":"John Llewellyn Moxey","popularity":2.6062,"profile_path":"/4XyBGODx6NiRiNQEqs4Vy0CR4aR.jpg","credit_id":"6837750ba5f2332a31730c79","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1217451,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Playdon","original_name":"Paul Playdon","popularity":1.1272,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6837751c794f0e3db2838e24","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8LZwFRc6V33kKnSuwnKumbNHjtt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1969-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
