In this short documentary, we explore what it’s like to live next door to one of the most iconic racetracks in the world. From booming pub beer orders and overflowing village shops to the quiet resilience of locals who call Silverstone home all year round, this film captures the remarkable contrast between rural life and high-speed spectacle.  Featuring interviews with residents, business owners, and community leaders, we shine a light on the people behind the paddock — and what happens when the circus comes to town.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/alLyBS8U1Vmn0PmbOXaNGsM27gn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":263674,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beyond the
