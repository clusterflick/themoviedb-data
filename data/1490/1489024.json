It is a magical land of vast expanses, strange rock formations, countless rivers, cascades and glaciers. Its skies are laden with moisture and its Northern latitude accounts for seemingly endless (spring) days marked by eerie twilights. This windswept and desolate earth paradoxically vents great heat and energy from its inner core. RESTLESS evokes some of the power of this young Earth. - AZ","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Restless","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2083637,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrej Zdravič","original_name":"Andrej Zdravič","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68372472154e691f8a038032","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
