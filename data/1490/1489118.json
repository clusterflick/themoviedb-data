When asked to reflect on the collections at the Huntington, I was instantly drawn to the 1665 edition of Micrographia, a seminal work of observations made with the aid of a microscope by the great natural philosopher Robert Hooke. As I subsequently wandered the gardens and collections I searched for resonances in texture and form, seeking out plants and objects that suggested the exquisite delicacy of the engraved illustrations in Micrographia.\" (Charlotte Pryce).","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ftOwG8SvKiclx3rUnmO5uhqQoMR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Micrographia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1698721,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charlotte Pryce","original_name":"Charlotte Pryce","popularity":0.102,"profile_path":"/gUeegGflKO3JKFL7mctCrZkrHxw.jpg","credit_id":"683748a53e3a24251c0564b4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ftOwG8SvKiclx3rUnmO5uhqQoMR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":843}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
