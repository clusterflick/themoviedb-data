God strikes back and turns the whole planet into fictitious characters from the Batman franchise. The Joker hunts down Bane and they agree to join forces and torture the world with Cinematic Venom episodes but soon get distracted by Batman's presence. Meanwhile, The Riddler and Poison Ivy convince Two Face to help them brainwash the whole world with Riddler's invention - before more Batmen show up, and the world's attack begins. God is hell-bent on destroying them all, while his son Jesus tries to stop all of this madness.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":263697,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinematic Venom","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dark Knight Stumbles","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5469714,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Boor","original_name":"Rob Boor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6837cdd4b5fd941a5c2b82ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5469716,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Moshenko","original_name":"Alex Moshenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6837cdf494584af5ae0565a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3974370","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":189978,"name":"fan film"},{"id":337602,"name":"superheroes"},{"id":345876,"name":"youtubers"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"YouTube","release_date":"2015-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Dark Knight Stumbles Bloopers (Reupload)","key":"T9Q7yoSviMw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Bloopers","official":false,"published_at":"2023-08-16T18:00:12.000Z","id":"6837cfb8958826d3b1415499"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Making Of The Dark Knight Stumbles","key":"2VV_NEh06Ao","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Behind the Scenes","official":false,"published_at":"2023-04-22T18:00:01.000Z","id":"6837cfd08ece7a1dae414ff7"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Dark Knight Stumbles Deleted & Extended Scenes","key":"vhTcHGfHRpY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2023-04-08T18:00:28.000Z","id":"6837cfe6df895e1db1730d91"}]}}}
