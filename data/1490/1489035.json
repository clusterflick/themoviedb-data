It is a road-trip quest by two friends who emigrated from Ireland during the financial crash of 2008 and who have now returned to probe Ireland’s so-called acceptance of debt and austerity. The film uses a visual essay style that mixes observational footage, vox pop, music and archive material to unravel the modern incarnations of Irish identity, post-colonialism, nationalism, globalization and resistance.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eat Your Children","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2085614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Treasa O'Brien","original_name":"Treasa O'Brien","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683728cc640e05b428b6c628","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5468413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mary Jane O’Leary","original_name":"Mary Jane O’Leary","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683728d88928f411f4eb3ee2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5859496","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
