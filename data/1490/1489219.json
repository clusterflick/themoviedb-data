It's 1930 and a gang has been terrorizing the locals for what seems like forever. But it's finally about to come to end with the arrival of Dingetjie and Daan, two mismatched brothers who aren't too bright, but can shoot and fight. They get a job looking after cattle for a local matriarch, but the gang gets Daan framed for bank robbery so they can steal the cattle. Dingetjie blows up the jail to spring Daan from captivity, and the local sheriff sets off after them, with a big shoot-out ensuing in the town square. Apart from its outrageous humor, savor Hal Orlandini's stand-out performance as the curiously fastidious villain.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dingetjie Is Dynamite!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1078807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Leonard","original_name":"Don Leonard","popularity":0.4391,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Daan van der Merwe","credit_id":"6837798ed8c5a82db5038498","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1165973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wena Naudé","original_name":"Wena Naudé","popularity":0.3226,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Ouma Hessie","credit_id":"6837799c11dcee8735838eaa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2958364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roelf Laubscher","original_name":"Roelf Laubscher","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Dingetjie van der Merwe","credit_id":"683779afd8ca74a9dab6c686","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4273137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Douglas Watson","original_name":"Douglas Watson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Floors","credit_id":"683779bb86aa54c7c0a87b75","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":588157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Hall","original_name":"Ivan Hall","popularity":0.6942,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683779f333db2fb1fa056205","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1013911,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"C.F.
