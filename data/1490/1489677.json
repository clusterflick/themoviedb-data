Prominently featured are shots of actress/model Hope Hampton, showcasing the latest French fashions from designers including the House of Worth, Lanvin, and Jean Magnin. These scenes were originally featured in the 1926 shorts Parisian Modes in Colour and Colorful Fashions from Paris, both of which were photographed in Kodak’s color film studio at the Eastman School of Dance and distributed across the US by Educational Pictures as part of the McCall’s Color Fashion News series.\"\r — James Layton","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1926-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Examples of Color Cinematography Produced by the Kodachrome Process","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4295536,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jules Brulatour","original_name":"Jules Brulatour","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"683897588f47ed8371b6ca7c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4130168,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Loyd A.
