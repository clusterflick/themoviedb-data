The film explores how a prolonged war changes society, political narratives and personal reality. Through his own biography, performances, dialogue with his father and the transformations of the Ukrainian queer community, the author shows the collision of identities, cultures and ideologies. The war becomes a background for deeply personal stories and visual narratives that merge into an artistic manifesto.","popularity":0.0297,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What You Will Do When The War Continues?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5365588,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladyslav Plisetskiy","original_name":"Vladyslav Plisetskiy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f97750d4c444a1cc99e996","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5365589,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Vladyslav Plisetskiy","original_name":"Vladyslav Plisetskiy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f97761d4c444a1cc99e9af","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5365590,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nataliia Vyshnivska","original_name":"Nataliia Vyshnivska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f97770d3ab7d7a8badb79f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2307590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bogdana Kosmina","original_name":"Bogdana Kosmina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f977867b43bdce20aea48e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sunny Bunny LGBTQIA+ Film Festival","release_date":"2025-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
