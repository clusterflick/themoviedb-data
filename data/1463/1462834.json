But Njoh aka Kabongo, his elder brother is eagerly waiting for that day as he stands to inherit all of Lisoso’s property (which includes his wife Veronica and children, Sonia and Loise) as demanded by tradition if the dead man has no male child. But Sonia is declared the heir on the day of the will reading by the barrister appointed by Lisoso. Kabongo enlists his idle son and his cohorts to track down the Barrister and reclaim the will.
