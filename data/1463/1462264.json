It is a simplistic creation consisting of color and rhythm. It incorporates X-ray images, figures from Pompeii, and footage of a turtle in Syria. This creation story symbolizes the ability to generate something new and release it, akin to a primordial soup of pixels. The animation emphasizes the constant act of looking, viewing, perceiving, and receiving images. It portrays the relationship between the photographic technique, the apparatus itself, \"the machine,\" and the complexities of distortion in perception and imagination. The film was created using a broken special effects machine from the 1990s, resulting in the destruction, overexposure, underexposure, abstraction, and, ultimately, in the freedom of the material.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sun To Me Is Dark","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2401651,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lina Selander","original_name":"Lina Selander","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f76c8e31775276d6d96694","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
