After being attacked at a party, he wakes up alone in an abandoned house - while Radiohead’s “How to Disappear Completely” plays. The film ends with a haunting post-credits scene where partygoers, indifferent to his absence, continue their night, leaving it unclear whether he was ever truly there, or if his existence was all in his mind.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":259088,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dūmu Domas","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2025-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"He vanished quietly.
