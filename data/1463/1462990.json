The structure of the film stages a conversation between black-and-white 16mm film and iPhone images as ways of representing that beauty. The film concludes with a coda in the form of a half-roll of film shot on my camera by Robert Todd that, in many ways, responds to the hand-wringing in the previous three sections.","popularity":0.0474,"poster_path":"/c1Vkbsnv1uSkYOKnti782wDO4ze.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"de rerum natura","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1331274,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roger Beebe","original_name":"Roger Beebe","popularity":0.1583,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f9730df81b02b0809916aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1196705,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Todd","original_name":"Robert Todd","popularity":0.2395,"profile_path":"/cuZKZxxq9qMoA8phahxJJ3PLMxe.jpg","credit_id":"67fd079dde5e4dec62ae38a5","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1331274,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roger Beebe","original_name":"Roger Beebe","popularity":0.1583,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fd07c2de5e4dec62ae38be","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1077,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/veEY7kcMJHgOFBwIk3T3diCL86b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1915}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1077,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/c1Vkbsnv1uSkYOKnti782wDO4ze.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":718}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
