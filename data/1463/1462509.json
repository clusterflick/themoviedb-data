In 1984, director Aleksandr Kuprin created the theatrical composition \"December 21\" and created a theater group to implement it. The first production took place in the attic of the Palace of Culture of the Moscow Electric Lamp Factory, and then the director of the palace, Aleksandr Vainshtein, brought the performance to legal venues. This film is an interweaving of fiction and documentary and a brief history of Russia.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/g3JVX6ZIyCaMAlfuRaakzQS9vHn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"December 21","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3061615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aleksandr Kuprin","original_name":"Aleksandr Kuprin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f812081bc639566ad9b0a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1104,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/g3JVX6ZIyCaMAlfuRaakzQS9vHn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":780}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
