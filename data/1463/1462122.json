From their eyes, we see their dad’s alcoholism.  They are full of life, joyful and sometimes full of melancholy. The protagonist only lives their normal life. They like riding bikes, reading comic books while dreaming of a fantasy world. They love their dad, he’s often off, but he’s full of tenderness. When they get stung by a wasp, he takes care of their booboos.  Papa Bouteille is a poetic film. It takes the spectator along in the character's own intimacy.","popularity":0.2762,"poster_path":"/dCKzRo27f8S6FMONEvWEyqneA7Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114747,"logo_path":"/2ai9DPmoVXvpzsebWUHYnptCvFE.png","name":"École des Nouvelles Images","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Papa Bouteille","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5360622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucie Carraz","original_name":"Lucie Carraz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f6ec527b43bdce20adf18f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5360625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lalita Bruguiere","original_name":"Lalita Bruguiere","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f6ec6d7b43bdce20adf19a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5360626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clement Bretou","original_name":"Clement Bretou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f6ec7cd4c444a1cc995466","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5360628,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Étienne Mazet","original_name":"Pierre Étienne Mazet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f6ec8931775276d6d933d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5360629,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred Marcassoli","original_name":"Fred Marcassoli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f6ec93de5e4dec62ad09e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2857520,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julien Deparis","original_name":"Julien Deparis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f6ecaede5e4dec62ad09f4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5360629,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred Marcassoli","original_name":"Fred Marcassoli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f6ecc5de5e4dec62ad09fa","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5360622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucie Carraz","original_name":"Lucie Carraz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f6eccf31775276d6d93451","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5360633,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Éléonore Deprun","original_name":"Éléonore Deprun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f6ecf831775276d6d934a2","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5360633,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Éléonore Deprun","original_name":"Éléonore Deprun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f6ed0431775276d6d934a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5360628,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Étienne Mazet","original_name":"Pierre Étienne Mazet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f6ed22de5e4dec62ad0a07","department":"Crew","job":"Special Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5360629,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred Marcassoli","original_name":"Fred Marcassoli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f6ed36d4c444a1cc9954ac","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5360622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucie Carraz","original_name":"Lucie Carraz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f6ed5bde5e4dec62ad0a21","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34542658","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":844,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sZ8Ne4QjmfTYa6dPbqiLrmHxFyl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1039,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dCKzRo27f8S6FMONEvWEyqneA7Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":735}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7464,"name":"alcoholism"},{"id":170361,"name":"neglected child"},{"id":240119,"name":"father son relationship"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":310045,"name":"pastelcore"},{"id":333133,"name":"animated"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"PAPA BOUTEILLE ( 2023 ) - Trailer","key":"xR15b9lQ450","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-09-12T14:23:38.000Z","id":"67f6f321ea80d851759947e4"}]}}}
