Let Me See Inside","overview":"Okay Keskidee! Let Me See Inside is a love letter to the UK Caribbean diaspora, exploring black histories, physical spaces and notions of community. The site of the Keskidee Centre, a pioneering Afro-Caribbean cultural centre, is now occupied by luxury apartments. The closure of such valued spaces where people could gather and organise coincided with the rise of a political discourse which led to a lack of documentation of Black Caribbean pasts. Working on the surface of the film image itself – making use of a rostrum camera and optical printer – filmmaker Rhea Storr reflects on the histories that remain trapped in the archive and how capitalism has affected our connection to the past.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Okay Keskidee!
