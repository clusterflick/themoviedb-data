In the short, Momotaros feels bad that it is really the end of Kamen Rider Den-O as Urataros assures him that all good stories have to end sometime. After Kintaros and Ryutaros try to make sequels to classic stories that cannot have a sequel (A Dog of Flanders and Little-Match Girl), the Imagin end up on the moon in homage to Galaxy Express 999, embracing their final story. A later retelling of this short, Be Forever Momotaros: Imagin Terminal Station, provides an alternate ending where the story does continue with numerous new characters and Momotaros freaks out about it.","popularity":1.3289,"poster_path":"/py8vySo0NDqbY8ShjS7dAyYv0to.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5822,"logo_path":"/qyTbRgCyU9NLKvKaiQVbadtr7RY.png","name":"Toei Company","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2008-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Imagin Anime: Momotaros Forever!/Imajin Terminal Station","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toshihiko Seki","original_name":"関俊彦","popularity":0.7402,"profile_path":"/7jUPvx4hxWZWZJgyiCwd8KxWuvI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Momotaros (voice)","credit_id":"67f6af3fde5e4dec62acf95d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":555099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Koji Yusa","original_name":"遊佐浩二","popularity":1.2517,"profile_path":"/vBo8dHvZvbG4kax0LcaWvrXUZuX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Urataros (voice)","credit_id":"67f6af49d81748ccff9919e9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":219659,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masaki Terasoma","original_name":"てらそままさき","popularity":0.753,"profile_path":"/eol7Ul4buAam9SmJDuFIWln0Cd3.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Kintaros (voice)","credit_id":"67f6af51d81748ccff9919ef","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenichi Suzumura","original_name":"鈴村健一","popularity":0.9233,"profile_path":"/vFqjmIjxfgBkh3ZmUin7QETV0sy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ryutaros (voice)","credit_id":"67f6af5e31775276d6d91322","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1107015,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takayuki Shibasaki","original_name":"柴崎貴行","popularity":0.2751,"profile_path":"/gqa9xxTbM3IDSnAW4mkPolTdXJ0.jpg","credit_id":"67f6b06c6c3583c97599d3ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1324219,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shin-ichiro Shirakura","original_name":"白倉伸一郎","popularity":0.2572,"profile_path":"/h0Wi0mzHDyh3I61cUSi9dc8WYTf.jpg","credit_id":"67f6b09a1bc639566ad9314f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1324219,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shin-ichiro Shirakura","original_name":"白倉伸一郎","popularity":0.2572,"profile_path":"/h0Wi0mzHDyh3I61cUSi9dc8WYTf.jpg","credit_id":"67f6b0a531775276d6d9145f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jSEEn0NLIuZXON2xx67q1iT0OuZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/py8vySo0NDqbY8ShjS7dAyYv0to.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2008-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
