Whoever gathers all of these artifacts will be granted a wish that will be fulfilled instantly.  On the eve of the Generations Cup in \"asyk\", a fierce rivalry ignites between the young world champions and the veteran players — the first national champions — for possession of the Great Asyks. The captain of the elder team comes from a family that has safeguarded part of these precious artifacts, while the remaining \"asyks\" are in the hands of the owner of the young champions’ team.  At stake are not only the fates of many people, but also love and personal ambition.","popularity":0.1048,"poster_path":"/lkNAZyVCfJKLzNtKznjFXKGCVUP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kazakh","iso_639_1":"kk","name":"қазақ"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
