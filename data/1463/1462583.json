Flint is angry and intolerant of most things, but of 'foreigners' in particular. One afternoon, on his way to a PPA meeting, Flint is involved in a serious accident as a result of his speeding. His injuries are severe. Thankfully his life is saved after undergoing a blood transfusion. Flint, grateful to be alive, requests to meet his blood donor in person.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/whesKi3V1vwVus1ssplpZqJCoWt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flint","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5363150,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Riley","original_name":"Joe Riley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Flint","credit_id":"67f84653cce7690230ad3d63","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2282657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Phelps","original_name":"Barbara Phelps","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Flint's Mother","credit_id":"67f84676d4c444a1cc9992d3","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5363148,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Meena Ayittey","original_name":"Meena Ayittey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f845ebd4c444a1cc9992aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5363149,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jude Cook","original_name":"Jude Cook","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f845ff31775276d6d9c386","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2726803,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Holly Greig","original_name":"Holly Greig","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/6ZE52ccWmnW6V50y50pxsMYTw3s.jpg","credit_id":"67f8473dd4c444a1cc99931b","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5427948","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/whesKi3V1vwVus1ssplpZqJCoWt.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
