Slow, roaming shots linger on places of passage and confinement, where movement is measured and controlled. Fragments of stories, words passed from one person to another. Encounters along the way reveal different ways of seeing, different ways of understanding.  Voices emerge, sharing stories from those held inside Brook House, a large immigration centre on Londonâ€™s outskirts. Through shifting perspectives, the film examines migration, control, and the space between perception and reality.","popularity":0.0956,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Notes From Brook House","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3341323,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alex Nevill","original_name":"Alex Nevill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f7c4a31bc639566ad98c11","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
