This documentary offers an insight into their individual experiences of this period in and out of prison, from a historical and personal point of view. The stories of Edda Schönherz, a former TV news presenter, Hans-Joachim (Akki) Lietsche, a former window dresser, and Matthias Leupold, a fashion magazine driver at the time, will make you reflect not only about the past but also about the present.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/7hlE8GxQIPDdeNBxmxvIj9V3GUJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond the Berlin Wall: Reports from Stasi Prisoners","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5365297,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abhiroop Banerjee","original_name":"Abhiroop Banerjee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f96683cce7690230ad8323","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5365299,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Berglind Sóley Elstermann Jansdóttir","original_name":"Berglind Sóley Elstermann Jansdóttir","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f96692d3ab7d7a8badb436","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5365301,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcela Faganello Galluzzi","original_name":"Marcela Faganello Galluzzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f9669d1bc639566ada4f30","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5365303,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthias Leupold","original_name":"Matthias Leupold","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f966a7d4c444a1cc99e5f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5365303,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthias Leupold","original_name":"Matthias Leupold","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f966b6d81748ccff99be3e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7hlE8GxQIPDdeNBxmxvIj9V3GUJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":565}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlin Independent Film Festival","release_date":"2025-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Social Justice Film Festival","release_date":"2025-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"SR Socially Relevant Film Festival New York March 2025","release_date":"2025-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
