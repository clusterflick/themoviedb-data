The only thing he knows is that there is an urge in his stomach that needs to be satisfied. Clyde's lack of knowledge traps him in a cycle of self-sabotage as he tests new methods of feeding the urge with the items fed from behind the telepathic door that constantly reminds him he is \"running out of time\". A race against the clock determines whether Clyde learns to please himself, or dies without fulfilling his needs.  Nazario returns to the directing chair, dipping his toes in the lake of surreal cinema.  DNCHD;FTFIS is a compund of new techniques seen from Nazario infused with the crafty approach that has made himself a household name. Also returning is Nazarios collaboration with rising actor Evan Bell, who starred in the hit mockumentary Evan: Portrait of a Local Fisherman.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/gULnPsGUK60Bhy97ihapRVEfFwN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"When you sit to dine with a ruler, note well what is before you, and put a knife to your throat if you are given to gluttony.","title":"Do Not Crave His Delicacies; For That Food Is Deceptive","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5007063,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isaiah Nazario","original_name":"Isaiah Nazario","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wMtnbvhIJoEks3kSc9ZBaK43JYv.jpg","credit_id":"67f881b37f70ac1a21d91455","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5007063,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isaiah Nazario","original_name":"Isaiah Nazario","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wMtnbvhIJoEks3kSc9ZBaK43JYv.jpg","credit_id":"67f881d5ea80d85175998633","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5007063,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isaiah Nazario","original_name":"Isaiah Nazario","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wMtnbvhIJoEks3kSc9ZBaK43JYv.jpg","credit_id":"67f881e6ea80d85175998643","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gULnPsGUK60Bhy97ihapRVEfFwN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
