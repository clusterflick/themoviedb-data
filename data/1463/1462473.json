Aku Yu had already had written an original song for her. When Nagisa heard that the Shinjuku Koma Theater was to close down, she decided that she would have to rent the hall herself, in order to realize her dream. The concert was a great success, aided by many of her friends, including Wakamatsu Koji, Yamaya Hatsuo, Naito Chin, and Mikami Kan, who grew up in Shinjuku. Director Kawanaka Nobuhiro has fond memories from decades ago, when he was delivering milk and had a chance to talk with the Shinkokugeki actor Ogata Ken in the Shinjuku Koma Theater dressing room. He returns to that room in this film.","popularity":0.0368,"poster_path":"/rZQn6Ga996ZwQYXNEHd8HHEyhN5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2009-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shinjuku Legend: Nagisa Yoko Shinjuku Koma Gewa-gewa Recital","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2546805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoko Nagisa","original_name":"Yoko Nagisa","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67f7ffe1d3ab7d7a8bad5f1f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134811,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kōji Wakamatsu","original_name":"若松孝二","popularity":0.5724,"profile_path":"/v1Dj2S8ee1hJItIqacXa58xnR8E.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67f80009d3ab7d7a8bad5f32","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hatsuo Yamaya","original_name":"山谷初男","popularity":0.4242,"profile_path":"/bRwjfh80Pok32QRZIUpjRwTdExH.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67f8001cd4c444a1cc998791","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305868,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nobuhiro Kawanaka","original_name":"Nobuhiro Kawanaka","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f7ff936c3583c9759a1d07","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rZQn6Ga996ZwQYXNEHd8HHEyhN5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":848},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g7Lzr2RvaSflhJHCM7omz01P5tm.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":848}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
