In his quest to navigate the complexities of the past and present, Gregory’s art rewrites history. The film captures not only a stunning performance but also a powerful physical narrative where he uses his entire body, and movement becomes a means of memory and healing. Poignant, this short film delves into the connection between the artist’s expression and the space charged with both his personal and collective history.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/cADysrrc4bLVGFvcmwIaTymlgEC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":259059,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vizione Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A full body artist, Gregory Maqoma, navigates his own identity through a deeply personal narrative performed at House of Slaves, Senegal.
