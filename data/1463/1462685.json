One of the earliest civilizations to settle in the Americas, the Maya built great cities dominated by huge stone pyramids that were designed to inspire awe among the people. In this program, students will follow archeologists into the ancient tomb of Lord Pacal, King of Palenque and learn the critical role of the king as both the leader of the city-state and a religious icon believed to be descended from the gods. The Maya were masters of astronomy, studying the stars and planets to create a calendar and determine the best times for planting and conducting sacred rituals. Discover their beautiful art and architecture, the detailed written language of glyphs and the value of corn and cacao in the society of the ancient Maya.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/3jcwICWPnGVj9DHmrLMAld2krkM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ancient Maya","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Ancient Civilizations for Children: Ancient Maya","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3jcwICWPnGVj9DHmrLMAld2krkM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":525}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
