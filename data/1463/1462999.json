Home to the University of Michigan and Eastern Michigan University, the communities grew increasingly anxious as police seemed unable to stop the killer—or killers—responsible.  Through interviews with law enforcement, political figures, and women who lived through the fear, this independent documentary examines not just a series of crimes, but the social and political tensions that enabled them—many of which still resonate today.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/3xMbGW4ydmYGEbDDCLDFwQ82ekM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1969: Killers, Freaks, and Radicals","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5365606,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Templeton","original_name":"Andrew Templeton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f979e2d4c444a1cc99ea61","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5365608,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rachel James-Dolan","original_name":"Rachel James-Dolan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f979f41bc639566ada5636","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5365609,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joshua Quintal","original_name":"Joshua Quintal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f97a037f70ac1a21d98343","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5372069,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lauren Dawn","original_name":"Lauren Dawn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fd256f7c29ae5bc3d95780","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5365606,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Templeton","original_name":"Andrew Templeton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fd2586437f0b80eeacfd11","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3xMbGW4ydmYGEbDDCLDFwQ82ekM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":933,"name":"michigan"},{"id":33722,"name":"true crime"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
