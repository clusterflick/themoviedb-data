It features interviews with members of the film’s cast and crew alongside critics, commentators and historical figures, and includes outtakes of Medium Cool. A 55-minute version premiered at the 2001 Edinburgh Film Festival alongside a new theatrical print of Medium Cool and with Wexler in attendance, and was broadcast on the BBC, PBS and the Sundance Channel. A version of the film appears on the 2013 Criterion Collection DVD release of Medium Cool.  The documentary, which has become more an educational project than anything else and remains a work-in-progress, was expanded in 2015 and now runs approximately six and half hours (in six parts).","popularity":0.1778,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":75392,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sticking Place Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Look Out Haskell, It’s Real!: The Making of Medium Cool","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7067,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Haskell Wexler","original_name":"Haskell Wexler","popularity":0.2954,"profile_path":"/k3JSEg2tildKuFl6F6T1gLQSwgf.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"570c12ed9251413c85000ab4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":167625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Cronin","original_name":"Paul Cronin","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"570c1321c3a36802b6000b7c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0296726","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2001-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
