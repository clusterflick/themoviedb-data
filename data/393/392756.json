He is painfully aware he may die from it as well. While dealing with the agony of his loss, Chris is unexpectedly contacted by a mysterious Russian immigrant who tells him his father did not die from natural causes. That his father was an unwitting victim of human experiments in the development of biological weapons. Pursuing the truth behind this strange revelation, Chris learns of Dr. Gurevich, the scientist who created these viruses. He meets Gurevich's beautiful daughter Anna, whose innocence, charm and intelligence ultimately become his greatest obstacle. Unable to contact his Russian informant, unable to decipher Russian documents, unwilling to use Gurevich's daughter as a pawn, Chris struggles to fight symptoms of his own disease, caught between the ticking clock of his own illness and the consuming desire for truth.","popularity":0.8429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":75496,"logo_path":null,"name":"Diamond Films UK","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"In the world of bioterrorism ... there is a coverup!","title":"Death Without Consent","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1214358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chad Doreck","original_name":"Chad Doreck","popularity":0.2308,"profile_path":"/2cPLWWRiIOhpXOCv9uuUsRSm2OQ.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Chris Carrington","credit_id":"631c25d265e0a2007f08ed47","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1605508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonya Vaswani","original_name":"Sonya Vaswani","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Anna Gurevich","credit_id":"570f1b4b92514102b9001bfc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1605509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Merchant","original_name":"Nina Merchant","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Bianca","credit_id":"570f1b6292514143ff0001e4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pawel Szajda","original_name":"Pawel Szajda","popularity":0.4689,"profile_path":"/1ZXXAOfMWj76T6kZpl14P5VOCiP.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Sean","credit_id":"570f1b8092514102bc0019f0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Gabel","original_name":"Michael Gabel","popularity":0.105,"profile_path":"/cRxomoBed64sVgSHjiR2Pw7WSIL.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Sergei","credit_id":"570f1b9cc3a368510a0001d7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Cosham","original_name":"Ralph Cosham","popularity":0.1241,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Dr. Guervich","credit_id":"570f1bb692514143ff000202","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1605510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William L.
