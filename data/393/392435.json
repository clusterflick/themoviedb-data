Shulamit is an independent photographer who documents violent incidents on segregated busses on which women are required to seat at the back.  Both of them were banned by their communities because of their desire to live normal, unsuppressed lives. These young women operate entirely alone and pay a very high price for violating the number-one rule of Haredi society: \"Never air a dirty laundry in public.\"  As they expose the violence of Haredi fanatics, acting in the name of modesty, they are punished by persecution and vilification. What will happen to them when they can no longer bear being shunned by their own family and friends? Wich way will they choose? where will they go?  Black Bus, Soreret, tells the story of their singlehanded and courageous attempts to document and lead a change in the Haredi Society from which they have fled.","popularity":0.4853,"poster_path":"/u4c5pqMg7liTP4BRef3dNxeDsy8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2009-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Bus","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Soreret","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1604579,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anat Yuta Zuria","original_name":"Anat Yuta Zuria","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"570c82789251413840000671","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1604580,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anat Yuta Zuria","original_name":"Anat Yuta Zuria","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"570c8280c3a3684bf9001363","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1604579,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anat Yuta Zuria","original_name":"Anat Yuta Zuria","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"570c828d9251416cee00135e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1604582,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sigal Landesberg","original_name":"Sigal Landesberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"570c82cfc3a3684c150015ae","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1709097","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u4c5pqMg7liTP4BRef3dNxeDsy8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11704,"name":"judaism"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":213971,"name":"activism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"Berlinale 2010","release_date":"2010-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"Haifa International Film Festival","release_date":"2009-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
