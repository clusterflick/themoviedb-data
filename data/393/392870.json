As a young boy, Enzo dreamt of being an opera singer, a journalist or a racing driver, instead he created one of the most recognised company names in the modern world. During his 50-year reign he rarely left Maranello the spiritual home of his beloved race teams and birthplace of the sports cars against which all others are judged and remained a very private man. This superb racing documentary by acclaimed Formula One producer John Tully reveals the essence of the man and his machines. The story is told from childhood, through 4 decades of racecar development, to a visit by the Pope (in an open top Ferrari Pope-Mobile of course!) shortly before Ferrari s death in 1988. Narrated by Christopher Lee, this is the definitive Ferrari documentary.","popularity":0.4759,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Enzo Ferrari 1898 - 1988","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1209545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enzo Ferrari","original_name":"Enzo Ferrari","popularity":0.0901,"profile_path":"/eIHLOgTWJYvxkzj1N50RSTIAKld.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"571000779251416a56001c76","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Lee","original_name":"Christopher Lee","popularity":2.2688,"profile_path":"/4zPu5YaRPbhrcp9aVjXQDjpfwPC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"57100085c3a36860a800222d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niki Lauda","original_name":"Niki Lauda","popularity":0.4185,"profile_path":"/tGYoMEe3v9EE0DzlTVaXTOzLSmy.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"571000999251416a56001c7f","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"DVD Release","release_date":"2012-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
