As this engaging story opens, a retired schoolteacher and his wife are at home with their four grown sons and one daughter. The oldest son is a teacher whose wife is expecting a baby. The youngest son is a student in New Delhi and, defying custom, his young wife opts to go live with her own family while her husband is at school instead of remaining with her in-laws. Will her behavior and that of the younger generation undermine the tradition that holds the society and family together? After the youngest son graduates and gets a job, he and his wife move across the country to New Delhi. As the siblings continue to grow and develop their own lives and families, the mother and father face a gradual and inevitable adjustment to living without them.","popularity":0.3409,"poster_path":"/6CMXuHWvGLJWfvbB7Hz2LGWgWQm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32413,"logo_path":"/jXHqu6xyG8l5mKwK66u5ahzYdfD.png","name":"National Film Development Corporation of India","origin_country":"IN"},{"id":193822,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lotus Films International","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1984-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Oriya","iso_639_1":"or","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maya Miriga","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Mirage","type":"English"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"মায়া মৃগ","type":"Bangla"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3929383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bansidhar Satpathy","original_name":"Bansidhar Satpathy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Raj Kishore Babu","credit_id":"63f1f60b15376c0083365510","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2821231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manimala Debi","original_name":"Manimala Debi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"63ce53587aecc600a271e55a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1611675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kishori Debi","original_name":"Kishori Debi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Grand Mother","credit_id":"5720d187925141449400015b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3929386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Binod Mishra","original_name":"Binod Mishra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Tuku - Eldest Son","credit_id":"63f1f68515376c0083365539","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1611677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manaswini Mangaraj","original_name":"Manaswini Mangaraj","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Prabha - Eldest son's wife","credit_id":"5720d199c3a368119300016e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3790410,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sampad Mohapatra","original_name":"Sampad Mohapatra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Tutu - Second Son","credit_id":"63f1fb48caaca200b9f60fbd","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3929389,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sujata Mohapatra","original_name":"Sujata Mohapatra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Sujata - Tutu's Wife","credit_id":"63f1f702a67254007de8f3c0","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3929391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bibekananda Satpathy","original_name":"Bibekananda Satpathy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Bulu - Third Son","credit_id":"63f1f73ba6725400865d8e8a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3929392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shriranjan Mohanty","original_name":"Shriranjan Mohanty","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Tulu - Fourth Son","credit_id":"63f1f75d4a4bfc00b2f9aff3","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3929393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tikina","original_name":"Tikina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Daughter","credit_id":"63f1f7cf15376c008bc04fb2","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1603973,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nirad N.
