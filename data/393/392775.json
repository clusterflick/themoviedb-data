The heat of August in Paris brings forth memories and at the same time the adult Morder is involved in a love affair. There are no scenes from Ecuador here, and none of the images in the film are used to carry the narration; instead they vaguely illustrate what Morder happens to be saying at the moment.","popularity":0.1296,"poster_path":"/9Yu2jsGVZRzTrg4hTrmojaj8kVB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99548,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trans Octo
