While her mother (Kelly Lynch), like astronaut Michael Collins, goes to the dark side of the moon for a leukemia treatment, Ella must journey on her own to the strange moon of her grandmother's world.

Emotional connections are reshaped, and the music of Patrick Neil Doyle helps tell this unusual story.","popularity":1.4335,"poster_path":"/zUiXlRKYDeW2WwUjkpuHzJVdcau.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
