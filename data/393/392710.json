The work involved extensive travel around the United States, and poses an examination of just what America is/was, or what do we mean when we speak of it. Done in a series of radically different sections which collide with each other in a manner intended to provoke thinking, Plain Talk, which was made by an American and intended for American viewers, was indeed broadcast in Britain, but somewhat predictably, not in the USA.","popularity":0.0763,"poster_path":"/o5DlYPiqFT51G86dID0yPj60kb3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plain Talk and Common Sense (uncommon senses)","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1012097,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Jost","original_name":"Jon Jost","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":"/kYXBWSdUTTGcmJWwMefeZ3nPYmb.jpg","credit_id":"570ea28192514102af000405","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1012097,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Jost","original_name":"Jon Jost","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":"/kYXBWSdUTTGcmJWwMefeZ3nPYmb.jpg","credit_id":"570ea294c3a3685370000594","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1012097,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Jost","original_name":"Jon Jost","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":"/kYXBWSdUTTGcmJWwMefeZ3nPYmb.jpg","credit_id":"570ea26bc3a368536900055e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1012097,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Jost","original_name":"Jon Jost","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":"/kYXBWSdUTTGcmJWwMefeZ3nPYmb.jpg","credit_id":"570ea29d92514102af000409","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1012097,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Jost","original_name":"Jon Jost","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":"/kYXBWSdUTTGcmJWwMefeZ3nPYmb.jpg","credit_id":"59e0067e925141252c0aa882","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1478538,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jon A.
