One day her husband simply picks up and leaves without any explanation whatever. At about the same time, she is involved at an accident at her workplace which makes her strongly aware of the passage of time. Can she once more know the love of a man? She has enough suitors: Charlie, though dull, has been in love with her since she could remember; Jacques is the father of one of her children; Mano has moved to the north of France from Spain, and wants to refurbish her house for her. Without rushing, she carefully considers each man (and her absent husband) in the context of her life, what she wants from it, and what is possible.","popularity":0.1998,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Faut-il aimer Mathilde?","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":19068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominique Blanc","original_name":"Dominique Blanc","popularity":0.3985,"profile_path":"/yxy0yaSu7Zk7gecvjRJ55TBTze8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mathilde","credit_id":"5709ae1c9251415675000b1e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Crauchet","original_name":"Paul Crauchet","popularity":0.138,"profile_path":"/z7ZT4vyrxaVDC5e9Xx8GBx3Nfj4.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Papy","credit_id":"5709ae3092514139d9000efe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Marcon","original_name":"André Marcon","popularity":0.1901,"profile_path":"/tQFEk49npJO1XHh4OfSAjCfQTIz.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Charly","credit_id":"5709ae3d9251415675000b2d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1603493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne-Marie Cappelier","original_name":"Anne-Marie Cappelier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Jeanine","credit_id":"5709ae4ec3a3680fc2000fa6","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":221668,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edwin Baily","original_name":"Edwin Baily","popularity":0.0975,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5709ade792514139d9000ee1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0106879","wikidata_id":"Q3067500","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
