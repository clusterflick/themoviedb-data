Fancher recounts episodes from his life — romantic misadventures with silver-screen stars, wayward acts of chivalry, jealousy, and friendship — matched with a parallel world of film and TV footage wherein Fancher plays cowboys, killers, fops, cads, and the occasional hero. Escapes shows how one man’s personal journey can unexpectedly shape a medium’s future.","popularity":0.6902,"poster_path":"/1O8yWBU1TMYcpsLCdFXnSdal9qL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101835,"logo_path":null,"name":"Survival Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Escapes","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Сбежавший с лезвия","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hampton Fancher","original_name":"Hampton Fancher","popularity":0.4778,"profile_path":"/7Ocd4Xpd0DHA3ZQxPRu5dUCAFjm.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5953b9489251411d980191b7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54469,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Almereyda","original_name":"Michael Almereyda","popularity":0.1678,"profile_path":"/oiMAcT7GwLXBKTYWLl9FDBqrwHX.jpg","credit_id":"60846c4165e0a20029941a62","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1603503,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Piibe Kolka","original_name":"Piibe Kolka","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/rZrvrSpsSNr1FdUDxH7y7togx3q.jpg","credit_id":"5709c4bec3a3687570001913","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54469,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Almereyda","original_name":"Michael Almereyda","popularity":0.1678,"profile_path":"/oiMAcT7GwLXBKTYWLl9FDBqrwHX.jpg","credit_id":"5709c4abc3a36873a60019f4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54469,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Almereyda","original_name":"Michael Almereyda","popularity":0.1678,"profile_path":"/oiMAcT7GwLXBKTYWLl9FDBqrwHX.jpg","credit_id":"5709c4a1c3a36877960024cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5655,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wes Anderson","original_name":"Wes Anderson","popularity":1.9793,"profile_path":"/s03CeUeC5yAXyB1acqP0zGNo2SC.jpg","credit_id":"5953b91ec3a368138803b68f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6815320","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":2034,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3FQIVxQ3JAiHB0VarGayw38Iujk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3615}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":1890,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1O8yWBU1TMYcpsLCdFXnSdal9qL.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":1184,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oYzOPFkkCqQnAJHEsAUcSUGX8hL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":802}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":207005,"name":"chronicle"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Escapes Trailer #1 (2017) | Movieclips Indie","key":"KxOLZla2iK0","published_at":"2017-07-20T18:34:03.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"59724a9b9251415e8603940b"}]}}}
