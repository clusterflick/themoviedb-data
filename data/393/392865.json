The NFU-produced dramatisation is didactic but largely sensitive in making Aroha's story represent contemporary Māori dilemmas (noted anthropologist Ernest Beaglehole was the cultural advisor). Watch out for some musical treats, including an instrumental version of classic Kiwi song, 'Blue Smoke' and a performance of the action song 'Me He Manu Rere'.","popularity":0.3816,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"1951-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Maori","iso_639_1":"mi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aroha: A Story of the Māori People","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1605868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moana Kahui","original_name":"Moana Kahui","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Aroha","credit_id":"570ff9a99251410832000aa2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1605870,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Te Wairangi Korowhiti","original_name":"Te Wairangi Korowhiti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Aunt Ripeka","credit_id":"570ff9bdc3a3684122000d41","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1612404,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Randal Beattie","original_name":"Randal Beattie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62cb8d6fd05a03004c26a65d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1126669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Forlong","original_name":"Michael Forlong","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62cb8d43e24b930052a19207","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1126669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Forlong","original_name":"Michael Forlong","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62cb8d4ae8131d0fb9a78236","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3619555,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Bert Bridgman","original_name":"Bert Bridgman","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62cb8d81595a5612ba10b7a8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1126669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Forlong","original_name":"Michael Forlong","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"570ff98e9251412dd400075c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2667,"name":"maori tradition"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"mi","note":"","release_date":"1951-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
