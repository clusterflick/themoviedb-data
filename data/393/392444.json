Benedict is her imaginary creation: the girl who would respond with strength and mastery to situations she can only submit to. She is married to a cad who says he only married her because she was pregnant, and now he wants his freedom. Her real love is a fellow medical student, who shows some interest in her. Nonetheless, she remains faithful to her unenthusiastic husband, until she becomes pregnant again. At this point, she begins to act more like the Benedict of her dreams and less like the \"Ben\" she has lived as until now.","popularity":0.1902,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ben and Benedict","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":236639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Françoise Lebrun","original_name":"Françoise Lebrun","popularity":0.3749,"profile_path":"/j3ZOQACPmBgVCawF1A4g3lWH2fk.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ben / Bénédicte","credit_id":"570c88ecc3a3684c0a0015c8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Dussollier","original_name":"André Dussollier","popularity":0.5342,"profile_path":"/rw3J5sNFr7VYvTKAPak9d14F7R6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Bernard Chevalier","credit_id":"570c88fdc3a3684bf90014b5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Duval","original_name":"Daniel Duval","popularity":0.1729,"profile_path":"/fhov7IrseaF5WKJ666VVBlxBFO3.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Rémi Peyrou","credit_id":"570c8918c3a3684c1b0015bc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1019367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacqueline Staup","original_name":"Jacqueline Staup","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":"/sZSJHnAyM9hoijBDQvAJBNJq3Vp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ben's friend","credit_id":"570c891fc3a3684c15001711","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1324576,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paula Delsol","original_name":"Paula Delsol","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/la42ipPHTcXK9j3mMxHeFw7CVwi.jpg","credit_id":"570c883dc3a3684c010012ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4167835,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jacques Gauron","original_name":"Jacques Gauron","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b5e7e5a6ddcb00ae6b4ca9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4167834,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Larry Martin","original_name":"Larry Martin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b5e7b80e4fc8519fec84a2","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1433965,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Thi-Loan Nguyen","original_name":"Thi-Loan Nguyen","popularity":0.1699,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b5e7c9e0ca7f00c8cf88fe","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937281,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Claude Nedjar","original_name":"Claude Nedjar","popularity":0.1071,"profile_path":"/6fcrRm5sxbqrKxRXeWZOSm0wcn4.jpg","credit_id":"64b5e7630e4fc8519c1fa1b5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1435919,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Claude Beausoleil","original_name":"Claude Beausoleil","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d7f0f193c43440998a1ae8f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":28097,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Françoise Collin","original_name":"Françoise Collin","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d7f0f216905fb2607b7dade","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1324576,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paula Delsol","original_name":"Paula Delsol","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/la42ipPHTcXK9j3mMxHeFw7CVwi.jpg","credit_id":"5d7f0f0e6905fb0011b875fc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0074198","wikidata_id":"Q2895605","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
