It combines interview with famous U.S. militants of the '60s, such as Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman, with reenactments of their Chicago trials (i.e., the \"Chicago Eight,\" etc.). Other figures of cultural interest from the time, including Alan Ginsberg and Buckminster Fuller, are interviewed or featured. The filmmaker indicates his belief that powerful forces in the U.S. government worked together to suppress American radicals. This view, widely disbelieved at the time, has since been confirmed.","popularity":1.0104,"poster_path":"/cpOE7Z8I02KvxKJARAOBlDnHmOM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1971-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Breathing Together: Revolution of the Electric Family","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1618248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Cox","original_name":"Don Cox","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5732e7f49251413ff5000e0f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1095347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Buckminster Fuller","original_name":"Buckminster Fuller","popularity":0.0644,"profile_path":"/gglDJWwwxAGmvjWmTyv7zuEg7os.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5732e7fcc3a3686078000e66","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allen Ginsberg","original_name":"Allen Ginsberg","popularity":0.1576,"profile_path":"/w7qQvokS1lp7IRgefiJdALaaiIi.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5732e803c3a3686078000e6c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Hampton","original_name":"Fred Hampton","popularity":0.5697,"profile_path":"/qdCaOBsAvAXnJsoECdDLuyHMMEg.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5732e80b9251413ff5000e17","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abbie Hoffman","original_name":"Abbie Hoffman","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":"/zM4EOuvFgw8OfR3ITDv6UHBTciS.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5732e8129251416573002008","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1379855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Kunstler","original_name":"William Kunstler","popularity":0.0717,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5732e819c3a3686078000e72","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy Leary","original_name":"Timothy Leary","popularity":0.1858,"profile_path":"/kFTPQ1ood6HKh1hRRr4wLe76JHN.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5732e821925141656f0020be","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Lennon","original_name":"John Lennon","popularity":1.1493,"profile_path":"/iawyLGZKTr7eD8XWhNGjM8Cb95x.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5732e828925141656b0020bd","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Rubin","original_name":"Jerry Rubin","popularity":0.0721,"profile_path":"/nmnDpu4zy6af6iCDjwo4kYzkOXj.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5732e82f9251413ff5000e21","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1604992,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Morley Markson","original_name":"Morley Markson","popularity":0.0683,"profile_path":"/1yE3c2MdM9kOW5QoGtcxLopi4AG.jpg","credit_id":"570da36d9251413b82000898","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1604992,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Morley Markson","original_name":"Morley Markson","popularity":0.0683,"profile_path":"/1yE3c2MdM9kOW5QoGtcxLopi4AG.jpg","credit_id":"5ee040bff36a32001f8e73b0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60295,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John N.
