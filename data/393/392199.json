This is hardly surprising, given that the neophyte director of this film has a day job as an assistant professor of \"the sociology of conscience.\" Pasolini, who at one point was convicted of the crime of \"offending the religion of the (Italian) state\" (Catholicism), later received the Grand Prize from the Catholic Film Office for his straightforward and stunning film of Il Vangelo Secundo Matteo (The Gospel According to St. Matthew).","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Angelus novus","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1603587,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pasquale Misuraca","original_name":"Pasquale Misuraca","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5709f33d9251412249000aa8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0254092","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
