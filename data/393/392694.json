The film not only depicts an actual 3 dimensional portrait of Rapace being intricately sculpted, but also acts as a portrait of her in itself, by acting as a metaphor for the various chronological steps in the actorâ€™s process. Flying Lotus, the highly acclaimed forward thinking musician and producer provides an exclusive soundtrack of 6 different previously unreleased material, which was born out of conversations between him and Throup at the beginning of the project.","popularity":0.4304,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Portrait of Noomi Rapace","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":87722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noomi Rapace","original_name":"Noomi Rapace","popularity":2.7841,"profile_path":"/zkg9wfbXZi9OqvwW2ku38zNC1Hk.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"570e881192514102aa000114","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1605278,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aitor Throup","original_name":"Aitor Throup","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"570e883ac3a3685378000141","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1605278,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aitor Throup","original_name":"Aitor Throup","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"570e885892514102b6000352","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1056739,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Flying Lotus","original_name":"Flying Lotus","popularity":0.8574,"profile_path":"/8onENZej2ahbQimPaIXybuopXdP.jpg","credit_id":"570e88aa92514102b6000363","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
