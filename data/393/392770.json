More importantly, this is the (true) story of a film theatre in Florence, The Universale, which was a cultural landmark in the city between the '60s and the '80s. It was a theater of its own kind, bringing together intellectuals, students, as well as the people from San Frediano, a well-known working-class Quartiere. Such unusual mixture among the cinema-goers also produced a sort of creative chaos, which is explored through the eyes of Tommaso, the projectionist's son.","popularity":0.4443,"poster_path":"/9vAVx6xil3IC3yKZ1XocY20Fey5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2016-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'universale","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":15,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":585362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco
