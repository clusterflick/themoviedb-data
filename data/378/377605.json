We will travel in wintery conditions from the German border into the lightly held US front line. From the outset small groups of GIs did their best to delay the advance of the panzers, buying time for the vital crossroad town of Bastogne to be reinforced by 101st US Airborne Division. Under the cloak of bad weather, the Germans initially advanced successfully but more slowly than planned However, Germany's chronic lack of fuel hamstrung the advance.  The British XXX Corps deployed to the River Meuse amidst controversy over Montgomery's role and injudicious words but the panzer spearheads were halted short of the river as the skies cleared and the feared fighter bombers returned.","popularity":0.514,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":69941,"logo_path":null,"name":"Battlefield History TV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Battle of the Bulge: Panzer Marche - The Dash for Bastogne","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Battle of the Bulge: Panzer Marche!","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1572872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Weiss","original_name":"Steve Weiss","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself - Presenter and Veteran","credit_id":"56b477b09251415320002f9c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1552508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Dormer","original_name":"Tom Dormer","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself - Presenter","credit_id":"56992f9a925141253a0046cf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1552509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Hone","original_name":"Richard Hone","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself - Presenter","credit_id":"56992fafc3a36875fe0052d4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1550098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Duff","original_name":"Andrew Duff","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself - Presenter","credit_id":"56992fcac3a3687600004725","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1550101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Saunders","original_name":"Tim Saunders","popularity":0.1265,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself - Presenter","credit_id":"56992fdb9251412546004440","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4595,"name":"us army"},{"id":173383,"name":"ardennes"},{"id":185005,"name":"battle of the bulge"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Battle of the Bulge, Panzer Marche!
