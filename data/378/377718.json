Ironside survives the murder attempt, but the bullet has damaged nerves in his spine, leaving him a paraplegic. Unable to gain reinstatement as chief of detectives, Ironside gets permission to continue investigating criminal cases as a citizen volunteer. With the assistance of two former protegees, Det. Sgt. Ed Brown and Officer Eve Whitfield, and a newly-hired aide/driver, Mark Sanger, Ironside sets out to solve his first case as a civilian by finding the people responsible for the attempt on his life.","popularity":2.4301,"poster_path":"/uFnk2cdRTWyvwH1Ai5emKEGR3hy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26727,"logo_path":"/jeTxdjXhzgKZyLr3l9MllkTn3fy.png","name":"Universal Television","origin_country":"US"},{"id":56017,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harbour Productions Unlimited","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1967-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ironside","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Der Chef: Ein beinah t√∂dlicher Fall","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Der Tote, der nicht sterben durfte","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Burr","original_name":"Raymond Burr","popularity":0.8732,"profile_path":"/gsmckogOXPIk6lce2qnNMAFF901.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Robert Ironside","credit_id":"569a44e7925141480300148a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geraldine Brooks","original_name":"Geraldine Brooks","popularity":0.3206,"profile_path":"/pcjhypTQNPz7wAW8v6mc6oIFvz0.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Honor Thompson","credit_id":"569a45e6c3a3686f960014eb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wally Cox","original_name":"Wally Cox","popularity":0.4277,"profile_path":"/dlQJJife09VOMMkB5zhsAJeEpDn.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Scoutmaster","credit_id":"569a460d925141480d0014cd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":15655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Darby","original_name":"Kim Darby","popularity":0.6604,"profile_path":"/w1dwAymNXsi16SAuZZsl2JTEWFd.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Ellen Wells","credit_id":"569a4661c3a3686f98001641","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Sheiner","original_name":"David Sheiner","popularity":0.5012,"profile_path":"/cl37rGKCP5XYHfeGvq37BxpmQEt.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Doctor","credit_id":"569a469b92514148030014c0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":31114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lilia Skala","original_name":"Lilia Skala","popularity":0.3349,"profile_path":"/veiuZGexvC0tnyp8KmU5fWeVE9f.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Sister Agatha","credit_id":"569a46dfc3a3686f96001516","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":153458,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gene Lyons","original_name":"Gene Lyons","popularity":0.1416,"profile_path":"/4OlNbB00am3OLJvaAZ1SBN2pd3R.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Police Commissioner Dennis Randall","credit_id":"569a47c7925141480d00150b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Galloway","original_name":"Don Galloway","popularity":0.2875,"profile_path":"/qIWXB0nUMlA8fLGpGuyMnQqVCg9.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Det.
