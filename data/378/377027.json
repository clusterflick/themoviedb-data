The film tells how a 'brotherhood' of four Danish directors armed with a radical Manifesto, has inspired, outraged and provoked filmmakers and filmgoers the world over. The rules of Dogme95 take filmmaking back to its brass-tacks - stories must be set in the here and now; the films must be shot on location, with a handheld camera, using natural light, and direct sound; the rules forbid murders and weapons (staples of the much-loved action-movie genre); and, most amusingly, the director must not be credited (that holds also for the director of The Name of this Film is Dogme95...).","popularity":0.4752,"poster_path":"/ef8S5y5acfOVPqfQ3DOQMdomASP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12377,"logo_path":"/yL9lfoO2IX6sssqEJuifsOPgcxP.png","name":"Minerva Pictures","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2000-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Name of This Film Is Dogme95","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lars von Trier","original_name":"Lars von Trier","popularity":1.1431,"profile_path":"/a1zVySI0Yqqf3ORegQ1icMfvhAa.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56937ecf92514115c20044ba","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Vinterberg","original_name":"Thomas Vinterberg","popularity":0.4353,"profile_path":"/1lChKBPVLqbn7Kl8lHghybBVzgw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56937ee0c3a3684d0100481c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Marc Barr","original_name":"Jean-Marc Barr","popularity":0.5559,"profile_path":"/ukdhuHD2vqBr5NKMiTQ52KRF75w.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56937ef59251416b16001d92","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ewen Bremner","original_name":"Ewen Bremner","popularity":0.7992,"profile_path":"/d8ZVdFiJHRl43tApt2w43Ha6prf.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56937f07c3a3684d01004825","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1570,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Anthony Dod Mantle","original_name":"Anthony Dod Mantle","popularity":0.0936,"profile_path":"/lxrdzWHzefBPYTllaYDkj3bQBEi.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56937f18c3a36813d0001f62","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harmony Korine","original_name":"Harmony Korine","popularity":0.5038,"profile_path":"/nifHx1FlQdgYw57QaUfHSjBKmPy.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56937f2b92514115ce004aa5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1558,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Søren Kragh-Jacobsen","original_name":"Søren Kragh-Jacobsen","popularity":0.1073,"profile_path":"/6xnfFo4wbM4slCP2qMcFjG3Jtvf.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56937f3ec3a3684cf8004600","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65879,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristian Levring","original_name":"Kristian Levring","popularity":0.0632,"profile_path":"/xegQ3w2bNYfBRvnBa4ZsuF4uWAq.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56937f53c3a3685c540020e2","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4458,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paprika Steen","original_name":"Paprika Steen","popularity":0.3865,"profile_path":"/c0OSsG2akVhYMOrCd3EYNGY4AuN.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"56937f65925141540b001f80","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1717803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Kelly","original_name":"Richard Kelly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"Self -
