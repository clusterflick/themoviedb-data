Mirko left all that behind, but his father messes things up big time when he dies and leaves his son the run down scrapyard - together with his brother Letscho. And Letscho is still ticked off that Mirko deserted the clan. But soon the brothers realize that the Talhammers only have a future if they can pull themselves together and fulfill their father's last wish: to rob a train like real professionals! The coup itself is like a suicide mission, but then Kercher, the Talhammer's biggest nemesis, gets wind of things...","popularity":0.5293,"poster_path":"/xLpN1UjCQ3id6Tba0rSjnidCTai.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45460,"logo_path":"/j5tLpWUFt69O7gGHEWedNcMyLei.png","name":"Tamtam
