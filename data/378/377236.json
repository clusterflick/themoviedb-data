Fatso, now smitten, is determined to win her affection but his clumsiness threatens the relationship of the two, despite Cupid's advice. He dumps a trash can on her head, shoves a bouquet of flowers in her face, knocks her in the mud, dumps a beehive on her head, and knocks her into a cave. Finally, he succeeds in winning her with \"the caveman routine\" only to discover she has a family of kids he must now look after. Furious, he vengefully chases Cupid into the distance.","popularity":0.3076,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":"/x6HLTQILKcImVQ3GvVCwy35W5fz.png","name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1961-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bear and the Bees","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dal McKennon","original_name":"Dal McKennon","popularity":0.2888,"profile_path":"/7ke4WPwpxVsSsYfoibCKEmrI56V.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"56f04112c3a36871890007fd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Hannah","original_name":"Jack Hannah","popularity":0.1754,"profile_path":"/kWFFTlq7VEjbRho2pWLT2zAD05Q.jpg","credit_id":"5695317792514134e6000055","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89284,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walter Lantz","original_name":"Walter Lantz","popularity":0.2364,"profile_path":"/zf5VLzWAmW1mvVMxnMLAJquhric.jpg","credit_id":"56f04126c3a3687179000654","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1565204,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dalton Sandifer","original_name":"Dalton Sandifer","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f04139925141184700073b","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1113209,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eugene Poddany","original_name":"Eugene Poddany","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f04173c3a368718200069d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148245,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ray Huffine","original_name":"Ray Huffine","popularity":0.084,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f0418c9251411847000744","department":"Art","job":"Settings"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1060554,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Art Landy","original_name":"Art Landy","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f0419892514118440006ce","department":"Art","job":"Settings"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148242,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Al Coe","original_name":"Al Coe","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f041aac3a368718e00065e","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1592513,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Roy Jenkins","original_name":"Roy Jenkins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56f041b5c3a368717f000689","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0149823","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1961-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
