Based on improvisations and collective creation work, groups of pre-schoolers, adolescents, and university students from different social, cultural, and political origins, recreate history through mise-en-scenes that come from their own imaginations. The film articulates this creative vortex in a multiple-narrative flowing cinematic mosaic that gives an account of contemporary Chile by reliving its past.","popularity":0.1727,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2004-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clever Monkey Pinochet versus La Moneda's Pig","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1067824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bettina Perut","original_name":"Bettina Perut","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/9gCpIKu69G6nFl6d3XTgDfpS5uM.jpg","credit_id":"5696d6cf92514154d5000240","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1067825,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iván Osnovikoff","original_name":"Iván Osnovikoff","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":"/wWWDBz9tBtKISX52xX0I0CoY7lo.jpg","credit_id":"5696d6c2c3a3683af00001ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0473605","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2004-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
