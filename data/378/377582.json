The prize: $25,000. After both contenders make holes in one, a psychological battle begins. Woody crunches celery. Dapper drives himself into a sand trap. Woody proves himself too light for quicksand; Dapper sinks. At every turn, Dapper proceeds to lure and trick poor Woody until Woody's game seems lost. All that Dapper needs to win is a short putt into the cup, but he's seized with a magnificent case of hiccups. Woody wins and hiccups dollar bills!","popularity":0.6603,"poster_path":"/3whb1rL7q7oTZ6sd1ds3IDVl2af.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":"/x6HLTQILKcImVQ3GvVCwy35W5fz.png","name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1959-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tee Bird","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Stafford","original_name":"Grace Stafford","popularity":0.4184,"profile_path":"/whvCHcXPSfUXx3satHc7Xz9vF3a.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Woody Woodpecker (voice)","credit_id":"5699057ec3a36875fa00407b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dal McKennon","original_name":"Dal McKennon","popularity":0.2888,"profile_path":"/7ke4WPwpxVsSsYfoibCKEmrI56V.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"(voices)","credit_id":"56fc13fa9251412883002f10","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932741,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Paul J.
