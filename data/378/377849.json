Originally conceived as a spy thriller with socio-political overtones, Shadowcrack quickly assumed the form of an outline for a series of Vaudeo™ vignettes with partially overlapping plots to be developed in the near future.

To this end, Rhythm and Noise suggests playback level louder than normal.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shadowkrack","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1564498,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nik Fault","original_name":"Nik Fault","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569acaa09251410cd9000e88","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
