Cavallone followed only loosely the poem, interpolating some of its most outrageous content within the story of a film director, Paolo (Gianni Garko) who’s undergoing a deep personal crisis. The first part (which producer Giuseppe Tortorella labelled \"mythological porn\") is set in Italy, as Marco is working on a film called Maldoror, and focuses on his tormented relationship with a married woman, Monica (Jane Avril). According to the script, it was filled with excessive and cruel images, extracts from the film-within-a-film which were liberally spliced within the plot, and in their uneasiness somehow predated Pasolini’s Salò.","popularity":0.2318,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maldoror","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1139310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inga Alexandrova","original_name":"Inga Alexandrova","popularity":0.1049,"profile_path":"/1fVRZRQrcy2AX37R63kw1JWeAdX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"569a7073c3a36872b70002a8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1282916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Askin","original_name":"Tony Askin","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/wXAtj1SDIMUeuM9ANjRvKUB83Jr.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"569a707d9251410cc6000250","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1564223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martial Boschero","original_name":"Martial Boschero","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"L'operatore","credit_id":"569a70989251410cc4000285","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":52061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sherry Buchanan","original_name":"Sherry Buchanan","popularity":0.3428,"profile_path":"/wzGAR50na3gFhu0V2yd6DeSGPwz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"La ragazza","credit_id":"569a70a99251410cd30002a8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gianni Garko","original_name":"Gianni Garko","popularity":0.4751,"profile_path":"/oE6bdmAZWS8514UdxVVX8e9Rpus.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Il regista","credit_id":"569a70b7c3a36872d000027f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":101569,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Cavallone","original_name":"Alberto Cavallone","popularity":1.4,"profile_path":"/mfCxLkKu07FtuWdoJM9Mhs64S7D.jpg","credit_id":"569a704f9251410cd9000366","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0230495","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
