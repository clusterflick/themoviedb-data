But they are found out, arrested and then bailed. While out on bail, they decide to prove their innocence by actually making a film. They hire a former nightclub bouncer, now a self-made micro-budget gangster film director. In 2011, Paul Knight makes their movie for under £100,000 with a cast of soap and gangster movie stars including Danny Midwinter, Marc Bannerman and Loose Women's Andrea McLean. The film's title is A Landscape of Lies. But the cinematic alibi does not convince the jury when the trial runs in 2013. The producers are convicted of tax fraud and given long sentences.","popularity":0.5314,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":13043,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rise Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":148894,"logo_path":"/5an0hahm40POymfNsytcxyqr6lG.png","name":"Splice Post","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chancers: The Great Gangster Film Fraud","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1572930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Carling","original_name":"Tony Carling","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"56b4a004c3a3680700004721","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1026278,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Knight","original_name":"Paul Knight","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"56b4a01392514114e5004a07","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1015909,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jonathan Sothcott","original_name":"Jonathan Sothcott","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"56b4a01c92514112b9003ce7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1572931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Freddie Foreman","original_name":"Freddie Foreman","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"56b4a02d92514114eb0049bf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1229299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danny Young","original_name":"Danny Young","popularity":0.1071,"profile_path":"/t4EM4R0DM3ogVkqXWe5reEKkC98.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"56b4a03992514114d9004a8a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1026286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Mills","original_name":"Mel Mills","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"56b4a04192514114d9004a8e","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1138234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Lewis","original_name":"Ben Lewis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569a61489251410cca0000ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2171099,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tom Swindell","original_name":"Tom Swindell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bde1b8a6e2d20083e2e0ed","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1040643,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Simon Barker","original_name":"Simon Barker","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bde1befa40460094a76040","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2595208,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Merlin Bonning","original_name":"Merlin Bonning","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bde1c4fa4046007d4e39de","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5135736","wikidata_id":"Q24626334","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4373,"name":"fraud"},{"id":9732,"name":"film in film"},{"id":173259,"name":"arab"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
