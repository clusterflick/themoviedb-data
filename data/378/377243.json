Little Pig is feeling happy and decides to go for a swim. On the way she meets a hedgehog with too few prickles, a crow whose beak is too long, a green lamb and a little calf covered in white spots. None of them look quite 'normal'. They all set off with Little Pig to go swimming. They help out a turtle, who grants each of them a wish. But nothing turns out quite the way they planned.","popularity":0.1342,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7639,"logo_path":null,"name":"PennFilm Studio","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2012-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just a Little","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1562598,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maud Cantoreggi","original_name":"Maud Cantoreggi","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Igelkotten/Kalven (voice)","credit_id":"5695457b9251414276000164","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1105504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sissela Benn","original_name":"Sissela Benn","popularity":0.0958,"profile_path":"/fprO11y9tGCfz6B2gObrPTupHjA.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lilla Grisen/Lammet (voice)","credit_id":"569545c19251413af3000240","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1160786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harald Leander","original_name":"Harald Leander","popularity":0.071,"profile_path":"/qJDAUQrfhntM9xVM8iXfD6If7Ry.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Kråkan/Paddan/berättare (voice)","credit_id":"569545db9251413aea000245","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1562599,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alicja Björk Jaworski","original_name":"Alicja Björk Jaworski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569546209251413af3000257","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1313966,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Clas Cederholm","original_name":"Clas Cederholm","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56954696c3a3687181000281","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1562599,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alicja Björk Jaworski","original_name":"Alicja Björk Jaworski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569546d7c3a368718c0002ab","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1562601,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Magnus Dahlberg","original_name":"Magnus Dahlberg","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56954776c3a36871730002cb","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2251219","wikidata_id":"Q20728173","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sv","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
