I want to awaken the fearless self. A Skinny Man Attacked Daddy takes a look at the family and the place where I grew up. So much of what is 'me' comes from attitudes, expectations, fears, habits, beliefs that I inherited from my parents (and they in turn from theirs). The video is about separation form the family. My work is to try to know myself - the only way to change inherited patterns.' - Vivienne Dick","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Skinny Little Man Attacked Daddy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1285745,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vivienne Dick","original_name":"Vivienne Dick","popularity":0.0613,"profile_path":"/7t7xZuS36Uu3PKcCYWeTdZk9SU1.jpg","credit_id":"5699a49d9251416e7c00061b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
