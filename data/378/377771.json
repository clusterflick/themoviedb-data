In 1960, \"Discos Fuentes\", the oldest record label in Colombia, decided to bet on a new way of producing music, releasing the first mixed album that combined the most important songs of the year. That first album marked a new era in the music production industry in Colombia. \"It was like bringing home the disco every Christmas\". Since then, the \"Hits\" have been a mandatory purchase every December.","popularity":0.222,"poster_path":"/djWKNoI71PxIxKhfID3jvAILYJj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72170,"logo_path":null,"name":"Laberinto Cine y Televisión","origin_country":"CO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"2015-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hits from yesterday, today and always","title":"Tropical Hits","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1564202,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfredo Gutiérrez","original_name":"Alfredo Gutiérrez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Alfredo Gutiérrez","credit_id":"569a6d3b9251410cd000026f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1564203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolfo Echavarría","original_name":"Adolfo Echavarría","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Adolfo Echavarría","credit_id":"569a6d4bc3a36872c7000256","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1564204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eliseo Herrera","original_name":"Eliseo Herrera","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Eliseo Herrera","credit_id":"569a6d599251410cc4000213","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1564205,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julio Ernesto Estrada \"Fruko\"","original_name":"Julio Ernesto Estrada \"Fruko\"","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Fruko","credit_id":"569a6d72c3a36872cb00024e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1564206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilson Saoko “Manyoma”","original_name":"Wilson Saoko “Manyoma”","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Wilson Saoko “Manyoma”","credit_id":"569a6d81c3a36872cb000254","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1564208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chelito de Castro","original_name":"Chelito de Castro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Chelito de Castro","credit_id":"569a6d8d9251410ccd000232","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1564210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gustavo “el loko” Quintero","original_name":"Gustavo “el loko” Quintero","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Gustavo “el loko” Quintero","credit_id":"569a6d9d9251410cca000246","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1564211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisando Meza","original_name":"Lisando Meza","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Lisando Meza","credit_id":"569a6dacc3a36872c0000211","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1564201,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Felipe García-Peña","original_name":"Felipe García-Peña","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569a6c9e9251410cd90002ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1431388,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alessandro Angulo","original_name":"Alessandro Angulo","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569a6ce9c3a36872d000022d","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/djWKNoI71PxIxKhfID3jvAILYJj.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4048,"name":"musician"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2015-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer Cañonazo Tropical","key":"-md68U7RBnE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-11-02T22:29:54.000Z","id":"5ceecdbdc3a3685f151dd3b7"}]}}}
