After early difficulties, he starts to make progress when he forms a relationship with a fellow patient, Emma. But they are forbidden to see each other after Jake is confronted about his \"sex and love\" addiction in a group counselling session. This creates more problems, as Jake doesn't understand that his dependence on the relationship with Emma is actually a barrier to his rehabilitation. A night of excess sparked by drugs makes things get out of hand. Jake decides to leave the center and fight his addiction on his own terms. But almost immediately he goes into a pub. It seems as though Jake will fall back into being an alcoholic, but as the film ends, we see that he has returned to Promis, and is determined to make a full recovery this time.","popularity":0.3091,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Comfortably Numb","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Matheson","original_name":"Hans Matheson","popularity":0.2847,"profile_path":"/9LDEIOewvv16steeZW4BiwNmpw3.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Jake","credit_id":"569a9e669251410cd9000999","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1057876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Palmer","original_name":"Rebecca Palmer","popularity":0.2686,"profile_path":"/fUYuNWtBOrpIIuFEVCL0fQmkk7X.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Emma","credit_id":"569a9e769251410cd6000900","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1258185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leo Regan","original_name":"Leo Regan","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569a9ea39251410cd90009a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1258185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leo Regan","original_name":"Leo Regan","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569a9eb3c3a36872c7000952","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0396539","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
