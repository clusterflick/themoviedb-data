Continuing in the vein of his renowned 35mm epics Water and Power (1989), Trouble in the Image (1996) and Decay of Fiction (2002), the founding CalArts faculty member combines haunting cinematography of the Chocolate Mountains along the border between California and Arizona—long used as a bombing range by the military—with footage shot in L.A., Mexico and Prague, intimate self-portraits, and recurring graphic motifs to create irrepressible, stunningly detailed streams of multilayered sight and sound.","popularity":0.1268,"poster_path":"/8A3JZaTIlKeoWUp4IqCRK2OALjZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where the Chocolate Mountains","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1065736,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pat O'Neill","original_name":"Pat O'Neill","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/AaS3vp38O3zxHWZhGbG4EO9pmRu.jpg","credit_id":"56985293925141253d0014a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7671498","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.54,"height":1482,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8A3JZaTIlKeoWUp4IqCRK2OALjZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-12-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
