There is no narration and no use of archive footage. The participants speak for themselves. The filmmakers spend time with units from many services: army, tanks, marines, ARVN, air cavalry. They accompany an air force napalm and strafing attack on a Viet Cong bunker complex. There are many scenes both of Saigon streets and of peasant village life. Soldiers speak of their experiences and their mission to fight Communism in Vietnam. One American informant says that the Vietnamese peasant is not interested in ideology, but in social justice, a piece of land, fair taxation, and to be left alone. Some interviews are used as voice-over. Participants, American and Vietnamese, are very natural, with little or no posturing for the camera. There are scenes of dead Viet Cong, and one showing a VC suspect being drowned to aid interrogation.","popularity":0.1053,"poster_path":"/A1pIOQ8ZL03IBeyBGhfUxZmiUZK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12113,"logo_path":"/lwnLVleFG0sRAYBq5IObgN30r9F.png","name":"CBC","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1965-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mills of the Gods: Viet Nam","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1395354,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Don Haig","original_name":"Don Haig","popularity":0.0843,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65038cc5ea37e00100521688","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":36162,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Douglas Leiterman","original_name":"Douglas Leiterman","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65038c886a222700aba9d9d0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1673603,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Erik Durschmied","original_name":"Erik Durschmied","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65038c6aefea7a011ab9624d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1342448,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Beryl Fox","original_name":"Beryl Fox","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/v0gyI1XC4XjncW38LHm04YWYHhR.jpg","credit_id":"65038c921bf26600ac76147a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1342448,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Beryl Fox","original_name":"Beryl Fox","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/v0gyI1XC4XjncW38LHm04YWYHhR.jpg","credit_id":"5699dc029251415aad000182","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0236500","wikidata_id":"Q28369556","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eozlf19GjgxqZJjsD7qumvznmeJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A1pIOQ8ZL03IBeyBGhfUxZmiUZK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1965-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
