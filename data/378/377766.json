They acquire it and get an appetite for Rabbit Stew, the featured item of the day on the AT&SF diner-car. They track a bunny rabbit but are foiled by a Dingbat (no, not Edith Bunker) in their efforts to make stew out of the little bunny rabbit. Just as they think they have completed their quest they learn, that the Dingbat has substituted a hornet's-nest for the rabbit.","popularity":0.0423,"poster_path":"/acF5VXvE0nJDOLwogMmu2cMrEDX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42019,"logo_path":"/mFPTppw3q4tY9R2b7QxVv4zevLi.png","name":"Terrytoons","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1950-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All This and Rabbit Stew","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1186343,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Connie Rasinski","original_name":"Connie Rasinski","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569a69239251410cd9000296","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0149621","wikidata_id":"Q115739202","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/acF5VXvE0nJDOLwogMmu2cMrEDX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1950-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
