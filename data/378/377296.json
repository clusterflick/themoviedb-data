All life – human and animal – is dominated by this rampaging weather system. From the northern shores of Australia to the highest peaks of the Himalayas and the wind-blown deserts of northern India to the lush equatorial forests of Borneo, this series makes an exhilarating journey through the lands of the monsoon. Along the way, it offers a taste of the variety and colour of the different regions’ most extraordinary wildlife and cultures and the way they cope with the tumultuous weather. This is the story of a relationship between humans and nature that has grown across thousands of years – all living in the shadow of the monsoon.","popularity":0.8502,"poster_path":"/vhfi6ISuXdpH4YgveD3W4iMk7Vv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8400,"logo_path":"/64seupdfoZOVDBCuY751UUixwLQ.png","name":"Science Channel","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":250,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Step into another world","title":"Wonders of the Monsoon","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"Lands of the Monsoon","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5414,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Salmon","original_name":"Colin Salmon","popularity":0.789,"profile_path":"/mLlAU6Zl2MIL5znp5UHdX3sVTN7.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself - Narrator","credit_id":"580916df9251410f5700bd87","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1580280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kathryn Jeffs","original_name":"Kathryn Jeffs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"580916f89251415dfb010a95","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1697270,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Lyon","original_name":"Nick Lyon","popularity":0.0943,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"580932a9c3a368752b00c9f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1697269,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Clay","original_name":"Jonathan Clay","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58093212c3a36872d600be6c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34954,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nitin Sawhney","original_name":"Nitin Sawhney","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58091715c3a368752b00b94b","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4168608","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ymn60beLXABMycLtZzlo24vvfIa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ndK3mrPZLVc3CGMz8MsR4skcFK0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8JusMSPFVVjPxV8JqNyuSrLvca8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/6zHr7WKzvlvSDOMHiDEt6B1e3ab.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vhfi6ISuXdpH4YgveD3W4iMk7Vv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":851}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5657,"name":"australia"},{"id":2960,"name":"cambodia"},{"id":486,"name":"himalaya mountain range"},{"id":2385,"name":"monsoon"},{"id":5959,"name":"angkor wat"},{"id":14636,"name":"india"},{"id":18330,"name":"nature"},{"id":156053,"name":"bangladesh"},{"id":219392,"name":"indian ocean"},{"id":229231,"name":"mekong"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BBC Two","release_date":"2014-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
