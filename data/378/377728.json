It's made Manne, the farm and casino owner, a very powerful man. Axel's debts are so great he has to do whatever Manne says. So he works in Manne's villa but can at least see his childhood love Jenny, who is now Manne's girlfriend. Axel seeks refuge in his imagination. He has rebuilt the entire village as a model in his cottage. Here, he is king, his word is law. Here, he saves Jenny from Manne and sends him running. One day Axel finds a friend, his neighbor Heiner, a strange guy who constantly quotes Karl May and talks happily with his chicken. Only by joining forces will they bring Manne's empire crashing down.","popularity":0.499,"poster_path":"/iJiitGykku1CBOnaPl3eWSJzhn9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35210,"logo_path":"/41NPHKSaV2kFGRfmgzm97wWQEHF.png","name":"Ostlicht
