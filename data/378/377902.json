In this film, the viewer is invited to experience the garden as an embodiment of ma, a Japanese concept that conveys both time and space... The aesthetic of the film is the message, it has the quality of an experimental film, a conceptual film-an artwork in itself. Good balance of music/visuals/titles. If not as compelling for some viewers as for others, still rated as very effective. Makes one want to visit the actual garden and experience its spiritual energy. – Art on Screen","popularity":0.1252,"poster_path":"/ev5s2ogbSEXHjwQH2QtL6NiCkwW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157580,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Program for Art on Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MA: Space/Time in the Garden of Ryoan-ji","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Ma Space Time","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1702692,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Arata Isozaki","original_name":"Arata Isozaki","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f573d833a5330046e77d69","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3163508,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Gongen Nakaoka","original_name":"Gongen Nakaoka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f57460b84cdd0045b235ec","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1736918,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Susan Brockman","original_name":"Susan Brockman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f5742933a5330046e77de9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3163504,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hideo Kondo","original_name":"Hideo Kondo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f573fa8258fc005c1a5726","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305145,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takahiko Iimura","original_name":"飯村隆彦","popularity":0.1918,"profile_path":"/yOQilAdmhPQbSz6hUBDQr1E9dMO.jpg","credit_id":"569b7854c3a36872cb002918","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305145,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takahiko Iimura","original_name":"飯村隆彦","popularity":0.1918,"profile_path":"/yOQilAdmhPQbSz6hUBDQr1E9dMO.jpg","credit_id":"569b784a9251410cd6002897","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1591744,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Takehisa Kosugi","original_name":"Takehisa Kosugi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc796160e0a263743effd50","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0279935","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ev5s2ogbSEXHjwQH2QtL6NiCkwW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
