Two of them use jury-rigged batteries to power a camera and make a documentary. We see a variety of approaches to survival, from the artist and engineer who trade for their needs, to the surfers and woodsmen who fish and hunt, to the scavengers, and a communal farm. We also see how the community deals with those who threaten it, and how the youth are growing up with different values from those who knew our world.","popularity":0.2326,"poster_path":"/pJvyF49D68iakVlYDusmdz7gGXw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20072,"logo_path":null,"name":"Epidemic
