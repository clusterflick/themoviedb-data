Besides playing the usual venues they challenged themselves and played in buses, caf√©s and for Indian tribal elders. Music video director Emmett Malloy followed the band and managed to capture both the special tour, extraordinary concert versions of the band's minimalist, raw, blues-inspired rock songs and the special relationship between the extroverted Jack White and the introspective Meg White - a formerly married couple who for a long time claimed to be siblings. The film makes striking use of the band's concert colors: red, white and black.","popularity":0.7805,"poster_path":"/ddYQd5ARAA6ZpDC0WuCOIdZeO2U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The White Stripes: Under Great White Northern Lights","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":36,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack White","original_name":"Jack White","popularity":0.5088,"profile_path":"/cqn3AKfLGtzKBsXHqHM3W5HNVeI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe457a9251416c91033d41","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":106969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meg White","original_name":"Meg White","popularity":0.0896,"profile_path":"/c1qROcYHjp930k2Kl2fotiy1LKu.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe457a9251416c91033d45","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82222,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emmett Malloy","original_name":"Emmett Malloy","popularity":0.0849,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56fff4a0925141677d0028ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1487275","wikidata_id":"Q1937820","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/3dJjNrlqzAOySEW3VhJzRKKGHNv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5H6RuRzGkKNyn3dECX2fkxqqpxP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xyYVYewBIUsCHJVUdbZIZJJlFHq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ddYQd5ARAA6ZpDC0WuCOIdZeO2U.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4BLgHkeW6bbqDuFSlIrQhUr7mQU.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.525,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w0GVA4WMATijl1r6d92o1LPmuSp.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":630},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/chWcRaQ1rLd4Os9Ab5mh71woATM.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1329,"name":"canada"},{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":9249,"name":"backstage"},{"id":11700,"name":"rock music"},{"id":156205,"name":"concert film"},{"id":192515,"name":"garage rock"},{"id":196067,"name":"blues rock"},{"id":198299,"name":"live music"},{"id":208817,"name":"indie rock"},{"id":220546,"name":"touring"},{"id":246377,"name":"music documentary"},{"id":254742,"name":"musical duo"},{"id":337314,"name":"live performances"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB (Toronto International Film Festival)","release_date":"2009-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB (South by Southwest Festival)","release_date":"2010-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The White Stripes - Under Great White Northern Lights Trailer","key":"eYGt3i1DjFA","published_at":"2009-12-14T21:22:53.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec693c3a3685448004328"}]}}}
