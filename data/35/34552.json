Unfortunately for Chase, many people believe that man to be him. Though his son is among the missing, Chase remains the main suspect in the case. However, Knox, a reporter, is the only one who believes Chase didn't do it. And although he has a few crazy theories of his own, Knox promises to help Chase find the real killer. But as time goes on, and more mysterious deaths occur, the truth behind the crimes just might be the one thing Chase refuses to believe in: The Jersey Devil. Something is lurking in the woods of Leeds Point; Something that will change Chase Jackson's life forever. Leeds Point is a feature length film about New Jersey's most prolific legend: The Jersey Devil.
