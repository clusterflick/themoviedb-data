It was followed in 1993 by a short film, roughly 20 minutes in length, known as the \"Broken Movie\". The movie wove Broken's four music videos together via a violent \"snuff film\" and included its own video for the song \"Gave Up\" as its conclusion. Due to its extreme graphic content, the Broken Movie was never officially released. But in Christmas 2006, NIN secretly released it on BitTorrent along with the free 2 DVD set closure deluxe prototype.","popularity":0.4541,"poster_path":"/vQN9f0g72sippJHYwOoPpS48g0P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nine Inch Nails: Broken","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":23,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Broken Movie","type":"informal alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Nine Inch Nails: Broken","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3186,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Trent Reznor","original_name":"Trent Reznor","popularity":0.297,"profile_path":"/v6DcTfFqFTFaR8gqMK6sOODKS0T.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe45729251416c91032b91","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":80891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Flanagan","original_name":"Bob Flanagan","popularity":0.1053,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"601ee04d90cf51003c1b57a5","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1073773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Christopherson","original_name":"Peter Christopherson","popularity":0.1155,"profile_path":"/b7TjpWqYzIyu0eCpKTW3fTJZo6X.jpg","credit_id":"571eba469251417e8a0005e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3966667,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serge Becker","original_name":"Serge Becker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64149e50a6c104009a0057c2","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78391,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Reiss","original_name":"Jon Reiss","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64149e6125cd850085ed63b8","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4184059,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Goode","original_name":"Eric Goode","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c30829eec4f300e7099ba0","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3186,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Trent Reznor","original_name":"Trent Reznor","popularity":0.297,"profile_path":"/v6DcTfFqFTFaR8gqMK6sOODKS0T.jpg","credit_id":"601ee0b5c58acd003ea87b03","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3186,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Trent Reznor","original_name":"Trent Reznor","popularity":0.297,"profile_path":"/v6DcTfFqFTFaR8gqMK6sOODKS0T.jpg","credit_id":"601ee0c931d09b0041e65da1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0103885","wikidata_id":"Q2925977","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":780,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cTPp9BYfxw8QdfITk0hZMeko6S5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1387},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lsk4DEjAENGumeGvxStGMTI4OU4.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jp4E8VRhz2WbN2Sfjxlo3PW9fp8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1366},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4ASCAT6g9VwI5KI0FC8axfz2byO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1281},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":725,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8oSDJsxL8gYcsElBEklplkoL8VZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1290},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":726,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/umr8V1DmMco8QCMmsIybZwqiAxT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1291},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":726,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dbXrOcZqqw8WVvwWuu3Df0Q2nyS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1291}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vQN9f0g72sippJHYwOoPpS48g0P.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.73,"height":2232,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mXg6mawL7iJIkJe4daaJfpyYyeT.jpg","vote_average":2.066,"vote_count":5,"width":1629},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h9MmgenpKG5t7e3fUpz4JOHuUpQ.jpg","vote_average":1.066,"vote_count":5,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3880,"name":"snuff"},{"id":5699,"name":"music video"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Nine Inch Nails - Pinion","key":"XfW0ke4bwI4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2010-02-12T02:15:50.000Z","id":"5eb3aa460cb3350020c7fa13"}]}}}
