The plague is spreading in medieval England. The remote village of little Griffin is also threatened. But the 9-year-old boy has a recurring dream that holds the key to a tiny hope of survival: a lake with a coffin floating on it. A white church with an iron cross. A falling glove. A falling silhouette. A torch tumble through a dark shaft into infinity. With his brother he recognizes in it a prophecy to escape the Black Death. So they embark with a few men on a journey to a distant cathedral, where they want to set up an iron cross as an offering to God. Her path leads them through a deep and dark mine shaft into an unknown land and completely outlandish time - into the present-day New Zealand of the 1980s.","popularity":2.018,"poster_path":"/u0aeBvYoaT98Q4IefWuStISdyuK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14591,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arenafilm","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":106936,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Investment Corporation of New Zealand","origin_country":""},{"id":126586,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Australian Film Commission","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":294,"logo_path":"/a05DY2oSeUOVFDM61RsQa9x9RoC.png","name":"New Zealand Film Commission","origin_country":"NZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"},{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"1988-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An Odyssey Across Time.","title":"The Navigator: A Medieval Odyssey","video":false,"vote_average":6.163,"vote_count":80,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"The Navigator: A Mediaeval Odyssey","type":"alternative spelling"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Navigator: An Odyssey Across Time","type":"video title"},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"중세에서 온 사람들","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Der Navigator","type":"theatrical title"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Der Navigator - Eine Odyssee durch die Zeit","type":"DVD title"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Der Navigator - Eine bizarre Reise durch Zeit und Raum","type":"new DVD title"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le navigateur: Une odyssée médiévale","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Navigator - Un'odissea nel tempo","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"El navegante: una odisea en el tiempo","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Навигатор","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Navigator: Uma Odisséia No Tempo","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"中世纪的导航者","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Navigaattori","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Navigatören","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Der Navigator - Eine mittelalterliche Odyssee","type":"TV title"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"ウイザード","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Навигатор.
