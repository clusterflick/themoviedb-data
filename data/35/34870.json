Medea is the tragic character that after helping Jason in the Voyage of the Argonauts (myth says that she has even sacrificed her own brother for Jason's success), she gets from him only betrayal, as he arranges to marry the King's of Corinth daughter. The king decides to exile Medea, as she is a danger for his daughter happiness, but Medea asks from him just a day… before she goes outside the borders. That day Medea gets her revenge.","popularity":0.9236,"poster_path":"/cvTeUfwf2za9Yx2xn7W1unrW3ot.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119,"logo_path":"/1di2gITGUZr730AMuMKiCrP90Vl.png","name":"DR","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1989-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Medea","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":73,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Медея","type":"Russian
