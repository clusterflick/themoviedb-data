Director Jem Cohen's relationship with band member Ian MacKaye extends back to the 1970s when the two met in high school in Washington, D.C.. The film takes its title from the Fugazi song of the same name, from their 1993 album, In on the Kill Taker.  Editing of the film was done by both Cohen and the members of the band over the course of five years. It was shot from 1987 through 1998 on super 8, 16mm and video and is composed mainly of footage of concerts, interviews with the band members, practices, tours and time spent in the studio recording their 1995 album, Red Medicine.  The film also includes portraits of fans as well as interviews with them at various Fugazi shows around the United States throughout the years.","popularity":0.3299,"poster_path":"/bYxZIsDecDPP4B2ukrodb7F0120.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5449,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dischord","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Instrument","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":23,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Instrument: Ten Years with the Band Fugazi","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Fugazi: Instrument","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian MacKaye","original_name":"Ian MacKaye","popularity":0.0959,"profile_path":"/hWGVc8Ng7o6IxGCv7dDH9gZugF.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe45629251416c91030663","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":74330,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brendan Canty","original_name":"Brendan Canty","popularity":0.0772,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe45629251416c91030667","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":112255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Lally","original_name":"Joe Lally","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/pCk09YD8qcOdmzX7beuGxjYYvoH.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe45629251416c9103066b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":112256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy Picciotto","original_name":"Guy Picciotto","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/ogAwClTvNC6IrWBneOyXYBUZFMe.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe45629251416c9103066f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jem Cohen","original_name":"Jem Cohen","popularity":0.134,"profile_path":"/3xNsHx8jz7bZrfxGCbDfSIfDcdT.jpg","credit_id":"52fe45629251416c91030675","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":112255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Lally","original_name":"Joe Lally","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/pCk09YD8qcOdmzX7beuGxjYYvoH.jpg","credit_id":"650adccdaede591ab00f9c5b","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian MacKaye","original_name":"Ian MacKaye","popularity":0.0959,"profile_path":"/hWGVc8Ng7o6IxGCv7dDH9gZugF.jpg","credit_id":"650adcd90d5d850138e74806","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":74330,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brendan Canty","original_name":"Brendan Canty","popularity":0.0772,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650adcc0d6c3000150e6b716","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":112256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy Picciotto","original_name":"Guy Picciotto","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/ogAwClTvNC6IrWBneOyXYBUZFMe.jpg","credit_id":"650adce6d6c30000edefdab1","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3773617,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Samuel M.
