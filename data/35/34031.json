Incorporating footage from John and Yoko's original film Imagine (clips of which were previously included in the 1988 documentary Imagine: John Lennon), Gimme Some Truth presents Lennon, Ono, coproducer Phil Spector, and a host of gifted musicians in a fluid context of conflict, community, and craftsmanship. Bearing witness to every stage of the recording process, this 63-minute documentary succeeds as a visual diary, a study of familiar music in its infancy, and a revealing portrait of the then-30-year-old Lennon--from witty clown to confrontational perfectionist--at the peak of his post-Fab Four inspiration.","popularity":1.0921,"poster_path":"/nK0DWRqdrBud46pt5qzCcOlhKgg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118016,"logo_path":null,"name":"Andrew Solt Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2000-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gimme Some Truth: The Making of John Lennon's Imagine Album","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":17,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"John Lennon Gimme Some Truth","type":"Prima messa in onda su Rai 5"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Lennon","original_name":"John Lennon","popularity":1.1493,"profile_path":"/iawyLGZKTr7eD8XWhNGjM8Cb95x.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe454c9251416c9102d995","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":96082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoko Ono","original_name":"Yoko Ono","popularity":0.4298,"profile_path":"/j254dQthJu2rR1DRXqRkvo1oUqN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe454c9251416c9102d999","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Harrison","original_name":"George Harrison","popularity":0.9156,"profile_path":"/zwUO2gnKBnSrKOB9hnhI9GdOX6e.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5bc1ff11c3a3682d4e02d032","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Spector","original_name":"Phil Spector","popularity":0.1879,"profile_path":"/sCWVTDNUn7Ni7Ct79njisdnJTNc.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5bc1ff1f0e0a266e6b02fac9","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81186,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrew Solt","original_name":"Andrew Solt","popularity":0.0997,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a3d97820e0a2620e900422c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0243925","wikidata_id":"Q60854305","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9QepnwKGkvyT0RFYJuuftzYgwOx.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xKhRTcCrvp0ShloLH2O7S1Iikul.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2tUn0OkvLu5YpSWYuW2kkHoUSTQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/taTMmdgQoIJFjGgNSSISjrwghtt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nK0DWRqdrBud46pt5qzCcOlhKgg.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5kiJUXJFxc9aGxP58nga4z5htx3.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1400},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xEcUxNRWtEBPgxncCCUBOV1iStS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"John Lennon 'Gimme Some Truth' 70th Birthday catalogue campaign - trailer","key":"bRNkTSfQf6g","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2010-10-08T23:32:58.000Z","id":"6202d4e96e3deb001bbcfab0"}]}}}
