It is based on an interweaving of scenes of moaning and sex. The house is the characters' common space, but the question of ownership is distended, they don't all inhabit it in the same way. As the sequences progress, we don't find the same characters but the same interdependent relationships. Through the alternation between lament and sexuality, physical and verbal communication are put on the same level. The film then deconstructs, through its repetitive structure, our relational myths.","popularity":0.1969,"poster_path":"/u6d3bVEVqT949RW9x9zuaapWxkW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141055,"logo_path":null,"name":"Misia
