Touching and sometimes frank, the film looks at issues around acceptance but there are also moments of humour, such as Steve's bad luck when bumping into his mother on his first night out presenting as male. The short also features an interview with April Ashley.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/zhr79dhXfHzR5Swzo8r01mGM0Yi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What Am I?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zhr79dhXfHzR5Swzo8r01mGM0Yi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
