At the University of California, Santa Cruz, UCSC, where I went to college, there were many fans of The Grateful Dead. They called themselves Deadheads. I had not heard of the band before attending the school. I listened to the music, and I didn't understand why people felt so passionately about the band. I was intrigued. So in 1986, I decided to try and understand these people and the music they loved, and to create a video of my quest. This documentary project is the result. Enjoy.","popularity":0.2642,"poster_path":"/qvLisJA60904bF2xK2sPZvgJAj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"a short and entertaining film about the fans of the Grateful Dead","title":"DEADHEADS","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Garcia","original_name":"Jerry Garcia","popularity":0.1168,"profile_path":"/6jAKLIekOs6FFcc783PZ1pb8soe.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"61d655cc31644b006634deab","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3370995,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Notowitz","original_name":"David Notowitz","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d614ba9defda001c0263a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qvLisJA60904bF2xK2sPZvgJAj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"DEADHEADS, a short and entertaining film about the fans of the Grateful Dead","key":"5pF2m-QPcE0","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2016-03-29T21:06:51.000Z","id":"61d61dc4700bf70040e9b2d5"}]}}}
