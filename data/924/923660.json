He left behind Johannesburg, where he was born, raised and worked, and moved to Tel Aviv Israel, where he still lives today. \"Magnificent Failure\" follows Rubin's journey back to Johannesburg 44 years after his hasty departure. In Johannesburg of the 1950's Rubin was a leading artist, with a clear political agenda against the rule of apartheid, which he expressed in his art and music. Despite the prohibition of those days, he played Jazz with top black musicians like Kippie Moeketsi, Hugh Mesakela, and Jonas Ngwangwa. The blasphemy charge, with a pending imprisonment sentence, cut short his diverse and promising career. In Tel Aviv he has continued, for the past four decades, to paint and make music, this time aiming his arrows at mainstream Israeli society, but his audience eludes him.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"From Johannesburg to Tel-Aviv and back: the story of Harold Rubin, the musician and artist who was tried for blasphemy.","title":"Magnificent Failure","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1329395","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
