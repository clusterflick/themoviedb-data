Marcia has spent most of her 11 years living with her Jamaican grandmother but is sent to damp, dark London to start a new life with her parents. Missing her gran terribly, Marcia is surrounded by bullying schoolgirls, racism on TV and a jealous younger brother... Only her favourite pop star will help her feel at home.  Concrete Garden is a wonderfully observed graduation film from director Alrick Riley. With warm performances from a young cast and exquisite detail in the production design, this tender short film powerfully evokes the trials and tribulations faced by kids settling in 1950s Britain.","popularity":0.9417,"poster_path":"/dplVmZGUztTAqyJPeGp9S9U1ck4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17700,"logo_path":"/30KETxKJcX7cm65WymAKMYPP6C4.png","name":"NFTS","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Concrete Garden","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3369455,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martha Brown","original_name":"Martha Brown","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Marcia","credit_id":"61d439c09defda00428b2d45","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3369456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claude Hobbs","original_name":"Claude Hobbs","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"David","credit_id":"61d439ccbfeb8b0066bd1c12","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3369457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudette Douglas","original_name":"Claudette Douglas","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Mum","credit_id":"61d439dd66a7c3001cf7bcc9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3369458,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Owen Williamson","original_name":"Owen Williamson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Dad","credit_id":"61d439e97b7b4d0042eb52c9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5414,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Salmon","original_name":"Colin Salmon","popularity":0.789,"profile_path":"/mLlAU6Zl2MIL5znp5UHdX3sVTN7.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Pop Star","credit_id":"63da7aab22df2e00843cba8d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134696,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alrick Riley","original_name":"Alrick Riley","popularity":0.2417,"profile_path":"/kD6hgDBHyd2f3XGdXDXh9aoMn2f.jpg","credit_id":"61d438a766a7c3008fb930e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134696,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alrick Riley","original_name":"Alrick Riley","popularity":0.2417,"profile_path":"/kD6hgDBHyd2f3XGdXDXh9aoMn2f.jpg","credit_id":"61d438b531644b008f70129b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2021793,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Moore","original_name":"David Moore","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d4391931644b008f701370","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3369454,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Delroy Murray","original_name":"Delroy Murray","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d43984a22d3e008da5c877","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3369450,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Louise Decoteau","original_name":"Louise Decoteau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d438cee194b0006496b5ff","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3369452,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Simon Wilkie","original_name":"Simon Wilkie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d438dfa22d3e001da31737","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2325836,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Lesley Oakley","original_name":"Lesley Oakley","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d439537b7b4d0042eb5212","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0109468","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.738,"height":1494,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dplVmZGUztTAqyJPeGp9S9U1ck4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1102}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12425,"name":"racism"},{"id":18035,"name":"family"},{"id":260012,"name":"black british"},{"id":290152,"name":"windrush"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
