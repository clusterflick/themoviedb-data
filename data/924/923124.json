But when he suddenly leaves the country, she is determined to wait patiently until he sails back into harbour.  Live from Valencia's iconic Palau de les Arts, the audience favourite Madama Butterfly returns with soprano Marina Rebeka and tenor Piero Pretti in the leading roles. Director Emilio López’s staging culminates in the bleak landscape of Nagasaki destroyed by the atomic bomb to evoke Puccini's early outcry against the soul-crushing spirit of colonialism.","popularity":0.2422,"poster_path":"/yLNsaSiLQ9qOlqJVPXss44sLEMt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174190,"logo_path":null,"name":"Palau de les Arts Reina
