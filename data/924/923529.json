They will have the occasion to look back on some of the major figures and events of the Revolution. Lenin Peak, Revolution Peak, Karl Marx Peak, and also the October Glacier and the Soviet Officer range – all names which evoke the Revolution in these remarkable yet little-known locations. He is accompanied by two friends, author and lover of all things Russian, Cédric Gras, and the former Soviet mountaineering instructor, Nicolay Taran. Along the way, the author and his traveling companions observe the traces left by the former USSR on daily life here, and they listen to the memories of the populations who live in the Pamirs, whether Kyrgyz nomads on the high plateaus or Ismailis in the valleys. For Sylvain Tesson, the journey will serve as a source of inspiration for his future writing.","popularity":0.0883,"poster_path":"/tCYjFrKnxZLG6mVFJzZWBxCTeAp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116554,"logo_path":"/1ludvi3gpJO3EH7lwHQTLpSZOOR.png","name":"Nomade Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":110387,"logo_path":"/fJxexB8pz1AidTjsjXmP3BdFMZj.png","name":"Ushuaïa TV","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":310,"logo_path":"/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png","name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Peaks of Siberia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Weißer Oktober: Zu den Berggipfeln der ehemaligen Sowjetunion","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Στις κορυφές της Σιβηρίας","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1891316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johan Andrieux","original_name":"Johan Andrieux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"61d6137312197e006584dee2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvain Tesson","original_name":"Sylvain Tesson","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":"/1G8U6ph3S2BvxSE06xn7i2wzkOx.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61d6137d899da200677091a8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3370980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cédric Gras","original_name":"Cédric Gras","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/r0QUm1kT0kO1vZjq6xhmHqHKEbl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61d61387e10f460042dc1b0d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3370981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolay Taran","original_name":"Nicolay Taran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61d6139252dc7f006b05eb01","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3370983,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Surat Toimastov","original_name":"Surat Toimastov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61d6139f2495ab0040a5690a","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1509213,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Christophe Raylat","original_name":"Christophe Raylat","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d613bd77c01f008d414e28","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3370987,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Laurent Mollard","original_name":"Laurent Mollard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d613d89defda0042906117","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3370986,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Arnaud Humann","original_name":"Arnaud Humann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d613ca12197e006584df76","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1088937,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Françoise Bernard","original_name":"Françoise Bernard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d614396c1e04008ad5d146","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3370991,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean Paul Pellegrini","original_name":"Jean Paul Pellegrini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d6142fb0040a00671f5499","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2538479,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Patrick Morgenthaler","original_name":"Patrick Morgenthaler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d61443c15f89001ca6b3f3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3370983,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Surat Toimastov","original_name":"Surat Toimastov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d613e1700bf70040e993d4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1509213,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Christophe Raylat","original_name":"Christophe Raylat","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d613b5bb2602001c7766ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11958516","wikidata_id":"Q104832984","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tCYjFrKnxZLG6mVFJzZWBxCTeAp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
