They learn that the standard American diet — high in fat, sugar and salt and low in fiber and nutrients — is the culprit behind many chronic illnesses.  With hope, they discover this epidemic of diseases — heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure — may be reversible. By embracing the benefits of a whole-food, plant-based diet, they’re able to improve or reverse their chronic conditions and find renewed energy and vitality. Weaving together personal stories and evidence-based science, PlantWise puts forward an inspiring message of hope.","popularity":0.3252,"poster_path":"/ArpnHqcJPWgTCqC1RUpD0t1DLAN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Eat for Health, Eat for Life","title":"PlantWise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1701487,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul David Kennamer Jr.","original_name":"Paul David Kennamer Jr.","popularity":0.1016,"profile_path":"/2pekXupHHuuFvXZNi9o7RDm81ca.jpg","credit_id":"61d7012152dc7f00417dd71c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3371771,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Merrilee Jacobs","original_name":"Merrilee Jacobs","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/1IEkO0F0yP4rdQR0vFUZY7kfpat.jpg","credit_id":"61d7015a2495ab00654b0a95","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3371775,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Todd Chobotar","original_name":"Todd Chobotar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d70184e10f460042de127e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3371776,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Denise Putt","original_name":"Denise Putt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d701a1899da2001b2afdac","department":"Production","job":"Co-Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ArpnHqcJPWgTCqC1RUpD0t1DLAN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1944},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/of9OKwNpRwdwPXamnKHj8NgN96p.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1944},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iQkbMdAs0Yqeyot1zB474htZhVu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1944}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":237405,"name":"plant based diet"},{"id":241317,"name":"health documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"PlantWise Trailer","key":"p0laDJQCPNo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-11-15T19:27:38.000Z","id":"61d70527e10f46001cf5b411"}]}}}
