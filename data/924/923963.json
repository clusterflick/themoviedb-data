The success of this film showed me that the concepts ‘worked’. Thus, for me, theory is not a dead demonstration. A living theory must be drawn from a personal experience.\"\r - Michel Chion","popularity":0.1206,"poster_path":"/rDNs8jAF8EGXimkH2y59NH7WvYp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eponine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3670463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"elizabeth tamaris","original_name":"elizabeth tamaris","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"La Mère","credit_id":"6300a512bb260200845a14ed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3670465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karine Sacco","original_name":"Karine Sacco","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Eponine","credit_id":"6300a53096e30b00911f8b86","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3670466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cécile Sacco","original_name":"Cécile Sacco","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Virginie","credit_id":"6300a540839d93007e4c042a","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1496137,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Catherine Vilpoux","original_name":"Catherine Vilpoux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6300a55d839d93007b62a328","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1180784,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Chion","original_name":"Michel Chion","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/y7dpVRF5OFQJ7twOVarnYBxgH6i.jpg","credit_id":"61d78f28a055ef00967a9653","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rDNs8jAF8EGXimkH2y59NH7WvYp.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.659,"height":942,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rEy1PUElzSLbUqMU7dDMFQbLflk.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":621}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
