School playground. Classes are over, and students are having fun and noisily leaving school. The rain has just ended on the street, and there are many puddles on the asphalt. And on the passage itself - the largest and widest puddle, it is almost impossible to get around without getting your feet wet. Teenagers gather in flocks and think about how to overcome the puddle. A boy in a wheelchair appears, followed by a teenage girl. It is obvious that the guy likes the girl, and he likes him. The boy smiles and deftly puts the heroine on his lap, and, to the surprise of his classmates, transports the heroine through a large puddle in a wheelchair.","popularity":0.1546,"poster_path":"/7ALNRks9Nvm087Ez0gYxDLHgxC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2018-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inclusion in School","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Inclusion","type":"alternative english title"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Інклюзія","type":"alternative short title"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Інклюзія в школі","type":"alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3014118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oksana Taranenko","original_name":"Oksana Taranenko","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d6de71b0040a0042a2ae43","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3006533,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrii Rizol","original_name":"Andrii Rizol","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/ud5MJgcbM2zrL0vTCbaueLJmGNc.jpg","credit_id":"61d6dea077c01f0067c3881a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2262878,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Oleh Shcherbyna","original_name":"Олег Щербина","popularity":0.0951,"profile_path":"/kKkWUAvbmNpMVCVnir4BhALfKa6.jpg","credit_id":"61d6decbbb2602005b9bb688","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2262921,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yuliia Cherniavska","original_name":"Юлія Чернявська","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/n4lmqS0VQ3ztLmcQaLBTLKV8gDR.jpg","credit_id":"61d6def777c01f001dd441db","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9856266","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"dyvysukrainske","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/7ALNRks9Nvm087Ez0gYxDLHgxC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Brukivka - Kamianets-Podilskyi International Film Festival","release_date":"2019-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Molodist Kyiv International Film Festival","release_date":"2019-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Тизер фільму \"Інклюзія в школі\", режисер Оксана Тараненко, проект \"Дивись українське!\"","key":"21c30AWi-7I","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2018-11-29T09:39:46.000Z","id":"61d6dc7da22d3e0043162249"}]}}}
