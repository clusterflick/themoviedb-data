The band comments: “Although festival performances and band changeovers can be a logistical nightmare, this one turned out to be a very special show for us on our first extensive US tour. Despite battling with some technical issues, the show went on, so to speak, and here we have handpicked our favorite 4 tracks from that performance. A proverbial cherry on top was getting Mike Portnoy to agree to come on stage and re-enact his cameo appearance on 'Crystallised' with his signature gong!”","popularity":0.1018,"poster_path":"/gBkHwTFrVjyqRxIiUQZI4FKvGGi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":167447,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lucid Lounge
