He explains that educating people about this story would help Virginia “get its rightful recognition for this historic event.”  Woodlief, as president of the nonprofit Virginia Thanksgiving Festival, promotes this account of the first American harvest-time celebration and educates the public on it. He first presented the idea of a documentary to WCVE PBS in hopes of educating more people about what he believes is the story of the very first Thanksgiving.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/g4YvLN5VXMwW2ouGpSzLMmIE1O0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124017,"logo_path":"/ioSRRQqdux1jFOxjBI5jUxcruGW.png","name":"PBS","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Virginia claims to initiating this traditional celebration","title":"The First Official Thanksgiving","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3324059,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Tait Roberts","original_name":"Paul Tait Roberts","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674033fc015d2e0f702df9ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3324059,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Tait Roberts","original_name":"Paul Tait Roberts","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674034114dfa06b5df92e832","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt20217332","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t9kfl1Yg9NxL1j51VyTplAAcEJk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g4YvLN5VXMwW2ouGpSzLMmIE1O0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"WCVE/WHTJ","release_date":"2016-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
