The storming of the U.S. Capitol brings the United States to the brink of a political abyss. An angry, armed mob invades the Congress building to prevent Joe Biden from being officially confirmed as the winner of the 59th U.S. election and thus becoming the 46th President of the USA. The lie about Donald Trump's stolen election victory explodes into violence, five people die in the heart of U.S. democracy. The attackers' actions are documented almost completely, as is the helplessness of the security forces. Since then, most of the perpetrators have been identified and charged. But the rift in society continues. Many Republican congressmen remain with Trump, a renewed candidacy for the presidential election in 2024 is still possible. The attack on the U.S. Capitol leaves a shock with all convinced democrats. How could it possibly come this far? This documentary tries to reconstruct and analyze from very different perspectives.","popularity":1.7505,"poster_path":"/k7qPPnYbfRcES0SHdXhpP5aWhsP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89110,"logo_path":"/qLFHtDLgfkclvTtzXKu5sPHNywr.png","name":"ECO Media","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2022-01-04","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Storming of the Capitol - An American Trauma","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"L’assaut du Capitole - Le traumatisme américain","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Der Sturm aufs Kapitol - Angriff auf Amerikas Demokratie","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"ZDF-History: Der Sturm aufs Kapitol - Angriff auf Amerikas Demokratie","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Assalto a Capitol Hill - Un trauma Made in USA","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Atak na Kapitol - Amerykańska trauma","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Asalto al Capitolio - El trauma americano","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1647876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Henrik Wöhler","original_name":"Hans Henrik Wöhler","popularity":0.0828,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"61d5f6ce4975600067ad11ed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3252749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Fanone","original_name":"Michael Fanone","popularity":0.1201,"profile_path":"/lHmzixxD9L5qPvEDkctZIY7DaRw.jpg","cast_id":32,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"61d5fcabd48cee001cef9673","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3370866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aquilino Gonell","original_name":"Aquilino Gonell","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":36,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"61d5ff5131644b001c05c4e9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3017346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Moore","original_name":"Robert Moore","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":24,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"61d5fa5b6c1e04008ad58d6c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3370836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Harnik","original_name":"Andrew Harnik","popularity":0.0437,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":33,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"61d5fd10d48cee006618027f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2697976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elmar Theveßen","original_name":"Elmar Theveßen","popularity":0.1538,"profile_path":"/hVWTYGLqiRJM47Yg4ygXZdA8cCO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"61d5f4df9b8616001a7b512f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3370858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert C.
