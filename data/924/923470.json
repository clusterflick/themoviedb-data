The two lovers disappear into the privacy of the nightclub and its lounges with carpets and goldfish in the glasses. But their harmony is disturbed by the arrival of a man: Susan cheats on Lisa with Fred. Between jealousy and bottles of Johnnie Walker, the triangle explodes in a luxurious apartment. More elegantly, we will move from the lounge to the police station, where the officer of service will make a duty to lecture them. For the trio there is only one alternative: collective suicide in a classic car, they launch themselves at the bottom of the cliff in order to free themselves from the weight of an misunderstood existence. No one kills anyone: death is a deliberate choice in the face of the tragic absence of an alternative in a world that only condemns.","popularity":0.0838,"poster_path":"/eq9BPEwk8RjppVEEKUIhWMFn1RU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35606,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Vision Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Così, così... più forte","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Les chercheuses de plaisir","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1134197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susanna Levi","original_name":"Susanna Levi","popularity":0.1133,"profile_path":"/ykmjOp49FHEmURYMsW9wTYuAKFb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Susan","credit_id":"61d5d5a7a22d3e001da76edc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1615228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Chaplin","original_name":"Margaret Chaplin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Lisa","credit_id":"61d5d5b877c01f0042ab44be","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2598261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Bardella","original_name":"Mario Bardella","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Giudice","credit_id":"61d5d5d1a22d3e001da76f48","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3370734,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gina Giuli","original_name":"Gina Giuli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"61d5d5e4b0040a00671ea2e7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1129962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Malsson","original_name":"Anna Malsson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"61d5d5f9497560001c127922","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3370735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alessandro Masselli","original_name":"Alessandro Masselli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Fred","credit_id":"61d5d60fd48cee0066178436","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":31543,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniele Patucchi","original_name":"Daniele Patucchi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fd91ade0ec51008b001568","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1134194,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angelo Pannacciò","original_name":"Angelo Pannacciò","popularity":1.96,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fd917075f1ad0067562b9c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1197085,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Girolamo La Rosa","original_name":"Girolamo La Rosa","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fd91868e20c500ce99bc2c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1134194,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angelo Pannacciò","original_name":"Angelo Pannacciò","popularity":1.96,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fd915e4c1d9a00425bbc42","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1083202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luigi Petrini","original_name":"Luigi Petrini","popularity":9.815,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fd914c5b370d008eee69ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0197377","wikidata_id":"Q113548251","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eq9BPEwk8RjppVEEKUIhWMFn1RU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
