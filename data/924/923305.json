Perhaps because of her parents’ unique philosophy, she believes herself to be a real princess who must find her way back to her palace one day. Nonetheless, she enjoys her life in Seoul. Gong Joo hides her royal identity to those around her, and has fun mingling with common people. When she is old enough, her dad tells her the truth, and Gong Joo feels very happy with the fact that she is one of the common people. She accepts that the whole time, she’s never left the lost palace. What matters to her is people’s love and tolerance.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/23I4Np4oMfggzNhKtA2GS7cGRBK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2021-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Princess' Fruit Stand","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":2551,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/23I4Np4oMfggzNhKtA2GS7cGRBK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1819}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
