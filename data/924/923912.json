Nowadays, the traditional way of life of the Sámi people living in minority groups and their own identity inevitably arouse conflict with modern systems. To Anita Gimvall who is a Sámi tribe who has lived a lifetime in Lapland, it shows a cross-section of the recent arson incident in a traditional house. To the North for Nonexistence traces out a conflict and alienation at the ambiguous border between past tradition and modern life, settlement and deportation, thought and sharing, and stories of blurred boundaries and backgrounds inside and outside.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/uQxix4lOsxnKx00ysczaxd4sL3k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To the North for Nonexistence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3372134,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sejin Kim","original_name":"Sejin Kim","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d7605ce194b000649f0381","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uQxix4lOsxnKx00ysczaxd4sL3k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
