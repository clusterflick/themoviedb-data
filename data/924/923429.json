Frank Speakman has been to a rural congregation, and is entertained by the members. He is considered a fine catch matrimonially and the ladies set their caps for him. A pretty little milliner is among the contestants and the new minister cannot be blamed for favoring her. The widow with whom the new minister boards, finds an unfinished letter which really is being written to Speakman's sister. The sister's name is Ellen and the milliner's the same, so the letter is an excellent weapon in the hands of a gossip.","popularity":0.0906,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":29949,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lubin Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Preacher and the Gossips","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur V.
