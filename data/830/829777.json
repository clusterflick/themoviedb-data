What sort of magic? It is the magic that every man in some degree experiences during his life at the sight of a young woman. The film talks about Achilles and the daughter of the Priest of Apollo but since then I read an 1841 account of how George Washington was smitten when unexpectedly he saw a young woman sitting under a tree in the wilds of what is now western Pennsylvania reading a poem. He was young, too, and if the story is true he must have forgotten Martha, to whom he was then engaged. But the story of the magic is true - through thousands of years it has been the same surprising story.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bolex","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1193385,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Gutman","original_name":"Walter Gutman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609f0447014325005811d49d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
