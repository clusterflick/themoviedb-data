The theme of the year was borders, nationalism, identities, tourism and immigration. The ‘Becoming Ithaca’ performance was comprised of three parts. The islander who dresses up in national costume to attract tourists. The soldier defending his island from immigrants. And finally, the man stripped down to his humanity, who inspired the poem.","popularity":0.063,"poster_path":"/nIudzesuRuQiRAAqWwTFDUhPhR2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"I dive naked without home country without identity to become the sea with you the sea does not understand borders","title":"Becoming Ithaca","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3090080,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dimitris Pagonis","original_name":"Dimitris Pagonis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"621de5975c324700448f0883","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":2182653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Menelas","original_name":"Menelas","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/710IEZUSepY3e9z9t90ZFzKFti2.jpg","credit_id":"621de5877719d70044efe2c0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":2182653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Menelas","original_name":"Menelas","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/710IEZUSepY3e9z9t90ZFzKFti2.jpg","credit_id":"621de58de7c097006a96ac1f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3090080,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dimitris Pagonis","original_name":"Dimitris Pagonis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609e76a40f0da50029b7a53b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":2182653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Menelas","original_name":"Menelas","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/710IEZUSepY3e9z9t90ZFzKFti2.jpg","credit_id":"61676f1ae4b576008cb4cfda","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nIudzesuRuQiRAAqWwTFDUhPhR2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
