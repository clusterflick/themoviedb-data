But most are not aware of the impact it had on the people of Hawaii, nor the concerning and largely unaddressed implications of this blunder. Director Nick Lyell captures the diverse reactions to the surreal and traumatic morning when families, soldiers, and tourists were forced to confront an unthinkable reality—an incoming nuclear missile. Just as pressing are bigger issues concerning militarism and colonialism in a state that was once its own sovereign nation. False Alarm provides varying perspectives on the situation in Hawaii, including voices of both military members and Native Hawaiians.","popularity":0.091,"poster_path":"/l6vyR9MLtXgN2qOkKqGxCOwDOUT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"False Alarm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3092090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kalama Oka’aina Niheu","original_name":"Kalama Oka’aina Niheu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"60a0c647d4cc8e00580eaf97","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3092091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Arakawa","original_name":"Andrew Arakawa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"60a0c66ab0ba7e00583eb467","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3092092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew LoPresti","original_name":"Matthew LoPresti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"60a0c692e18e3f006fa60dfe","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3092098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colleen Green","original_name":"Colleen Green","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"60a0c8340f0da50058147f16","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3092099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Caron","original_name":"Will Caron","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"60a0c8598e2ba6006e7bb401","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3092100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cindy Rooney","original_name":"Cindy Rooney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"60a0c8686c1e0400591d8d31","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3092101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ava Rooney","original_name":"Ava Rooney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"60a0c878162bc3002addc823","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3092088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Lyell","original_name":"Nick Lyell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a0c545807298006fddd146","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":995,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l6vyR9MLtXgN2qOkKqGxCOwDOUT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":663}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Source: IMDB","release_date":"2021-05-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
