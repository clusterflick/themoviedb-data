At the beginning you see a set of replacement teeth. This still life opens the film, which bears the ominous year 2020 as its title. Even the very first image speaks volumes: a taboo object, almost surrealistic in its loneliness, stands naked in front of us. Only in the following shot is it contextualized. The dreaded set of dental instruments keeps the dentures company. Another shot shows the filmmaker herself who, as a patient, is feeling the agony caused by the tools. Her eyes see only the glare of the dentist’s lamp. Then, in place of her gaping toothless oral cavity, there appears the radiant image of a face adorned with teeth – followed by a nightmarish panning shot, where we see the dentist with his mask-covered mouth.","popularity":0.0439,"poster_path":"/i8KTLWOeFjoU2f2E7RP2KWJl5Sq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2021-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"2020","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1364072,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Friedl vom Gröller","original_name":"Friedl vom Gröller","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/zcZlEUNeMXRnJWPLKkwTqKxKva2.jpg","credit_id":"609e71a1e635710079ebf654","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29803690","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kOAHmtJYHvWzffqTEKhlQdQUemi.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eF54lFUaBBurRH7PuGgP90fSOqc.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/i8KTLWOeFjoU2f2E7RP2KWJl5Sq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Viennale","release_date":"2021-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Media City Film Festival","release_date":"2022-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
