The investigation covered 14 counties and 74 townships within the disaster zone, and studied the conditions of 153 schools that were affected by the earthquake.  By gathering and confirming comprehensive details about the students, such as their age, region, school, and grade, the group managed to affirm that there were 5,192 students who perished in the disaster. Among a hundred volunteers, 38 of them participated in fieldwork, with 25 of them being controlled by the Sichuan police for a total of 45 times.  This documentary is a structural element of the citizens' investigation.","popularity":0.1689,"poster_path":"/zUqI9k9LwMxv6bFSt2nCOVl7tml.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14655,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ai Weiwei Studio","origin_country":"CN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2009-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little Girl's Cheeks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"Hua Lian Ba Er","type":"romanization"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081077,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ai Weiwei","original_name":"Ai Weiwei","popularity":0.3279,"profile_path":"/hD3ot74TFao8xDaeUaxuRK0RKsS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"60a5607a2476f200571820aa","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081077,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ai Weiwei","original_name":"Ai Weiwei","popularity":0.3279,"profile_path":"/hD3ot74TFao8xDaeUaxuRK0RKsS.jpg","credit_id":"60a560962f3b1700584218d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2358995,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Zhao Zhao","original_name":"Zhao Zhao","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c205dcaf6e941e2455156a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2899731,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Li Wake","original_name":"Li Wake","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c205c56a300b004c54ec13","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081077,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ai Weiwei","original_name":"Ai Weiwei","popularity":0.3279,"profile_path":"/hD3ot74TFao8xDaeUaxuRK0RKsS.jpg","credit_id":"62c205a9f1b571004cf74ff1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2614914,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Zhang Juan","original_name":"Zhang Juan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c205d32a210c004dc50227","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zUqI9k9LwMxv6bFSt2nCOVl7tml.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
