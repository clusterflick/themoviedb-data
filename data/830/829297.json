These guitars have been played around the world by music giants like Paul Simon, and this documentary showcases the quiet lives that create some of the most skillfully handcrafted instruments available. Becoming Geppetto gives us an intimate and serenely meditative front-row seat to the Petros’s guitar making process, as well as a look into their family life and history (guitar making went from Bruce Petros’s hobby as an aimless college student to a successful\r and sustaining family business). As a bonus, the film is frequently and delightfully punctuated by wonderful musical performances on those ornate, resonant Petros guitars.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/y5O5BWzF3N6Umy1zc3zoW4tJ7ju.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Becoming Geppetto","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2278567,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dale Lindquist","original_name":"Dale Lindquist","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609d58240f0da50040952471","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y5O5BWzF3N6Umy1zc3zoW4tJ7ju.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
