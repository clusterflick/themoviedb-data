Then the 8mm camera increased participation in the very events it recorded, drawing out the facts of who we are or play at being. In this film, Americans – across stages of life, across decades, in backyards, at a graduation picnic, on a beach and in other ordinary places – reveal silly, happy, intense and sad things about themselves, mostly with exuberance and dignity. The film is arranged without internal editing of the found sequences.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"People Near Here","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1969810,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ron Finne","original_name":"Ron Finne","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609c783c4202280029b20076","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
