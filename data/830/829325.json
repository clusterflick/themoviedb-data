Filled with the colorful personalities, nostalgia and collectibles that are the center of Betthauser and his wife Marilynâ€™s weekly estate auctions, this doc feels as lived in as the homes we visit as Betthauser peruses future estate sales. Alternately humorous and heartbreaking, Bid Caller explores the relationship between impermanent material goods and the important and emotional connections that people imbue them with.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/5l9DL63xQZOLcOYM1p7FAHM14D7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bid Caller","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1163,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5l9DL63xQZOLcOYM1p7FAHM14D7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":775}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
