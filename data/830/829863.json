Harold's\r singing group, \"The Doggie-Town Pipers\", could be just a \"bone's throw\" from stardom if Harold can get someone to listen to their rendition of that great song, \"Dogged If Ya Do, Dogged If Ya Don't\", which went to number one on radio station \"K9\" located on Doberman street in downtown Dogtown.\r Complete with cowboy hats, sunglasses, and a yellow Lincoln convertible, these two real live little\r doggies scratch your funnybone and win your heart.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/n62sPzAZZlTZ13LMQgotngAh9oA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"BORING?
