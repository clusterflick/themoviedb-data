Leistner, who has photographed some of the world’s most dangerous places, credits the challenge of tree-planting for her physical and mental endurance. In Forest for the Trees, her first feature film, she revisits her past to share the lessons she learned. The film introduces us to everyday life on the “cut-block” and the brave souls who fight through rough terrains and work endless hours to bring our forests to life. The rugged BC landscape comes to life magically in Leistner’s photography, while the quirky characters and nuggets of wisdom shared around the campfire tell a sincere story of community.","popularity":0.8095,"poster_path":"/4goHo1mCrKMj39wMJvVs9g1Lo3i.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154286,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leistner
