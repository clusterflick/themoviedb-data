Geothermal development interests, seeking to clear the rain forest for drilling operations, are opposed by native Hawaiians seeking to stop the desecration of the fire goddess, Pele.  Pele is a living deity fundamental to Hawaiian spiritual belief. She is the eruption, with its heat, lava and steam. Her family takes the form of forest plants, animals and other natural forces. But geothermal development interests see Pele as simply a source of electricity.  When Hawaiians take the issue to court, they find that nature-based religions are not respected by U.S. law.","popularity":0.9337,"poster_path":"/hsX63Mu0eUoEwVBM7WJFJ2MNP7N.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pele's Appeal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3090431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pua Kanahele","original_name":"Pua Kanahele","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"609eb960a275020040daded7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3090432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noa Emmett Aluli","original_name":"Noa Emmett Aluli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"609eb96cf5c8240058992d67","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3090433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Palikapu Dedman","original_name":"Palikapu Dedman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"609eb976839018006d4cb57b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3090434,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Auwae","original_name":"Henry Auwae","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"609eb97f2fccee0057240128","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2706963,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Davianna McGregor","original_name":"Davianna McGregor","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/9W0FHQ6pYFAzZgWH0uULGVyj7WO.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"609eb9abe18e3f006fa344d5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3090435,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Takehiro","original_name":"Paul Takehiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"609eb9b4f5c824002991ddcf","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3090436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Luebben","original_name":"Tom Luebben","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"609eb9bba275020040dadf97","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3090437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alapa’i Hanapi","original_name":"Alapa’i Hanapi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"609eb9c52cde980040415314","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3090438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ka’olelo ‘Ulaleo","original_name":"Ka’olelo ‘Ulaleo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"609eb9cfe635710079ec60c6","order":8}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0290805","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1791,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hsX63Mu0eUoEwVBM7WJFJ2MNP7N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1194}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1668,"name":"hawaii"},{"id":235363,"name":"native hawaiian"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Pele's Appeal","key":"DvZwriPLHtc","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2012-05-28T11:05:25.000Z","id":"609eb8fd839018003fcc6926"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Pele's Appeal (TRAILER)","key":"a4SlddW8xwQ","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2012-03-13T07:53:51.000Z","id":"609eba440f0da5004094325f"}]}}}
