Questioning how a change of perspective might alter the sensibility towards an image, the video evolves around positioning a gesture encountered in the movie Még kér a nép (Red Psalm, 1972). The director subsequently encounters this gesture in a photograph of Russian LGBTQIA+ activist Yelena Grigoryeva. She explores that particular symbol by drawing lines to her own queer sexuality, to the aesthetic representation of communism, as well as to questions of dispossession and appropriation.","popularity":0.0619,"poster_path":"/317icUoc1QwFBhYKPxcQs62N6ZI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2021-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Under the Shadow of Azkorri","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3088990,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eszter Katalin","original_name":"Eszter Katalin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609d06d00f0da50058febcd0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/317icUoc1QwFBhYKPxcQs62N6ZI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer to \"Azkorri árnyéka alatt/Under the Shadow of Azkorri\"","key":"459348890","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-09-18T12:16:04.000Z","id":"609d06fbe2726000294a93c0"}]}}}
