He has skills to break into people’s lifes, to break into their privacies. He observes, examins, studies them. He brings people’s lifes to numbers, to simple statistical data. Data by which he comprehends the chaos. The chaos of life. And just as God, Petar only observes lives and does not interfere with the events. However, it is not in a human nature to remain distant and not to interfere with the reality at all. Especially not when Petar’s help is desperately needed. When he sees himself as the ultimate savior of somebody’s life Petar has to act.But for the people, the line between benevolence and crime is so thin that they can not clearly distinguish these two. They can’t recognize and trust an altruism without suspicion. They are bound to disfigure and misjudge any atempt for openhearted aid and call it a fraud or concealed attempt for an assault. Therefore, the savior has to be destroyed.","popularity":0.227,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Macedonian","iso_639_1":"mk","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Letter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1520120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Branko Gjorchev","original_name":"Branko Gjorchev","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"609ff95735a61e0040ebbc48","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1372190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Silvija Stojanovska","original_name":"Silvija Stojanovska","popularity":0.0875,"profile_path":"/4W7XMb9eloHgHlYRdAmCzovWcof.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"609ff934e18e3f002a40872f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3155483,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleksandar Mikikj","original_name":"Aleksandar Mikić","popularity":0.114,"profile_path":"/1wg8jyEEqGKDz0dZRxeBCeGZfbt.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"679cc77c18d39b0264013036","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1493292,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emil Ruben","original_name":"Emil Ruben","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/blWEcZUBSEkygOA4PANgzCinglR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"609ff92a8390180029efa2db","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2175555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vasil Hristov","original_name":"Vasil Hristov","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609ff98e0f36550040e24f17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1169422,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Vladimir Samoilovski","original_name":"Vladimir Samoilovski","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609ff9b1ed2ac200795620c4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2175555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vasil Hristov","original_name":"Vasil Hristov","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625d5467f10a1a31c1f1240f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1537559,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Nikola Lazarevski","original_name":"Nikola Lazarevski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679cc80b16ff832e57bdea05","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2175556,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Goran Acevski","original_name":"Goran Acevski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679cc82295d883ff2501356f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2175555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vasil Hristov","original_name":"Vasil Hristov","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679cc83673712169814d181d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557663,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"René Goossens","original_name":"René Goossens","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/r7n9n68YlAHdSCAW74TbUCjDmmm.jpg","credit_id":"679cc84a16ff832e57bdea19","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":557664,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Annemiek van Gorp","original_name":"Annemiek van Gorp","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679cc85873712169814d1842","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5215920,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Angele Kuzmanovski","original_name":"Angele Kuzmanovski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679cc87573712169814d1854","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Released in 2000, not sure about the correct date.","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
