Iván's mother had been kidnapped by FARC-EP forces and held in captivity for 603 days. As they marched her through the jungles and mountains of the Colombian countryside, she was able to keep a diary that in great detail documented the places she was taken, her experiences and the names and descriptions of her captors.","popularity":0.3904,"poster_path":"/hVO3UILMJGGGrSce5CiVtBZcWBl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80946,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gusano
