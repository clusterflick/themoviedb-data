As members of Jehovah’s Witness start to explore culture outside of their religion, they have to wrestle with the possibility of being excommunicated from friends and family. Featuring in-depth interviews and extensive home video footage, Witness Underground tells the story of punk rocker Witnesses pushing against the highly controlling Jehovah’s Witnesses religion as they build their own community through music and art. This prolific community of Witness musicians create their own record label, Nuclear Gopher, and become early adopters of promoting their music through the internet, including what may have been the first album to ever be livestreamed. This community’s history is well documented through archival footage of their home movies and self-produced music videos, all with a very charming energy.","popularity":0.8461,"poster_path":"/i7SQsajyM5SSpeJLikZbUy09XY6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161986,"logo_path":null,"name":"Banana Island Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Escaping a Cult","title":"Witness Underground","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3101517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Sutter","original_name":"Ryan Sutter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"60ab35c3fcadb4006edb7b82","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3101519,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cindy Elvendahl","original_name":"Cindy Elvendahl","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"60ab35e791b53000587b33c7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3101520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Elvendahl","original_name":"Eric Elvendahl","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"60ab35fa945c200029066a08","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3101521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chad Rhinger","original_name":"Chad Rhinger","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"60ab36203d3557007e163ed2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3101522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Zimmerman","original_name":"James Zimmerman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"60ab363077b1fb00403671d0","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3101515,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Scott Homan","original_name":"Scott Homan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ab35ade92d83002af1053e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4501849,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Siân Walmsley","original_name":"Siân Walmsley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b419395e14e501620c75c7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4501852,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anthony Mathenia","original_name":"Anthony Mathenia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b4196b5541fa0164b198e4","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15215562","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"@WitnessUnderground","instagram_id":"@WitnessUnderground","twitter_id":"@WitnessFilms"},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/i7SQsajyM5SSpeJLikZbUy09XY6.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lXGNEQdhBnGZtE5QUXov9DAzhYS.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":719},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xCaUov01p3mUeXQGLjyLhaL7nRf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1536}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4109,"name":"independence movement"},{"id":6158,"name":"cult"},{"id":11001,"name":"religion"},{"id":18339,"name":"human rights"},{"id":281237,"name":"independent film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Witness Underground (2023) Official Trailer","key":"513647831","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-09-02T18:37:56.000Z","id":"65b41b0757530e0161d9bd8a"}]}}}
