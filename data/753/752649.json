This problem is extremely relevant in the current political situation of Brazil in face of the repeated environmental and social catastrophes that are being inflicted upon us.These people have a way of acting which favours a sustainable development, their knowledge should be respected.The world is divided in two categories, independent of any ideology:the rich world and the poor world.We related the religious rituals, the artistic and the mystic trances in a Brazil where poverty and hunger are invisible to a large part of the society. A country of people that has invisible myths and such a rich diversity is being transformed into a unison and melancholic chant. The Guardians Forest whose leader was murdered last Dec, tells us what motivates their fight.","popularity":0.0589,"poster_path":"/iNfGphm0YFzuDmfQ3Nf7ZmdYh3Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143111,"logo_path":null,"name":"Luba Filmes","origin_country":""},{"id":143112,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paloma Cinematográfica","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2020-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tentehar: Sensitive Architecture","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1386741,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Luís Abramo","original_name":"Luís Abramo","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f84923ee93e95003712aef4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1417046,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paloma Rocha","original_name":"Paloma Rocha","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/AeM2Pc9SQnoISqr1RMTQ3Gx8ntC.jpg","credit_id":"5f8492335a46900038ea0f6c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1417047,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alexandre Gwaz","original_name":"Alexandre Gwaz","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa2847b691cd50036cfb091","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1417046,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paloma Rocha","original_name":"Paloma Rocha","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/AeM2Pc9SQnoISqr1RMTQ3Gx8ntC.jpg","credit_id":"5fa284917d2bc10037e71ca6","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2057558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaime Alem","original_name":"Jaime Alem","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa2846d3a96500038af5d6f","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1386741,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Luís Abramo","original_name":"Luís Abramo","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600a48362a210c0040999e64","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13928990","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8pnuoJqGyDcQumwgLbbqv3MtCG7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iNfGphm0YFzuDmfQ3Nf7ZmdYh3Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
