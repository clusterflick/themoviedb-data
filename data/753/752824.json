Having struggled with his own sexuality, Bartholomew-Poyser believes music can help unite and uplift everyone beyond race, class, and gender. This unorthodox film chronicles his concerts in a women’s prison and teaming up with Thorgy Thor (from RuPaul’s Drag Race and also a classically trained violinist) to create the first orchestral drag show in Canada.","popularity":0.0861,"poster_path":"/ycDIo6CXqgZawPbdgcssWBtHLw6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12113,"logo_path":"/lwnLVleFG0sRAYBq5IObgN30r9F.png","name":"CBC","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":138488,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canadian Media Fund","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Disruptor Conductor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3015795,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Bartholomew-Poyser","original_name":"Daniel Bartholomew-Poyser","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6053ec920e29a200546d091e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1725539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sharon Lewis","original_name":"Sharon Lewis","popularity":0.1862,"profile_path":"/vR8C9eiOvWfHhY4hHwdT4se2e2X.jpg","credit_id":"6053eb505c56340029bec040","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1725539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sharon Lewis","original_name":"Sharon Lewis","popularity":0.1862,"profile_path":"/vR8C9eiOvWfHhY4hHwdT4se2e2X.jpg","credit_id":"6053eb671d820f006b4f06db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1537121,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Byron Wong","original_name":"Byron Wong","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6053ebaf0e29a200736e4fd6","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1325480,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Justin Lovell","original_name":"Justin Lovell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6053ebc22f3b17003dad8216","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2193741,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kejd Kuqo","original_name":"Kejd Kuqo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6053ebd7f48e0d0052f38715","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2090385,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jordan Holt","original_name":"Jordan Holt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6053ebf410923000284b4ef4","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3015794,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tim Bourgette","original_name":"Tim Bourgette","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6053ec08c433ea004f43a69d","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1244105,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charlotte Odele","original_name":"Charlotte Odele","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6053ec21eb79c20053888665","department":"Writing","job":"Story Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3015795,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Bartholomew-Poyser","original_name":"Daniel Bartholomew-Poyser","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6053ec7e8cfcc700539e3131","department":"Sound","job":"Music Arranger"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11187610","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1133,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ycDIo6CXqgZawPbdgcssWBtHLw6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":850}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5783,"name":"classical music"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":246377,"name":"music documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Disruptor Conductor Q&A","key":"tEWEpa3dp8Q","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2020-10-26T10:12:12.000Z","id":"6053edeffab3fa0075afb9ac"}]}}}
