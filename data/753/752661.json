The government at the time, which was commanded by the military regime, thought that that small town, in the northeast hinterland, would be ideal for the construction, because there would be no resistance from the locals. So, 73.000 people were displaced - it is one of the biggest forced migrations in the history of Brazil. Four cities and dozens of villages submerged. Mrs. Pequenita was the only inhabitant to ever return; there, she lives in a ghost town. She receives the visit of three social agents, who own old videos and photos of the region.","popularity":0.1498,"poster_path":"/iyPlVXFHXm9yCCYqXU6UhcXD9YJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109290,"logo_path":null,"name":"Coisa de
