In a simple farming village surrounded by barren hills, he takes care of a small temple. He looks at his hands: his right is blessed, and his left is deformed. He believes he has healing abilities and goes from house to house to help the sick.  As the seasons pass, this gently-paced portrait of the wandering Jun is interwoven with impressions of village life, with its rituals and festivals, and poverty that makes many people desperate, and some defiant.  Two sheep, destined to be sacrificed, add a grimly poetic note to this uncompromising and moving meditation on fate and the search for meaning. The body cam worn by one of the sheep also makes for some surprising shots. Meanwhile, Jun’s musings gradually reveal more about the crises he has had to endure and the reason for his self-sacrifice.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/jxShKkQtoJnAcdxIsmwThweOagC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2019-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ballad of Roaming Spirits","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2813093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jia Kai","original_name":"Jia Kai","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f84b6f8e93e950037130c17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223320,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Li Xiaofeng","original_name":"Li Xiaofeng","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/x0Ia0HicCnbrh1k7rc6YHkiDgD8.jpg","credit_id":"5f84b6ef69eb90003bc1cb04","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2813093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jia Kai","original_name":"Jia Kai","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f84b78939549a0037630431","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":1591,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jxShKkQtoJnAcdxIsmwThweOagC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"IDF West Lake Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2020-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
