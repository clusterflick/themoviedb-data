Major John Frost arrives a month early and heâ€™s happy to be home for Christmas. He finds his wife, Jill and son Jimmy too busy to give him the welcome he anticipated and in his absence, they have adopted a dog - a little dog named Charlie. John finds solace with the fellow vets at the Moose Lodge until Charlie finds Hank, a retired Vietnam vet, homeless and having suffered a heart attack.
