Songs (wosi) are also an important part of Trobriand music, and although everyone may compose and sing, people with special talents are encouraged to develop their skills. A range of songs are filmed and translated here: gardening and sailing songs, kula trading songs, songs of love and enticement, of grief and mourning. The film also reveals glimpses of everyday and ritual life: villages, gardens (and their magic), exchange, harvest dances, children in the rain.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/bdmkZk1flJD7IFP5We4eyZiKhGm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1971-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kama Wosi: Music in the Trobriand Islands","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2813793,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Les McLaren","original_name":"Les McLaren","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f85678923bcf400371cfb0c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":945,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bdmkZk1flJD7IFP5We4eyZiKhGm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":661}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
