It's a point of uncertainty for a country on the brink of democracy but mostly, for Boipelo who will be attending a multiracial school soon. While the normal house chores and the predictable clashes with her two annoying cousins continue, her grandfather's violent coughing coming from the bedroom and conversations amongst adults signal some sort of end that she can't grapple with. Boipelo becomes consumed by the fact that she can no longer remember her dreams when her granny, like clockwork, asks her to tell her what her dreams are in order for her to play a local Chinese lottery called Mochaena/Fahfee. As the holidays draw to a close, Boipelo devises a plan so that she can dream again and bring a smile to her forlorn grandmother's face and, perhaps, have one last feeling of belonging before her life changes forever.","popularity":0.119,"poster_path":"/8BDthsHF1WqhZTQayEU91yAwISo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2020-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tswana","iso_639_1":"tn","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What Did You Dream?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1181397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Connie Chiume","original_name":"Connie Chiume","popularity":0.3013,"profile_path":"/3ET4rE2aAEyczhognWWi1rPAdWo.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Koko","credit_id":"5f83bd8b175051003998d224","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2812184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lethabo Mpoko","original_name":"Lethabo Mpoko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Boipelo","credit_id":"5f83bd9c8258fc00379fa7b6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2812185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karabo Maleka","original_name":"Karabo Maleka","popularity":0.0671,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Tebogo","credit_id":"5f83bdac798e060038cb6944","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2812186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tshegofatso Phalafala","original_name":"Tshegofatso Phalafala","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Tumi","credit_id":"5f83bdba33ec26003847d9a7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2812187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lerato Sekele","original_name":"Lerato Sekele","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Moipone","credit_id":"5f83bdc86082eb0035e80382","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2812188,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karabo Lediga","original_name":"Karabo Lediga","popularity":0.0998,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f83bdda8258fc0034a0b18d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2812188,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karabo Lediga","original_name":"Karabo Lediga","popularity":0.0998,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f83bde36082eb0038ea6dc8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2812189,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Luke Henkeman","original_name":"Luke Henkeman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f83be03798e060038cb69f9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2155577,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lesedi Siswana","original_name":"Lesedi Siswana","popularity":0.0996,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f83be131065d30036dddaf0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2549884,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Melissa Parry","original_name":"Melissa Parry","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/4jb999vXfbgd45LCQW7nx2nxfXx.jpg","credit_id":"5f83be3f17505100389bb6af","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2812191,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Lungile Cindi","original_name":"Lungile Cindi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f83be4c798e060037cbd1bc","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2812192,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Ellaine Ngubeni","original_name":"Ellaine Ngubeni","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f83be6155c1f40036f1ea19","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2812193,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Papi Moshodi","original_name":"Papi Moshodi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f83be6d798e060036cc35e7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2812194,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"W.P.
