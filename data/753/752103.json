Starting with images of my deceased husband, I embark in a journey into memory, filming my mother and my places of childhood, recollecting my father’s memory and filming Beirut’s historical strata and the city’s alienating present. Interweaving intimate and public spaces and times, past and present, I wonder if by preserving traces through cinema I could find consolation to loss.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/yUt3sDYqbDy5t5bITYXFwSF5Zem.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"}],"release_date":"2017-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reine Mitri","original_name":"Reine Mitri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5f8229e51065d30034d16964","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1690098,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ayman Nahle","original_name":"Ayman Nahle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8229c1175051003793d368","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reine Mitri","original_name":"Reine Mitri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f82298341465c0035109016","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1690098,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ayman Nahle","original_name":"Ayman Nahle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8229b22667780036ba9be5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2537724,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Raed Younane","original_name":"Raed Younane","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8229a302842000360dc195","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reine Mitri","original_name":"Reine Mitri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f82299095c0af003677e616","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reine Mitri","original_name":"Reine Mitri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8229cffa27f4003bd641a4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yUt3sDYqbDy5t5bITYXFwSF5Zem.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Arabic\", \"english_name\"=>\"Arabic\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"ar\", \"native_name\"=>\"Arabic\"}","note":"","release_date":"2017-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
