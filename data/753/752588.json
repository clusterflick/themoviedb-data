In simple installations, in the middle of the jungle, the sertanista José Carlos Meirelles carries out the difficult mission of protecting the isolated Indians of the region, with the help of anthropologist Terri Aquino. With few resources, specialists perform their tasks tirelessly. In addition to carrying out a permanent negotiation with the riverside populations in the area, they also deal with the confrontation with traffickers and squatters who try to invade it.","popularity":0.3126,"poster_path":"/Ae4hxOm2EhaomgMzOypREPENWw8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2012-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paralelo 10","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3081109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Carlos Meirelles","original_name":"José Carlos Meirelles","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"himself","credit_id":"609402b45f4b7300405b3de3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1509517,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sílvio Da-Rin","original_name":"Sílvio Da-Rin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/qfD6s6eebFLG0ETUsyPn4JBjUWR.jpg","credit_id":"60992f28006eee003d1c8966","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1509517,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sílvio Da-Rin","original_name":"Sílvio Da-Rin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/qfD6s6eebFLG0ETUsyPn4JBjUWR.jpg","credit_id":"60992f1405a533003b292365","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1695771,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dante Belluti","original_name":"Dante Belluti","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609402c57646fd005712484e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1688065,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Edson Secco","original_name":"Edson Secco","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609402d03f8ede007862787e","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1379076,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joana Collier","original_name":"Joana Collier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609402dc3fe797004069d95b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1509517,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sílvio Da-Rin","original_name":"Sílvio Da-Rin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/qfD6s6eebFLG0ETUsyPn4JBjUWR.jpg","credit_id":"5f84674839549a00376208ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2200926","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":1674,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Ae4hxOm2EhaomgMzOypREPENWw8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1192}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1551,"name":"indigenous"},{"id":10983,"name":"anthropology"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Paralelo 10 - Trailer Oficial","key":"T2XmlV205As","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2012-04-14T05:00:46.000Z","id":"60992eed8ee49c00407492f0"}]}}}
