Five years after graduation from university, the main characters return to see themselves from the side and try to catch what is happening between the frames. The story is told by ex-students while they are watching behind-the-scenes archives of their student performance The Cabaret and reflecting upon the years that have passed. In the center of the story stands a teacher as a life-turning figure for each of the characters.","popularity":0.1321,"poster_path":"/zonmytIUkk8sNBX0o5VPidqC6wI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117001,"logo_path":"/tLhSGNNKX4VwCNbvPMissO3ea5j.png","name":"Babylon'13","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2020-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Between the Frames","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1203756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taras Denysenko","original_name":"Taras Denysenko","popularity":0.1201,"profile_path":"/y2srhHoNCQaNzqou6aOV2JYQkXz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"self","credit_id":"5f81f6771065d30036d6dc40","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2412649,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Illya Yehorov","original_name":"Illya Yehorov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/lGt50ZbZ55p5hkvOpFspGLQY1K8.jpg","credit_id":"655dc0f6d399e600af8c532e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2171828,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrii Nidzelskyi","original_name":"Andrii Nidzelskyi","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655dc1f0fab3fa00e1407a45","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1640026,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anton Baibakov","original_name":"Антон Байбаков","popularity":0.1704,"profile_path":"/jQuYDwWQVov8thY7xlBtWTg86Wj.jpg","credit_id":"655dc226629b2c013bb0d67a","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3160659,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dmytro Nesterov","original_name":"Dmytro Nesterov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655dc4e77f2d4a010b97f54c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3665331,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrii Kotliar","original_name":"Andrii Kotliar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/kGn99mYYWRPddZPiVh0TPtsS6Zb.jpg","credit_id":"655dc536e942ee00c483f8cd","department":"Writing","job":"Creative Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4390717,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mykola Bazanov","original_name":"Mykola Bazanov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655dc569e942ee00ac8a2e20","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4390721,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Oleksandr Beskrestnov","original_name":"Oleksandr Beskrestnov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655dc59afab3fa00c4736c4e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3358834,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bogdana Semen","original_name":"Bogdana Semen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655dc5ec629b2c013bb0d8e1","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2810707,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anastiasiya Tykha","original_name":"Anastiasiya Tykha","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/jTVNK5UIO1XLtonNL75t30FReOu.jpg","credit_id":"5f81f6886082eb0035e41c74","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13132442","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"pomizhkadramy","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jHs9pfhQJNPqN6DppPQpytjxcdV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yFhHPSIvqenShpImKWSnk9AXIRa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1861,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/zonmytIUkk8sNBX0o5VPidqC6wI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1257}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Ukrainian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Ukrainian\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"uk\", \"native_name\"=>\"Ukrainian\"}","note":"OIFF","release_date":"2020-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
