It’s his escape, his identity, and his legacy. But over the course of his 45 years in the mountains, he’s seen many things change: more extreme weather, fewer snow days, and economic strain on mountain towns.  Motivated by an urge to protect the places he loves, Jeremy sets out on a physical and philosophical journey to find common ground with fellow outdoor people across diverse political backgrounds. He learns their hopes and fears while walking a mile in their shoes on the mountain and in the snow.  With intimacy and emotion set against breathtaking backdrops, Purple Mountains navigates America’s divide with a refreshing perspective: even though we may disagree about climate policy, our shared values can unite us","popularity":0.599,"poster_path":"/l4PePFPgzKpw68wHDE3GsydXlR5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11117,"logo_path":"/vkZJsXBKKfHZVLMDxuMktZXNmyA.png","name":"Teton Gravity Research","origin_country":"US"},{"id":143055,"logo_path":null,"name":"Liars and Thieves","origin_country":""},{"id":143056,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sound Off Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One man's journey to find common ground in the mountains — one voter at a time.","title":"Purple Mountains","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Jones","original_name":"Jeremy Jones","popularity":0.2128,"profile_path":"/lLSa6XXc0Tdn8JyKx9aRYXO411I.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fa0d255c390c50034356b06","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2841717,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Weston Walker","original_name":"Weston Walker","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61773b2bf85958002a47f53f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1155531,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"William Ryan Fritch","original_name":"William Ryan Fritch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61773b59cf4b8b008a72720a","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2386802,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josh Murphy","original_name":"Josh Murphy","popularity":0.0754,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa0d2a3c616ac00368e45a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2841702,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joel Bourne","original_name":"Joel Bourne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa0d2bccb6db500362e391e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2841709,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adrienne Hall","original_name":"Adrienne Hall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa0d4adc616ac00368e49c1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1973119,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Collin Kriner","original_name":"Collin Kriner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa0d5c92cff1800386ef044","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Jones","original_name":"Jeremy Jones","popularity":0.2128,"profile_path":"/lLSa6XXc0Tdn8JyKx9aRYXO411I.jpg","credit_id":"5fa0d66a3a9650003aac691a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13141582","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5m3VpnTGUvmlURgEYhA2zPLBNa4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/npg9w1KLqvRvmLmhNg7F8Sb2Mvh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1406,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iVSC3deBkOGR7KoB5g2mc9FRzux.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2500},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7UvsmQGltiQTWj4RaAYmW26xHlH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/l4PePFPgzKpw68wHDE3GsydXlR5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kajywJcddUNLAfeE63JPlyvQ99.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6085,"name":"election campaign"},{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":2210,"name":"climate change"},{"id":3522,"name":"snowboarding"},{"id":159558,"name":"snow skiing"},{"id":226462,"name":"ski snowboard"},{"id":230480,"name":"usa election"},{"id":242898,"name":"alpine skiing"},{"id":248915,"name":"skiing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Purple Mountains - Official Trailer","key":"SnsfmORIY-c","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2020-09-08T13:12:11.000Z","id":"5fa0d6b0f48e0d0038ebb0e3"}]}}}
