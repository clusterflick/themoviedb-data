The image shocked and alerted the world to the refugee crisis. The film imagines what would have happened to this child until the day of his death, when the boat in which he was with a family heading to Greece turned on the high seas. The story arises from a moment of magical realism, in which Aylan's spirit emerges from his body and wanders back to the world of refugees and those provoked by war, who escape to escape for a better life.","popularity":0.2345,"poster_path":"/qFhZcYkuTMxZdfGNFeKMG1xiyt8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2440,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mij Film
