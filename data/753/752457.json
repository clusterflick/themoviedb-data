As the film unfurls, they find answers all around them; in the stunning landscapes, the culture, the history, political strife, terrible tragedies, their family homes, and their friendship. Weaved with the poetry of Cheney-Coker and Osundare, The Poets is an exploration of how art is shaped by life experiences, and of the power and urgency of art in the face of political adversity.","popularity":0.1222,"poster_path":"/aWpetKFt7uw38u7COnE6zMIafdQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Poets","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5225893,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Syl Cheney-Coker","original_name":"Syl Cheney-Coker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67a279f028a1076d089fbde6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5225894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niyi Osundare","original_name":"Niyi Osundare","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67a279fb28a1076d089fbdf6","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2974029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chivas DeVinck","original_name":"Chivas DeVinck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6025921a6a3448003f13fe00","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2974029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chivas DeVinck","original_name":"Chivas DeVinck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a2796a28a1076d089fbdae","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1425035,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Matthieu Laclau","original_name":"Matthieu Laclau","popularity":0.2937,"profile_path":"/uJrbn70TJyMfRXDBoKkA4YhzZcJ.jpg","credit_id":"67a2797a4fcf6595cc8a5fef","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3919417,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Félicia Atkinson","original_name":"Félicia Atkinson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a2798944d6863b748a5fc7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3698771,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Yann-Shan Tsai","original_name":"Yann-Shan Tsai","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a279cf28a1076d089fbdcf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6905776","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2143,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aWpetKFt7uw38u7COnE6zMIafdQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Mannheim-Heidelberg International Filmfestival","release_date":"2017-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"THE POETS Trailer","key":"okqpeW6dhUs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2018-06-12T17:21:07.000Z","id":"602592509979d2003ee6e41e"}]}}}
