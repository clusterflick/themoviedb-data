From evolution to technical progress, this family of aircraft has established itself as one of the most resounding successes of the global aeronautical industry.  From the Mirage III to the 2000, this program presents most of the aircraft in the series. It is made up exclusively of rare images, mostly in color, and we must admit that this selection of films from different eras has many advantages. Rare or poorly distributed images, we find the first flights of the first Mirage at Melun-Villaroche, that of the Mirage IV , the take-offs of the Balzac , the Mirage F1 , the unique prototype Mirage 4000 in demonstration and of course the Mirage 2000 in its element.  But as these planes were born from an industrial logic, the Ouragan , Mystère IV and other Etendards were not forgotten to finally arrive at the Rafale A that we see during its approach tests on the Clemenceau.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/jE0xYbwQaHAK5Yre9awokBd7MZ3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"50 years of Mirage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2300111,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stéphane Cohen","original_name":"Stéphane Cohen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f82370d41465c0038132850","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":993,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/jE0xYbwQaHAK5Yre9awokBd7MZ3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":662}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
