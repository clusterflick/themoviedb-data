Tapio (57), Toni (42) and Aksa (60) are also stuck on these tracks. The men meet every morning in the square behind the Herttoniemi metro station, from where they transfer to Vuosaari in the metro's \"restaurant car\". Men's lives are dominated by alcohol and unemployment. The turning track of dreams follows the lives of Tapio, Toni and Aksa for a year - moments filled with joy, despair, self-destruction and friendship in the metro stations and trains of Eastern Helsinki. It gives voice to those who do not have special human dignity in the eyes of society.","popularity":0.3387,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2022-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Haaveiden kääntöraide","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1031196,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jari Kokko","original_name":"Jari Kokko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638271e82e0697023d274a73","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3803783,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Janne Koivula","original_name":"Janne Koivula","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638271bdb3316b00aff4877f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1787,"name":"helsinki, finland"},{"id":7464,"name":"alcoholism"},{"id":163080,"name":"finland"},{"id":288061,"name":"metro"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kettupäivät Film Festival Helsinki","release_date":"2022-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TEASER HAAVEIDEN KAANTORAIDE HD","key":"NHboRYLV2aw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2019-06-12T11:47:39.000Z","id":"63827264eec5b50086ac1034"}]}}}
