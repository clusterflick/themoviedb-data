She describes her father's involvement in World War II and uncovers a legacy of discrimination and racism against British Columbia's Chinese-Canadian community. Sworn to secrecy for decades, Osborne's father and his war buddies now vividly recall their top-secret missions behind enemy lines in Southeast Asia. Theirs is a tale of young men proudly fighting for a country that had mistreated them. This film does more than reveal an important period in Canadian history. It pays moving tribute to a father's quiet heroism.","popularity":0.0578,"poster_path":"/mSu8qj0amOIfiQSboPUnUE6jG1K.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1999-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unwanted Soldiers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Soldats de seconde classe","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3803567,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Mah","original_name":"Roy Mah","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"63823bc9f04d0100c8d36ee2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3803569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Chin","original_name":"Lee Chin","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"63823bdeb3316b00aff476c0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3803571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Ko Bong","original_name":"John Ko Bong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"63823c8c1b157d00b785d52c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3803572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Douglas Jung","original_name":"Douglas Jung","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"63823c95b3316b0096b36ba9","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3803591,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jim Ursulak","original_name":"Jim Ursulak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63823e53f04d0100b7b6a9ee","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486904,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Karen King-Chigbo","original_name":"Karen King-Chigbo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63823d14229ae215542767e7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3803593,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Guy Zerafa","original_name":"Guy Zerafa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63823e602e0697026e9fb738","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3803578,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Louise Lore","original_name":"Louise Lore","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63823d67fb834600876f8a2a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3803582,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Michael Grippo","original_name":"Michael Grippo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63823de8229ae21572a877ad","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3803587,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Steve Weslak","original_name":"Steve Weslak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63823e21229ae2155427684e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3803573,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jari Osborne","original_name":"Jari Osborne","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63823ccb229ae21572a87751","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0442854","wikidata_id":"Q7897812","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mSu8qj0amOIfiQSboPUnUE6jG1K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1999-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
