That generosity triggers horrific retaliation by the Japanese that claims an estimated quarter-million lives and prompts comparisons to the 1937-38 Rape of Nanking. The memory of the Raiders and their rescuers is kept alive by their children and grandchildren.","popularity":0.4139,"poster_path":"/9XTDVlh54Kj0LFqAY0W3odLlUl2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26277,"logo_path":"/uXqiWcZbtSG2G9cQ031fRl2V0gH.png","name":"American Public Television","origin_country":"US"},{"id":187105,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paradox Communications","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unsettled History: America, China, and the Doolittle Tokyo Raid","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2900627,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Einreinhofer","original_name":"Bill Einreinhofer","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/nAE6Zup0nEUBdZzVJAjHVNUyipL.jpg","credit_id":"6382aed0229ae21597d32414","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2900627,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Einreinhofer","original_name":"Bill Einreinhofer","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/nAE6Zup0nEUBdZzVJAjHVNUyipL.jpg","credit_id":"6382ae7efb834600995fdfbc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18351196","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pf5ausrzvULtTZtuU6miM08ZvpN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9XTDVlh54Kj0LFqAY0W3odLlUl2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":10168,"name":"aviation"},{"id":221689,"name":"military history"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"Unsettled History: America, China and the Doolittle Tokyo Raid\" (national promo)","key":"687156615","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-03-11T15:18:06.000Z","id":"6382aff81b157d00b785f594"}]}}}
