This is all the more shocking since another bad review from Stalin’s totalitarian forces could have meant a sentence to the Gulag or worse.... When he penned this fifth symphony, the composer was literally writing for his life. The risk was so high that Shostakovich slept on the stairs outside his apartment so the secret police would not wake his family when they came from him, as he was sure they would. This Keeping Score episode, investigates the arresting symphony that would either redeem Shostakovich or doom him. Did he dare hide a kernel of musical criticism in what appears to be a paean to the Motherland? Join Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony as they explore the hidden language of this masterwork. Episode includes full-length concert performance of Dimitri Shostakovich’s Symphony No. 5 in D minor by the San Francisco Symphony.","popularity":0.1612,"poster_path":"/77ZQXFCcpqa9FC2JfSiG8SVk8Pq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Keeping Score: Shostakovich Symphony No. 5","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1023499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Tilson Thomas","original_name":"Michael Tilson Thomas","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/3TaEyZ02YbEeBDTvXX0PkfYysls.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6381f7a72e0697024d299cbe","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2922348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"San Francisco Symphony","original_name":"San Francisco Symphony","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/yPZ1S0brfGyS6Xmi17eVAP8d02E.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6381f7b9a410c800a432916b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":103414,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Kennard","original_name":"David Kennard","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6381f7eb229ae2158115dd26","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2434552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joan Saffa","original_name":"Joan Saffa","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6381f80fa4af8f00ca0af9cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/remp3z3tAbsfjINw6g6JqhVcjp8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/77ZQXFCcpqa9FC2JfSiG8SVk8Pq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1061}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
