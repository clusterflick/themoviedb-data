Anthony Milo is the strongest and fastest sprinter at New York City's Gonzaga College, whose 4 x 400 meter relay team is on their way to winning a national championship title. What do these two men have in common? In both of their stories they are destined to race towards death to let their true spirits live. THE ANCHOR MAN is the story of strength reborn into the heart of a young man, whose convictions lead him on a journey from the explosion of the starting gun to an explosion of artistic expression.","popularity":0.1973,"poster_path":"/hWyxwRsoB46Vh7o5Y9arFY44gBn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Anchor Man","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3803774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zachary Diggs","original_name":"Zachary Diggs","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"David Lincoln","credit_id":"63826b47a4af8f0086624c29","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1920707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marlon John","original_name":"Marlon John","popularity":0.2767,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Anthony Milo","credit_id":"63826b67229ae215542775e9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3803775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jabbar E.
