This episode considers the politics implicit in Public Enemy’s claim that we’re already living [in] armaged-don. It begins with the discovery of an ancient stone crosshairs at an archeological site in Egypt. Sixty years later a giant alien mothership emerges from a mena-cing cloud over New York City, hijacking President Ron-ald Reagan’s TV statement in order to transmit a pirate broadcast from Chuck D, Flavor Flav and Sun Ra. Like Sun Ra’s mantra that ‘it’s after the end of the world’, Public Enemy invoke armageddon to insist upon the critical moment in which we already live.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/iXqoZ6bozX2vJzWDt9vMdei05Dz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Astro Black: Armageddon in Effect","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1397518,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Soda Jerk","original_name":"Soda Jerk","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b9a983fa4046008755331d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9039472","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.757,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iXqoZ6bozX2vJzWDt9vMdei05Dz.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":568}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
