Live footage of the self-proclaimed “desk metal” quartet is interspersed with baffling but authentic footage of a Japanese junior high school class in which the students are being instructed on the subject of... Faxed Head! In addition to the electronics- and mayhem-heavy 1995 Osaka set, the DVD includes bonus live footage of a reconstituted (and much more metal-sounding) Faxed Head on tour in Canada in 2001. And, for the true fan, a 45-minute long hidden \"Easter egg\" showcases an entire concert by Faxed Head's long-time nemesis, pitiful Coalinga-area boogie-blues idiots The Bon Larvis Band.","popularity":0.1491,"poster_path":"/oK8MDmyEE4vWBWxrpnWyisgpIuj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134349,"logo_path":null,"name":"Web of Mimicry","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2008-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Faxed Head: From Coalinga to Osaka (Live in Japan 1995)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1224999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gregg Turkington","original_name":"Gregg Turkington","popularity":0.354,"profile_path":"/bjOZYkDXbVGSw8B6NHamYlDSBPB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"McPatrick Head","credit_id":"6382c1222e06970292e378ee","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3804079,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandan Kearney","original_name":"Brandan Kearney","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Jigsaw Puzzle Head","credit_id":"6382c13af04d0100b7b6d517","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3804080,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Franklin","original_name":"Phil Franklin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"LaBrea Tar Pits Head","credit_id":"6382c154eec5b50098d10aeb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3804081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Goode","original_name":"James Goode","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Fifth Head","credit_id":"6382c174229ae21581161fad","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":236107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trey Spruance","original_name":"Trey Spruance","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Neck Head","credit_id":"6382c18ba410c800a432d304","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":1518,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oK8MDmyEE4vWBWxrpnWyisgpIuj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
