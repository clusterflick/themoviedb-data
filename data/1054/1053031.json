Eason, are chosen to infiltrate the Ploesti oil field in order to set signal fires to guide Allied bombers to Germany's most closely guarded target of the war. When landing in Roumania, they are supposed to be met by a partisan as their guide, but he has been killed by an Allied air-raid, and they are met instead by his daughter Nitza, who is very hostile to the Americans as she blames them for the death of her father. As they make their way to the oil field, Nitza and Manjack fall in love. He is killed in a skirmish with German troops and, as a dying wish, asks Nitza to continue with the group and help them with their mission. She does, the signal fires are set and Ploesti is destroyed.","popularity":0.1024,"poster_path":"/qJn4e8OKEZDqciQsU6rFRemdCNS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1960-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heroes Die Young","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Os heróis morrem jovens","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Les héros meurent jeunes","type":"French title"},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Sankarit kuolevat nuorena","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Les Héros meurent jeunes","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"I efodos ton kommandos","type":"transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Ora zero: missione morte","type":"Poster title"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"誇り高き海兵隊","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Keinen Pfifferling für Stoßtrupp Z","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":103737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erika Peters","original_name":"Erika Peters","popularity":0.1068,"profile_path":"/zT69J6951Kll8l5DJRn83Gqyu8G.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Nitza","credit_id":"637feec76e938a008716b9c0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1043980,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Scott Borland","original_name":"Scott Borland","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Manjack","credit_id":"6380888e514c4a007f5c4b32","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3801977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Getz","original_name":"Robert Getz","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Hoofer","credit_id":"638088be514c4a00845a143a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Browne","original_name":"Roger Browne","popularity":0.2336,"profile_path":"/uCPBoKih2RQDmPn9oN5htdoMz7B.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"64b57fc537806200c58829fa","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1127183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malcolm Smith","original_name":"Malcolm Smith","popularity":0.1175,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"64b57fce0e4fc851a0f47d3e","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3801432,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gerald Shepard","original_name":"Gerald Shepard","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"637fee82514c4a008459dd4b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3801993,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Russ irwin","original_name":"Russ irwin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63808a15a410c8008481d61a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3801989,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Al Pellegrini","original_name":"Al Pellegrini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638089e3a410c800c88458b4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3801983,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Al Pellegrini","original_name":"Al Pellegrini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6380896da4af8f0086616275","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3801432,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gerald Shepard","original_name":"Gerald Shepard","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63808a716e938a008404c52c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3801996,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Franck Russel","original_name":"Franck Russel","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63808a2d514c4a009999485a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3801432,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gerald Shepard","original_name":"Gerald Shepard","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63808a44a4af8f00866162da","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119502,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Henry DeMond","original_name":"Henry DeMond","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b57efd12197e00c5f4b660","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0220513","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":786,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qJn4e8OKEZDqciQsU6rFRemdCNS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":524}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1960-05-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
