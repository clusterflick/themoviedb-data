Destination Planet Rock maps the intergalactic legacy of Sun Ra and George Clinton in the sci-fi futurism of early hip-hop. Set in 1974 in the South Bronx, the episode be-gins in a neighborhood center where Sun Ra is explain-ing his ideas about the intersection of race, myth and outer space. The three future originators of hip-hop—DJ Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa, and Grandmaster Flash—are abducted and transported across the galaxy to Planet Rock, where they are schooled in the alien language of turntablism.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/l5zF1qhza2ClYHxbTBYLYjlZD1M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Astro Black: Destination Planet Rock","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1397518,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Soda Jerk","original_name":"Soda Jerk","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b9a939fa404600c1279af0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9039506","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.756,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l5zF1qhza2ClYHxbTBYLYjlZD1M.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":567}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Soda Jerk - Astro Black: Destination Planet Rock, 2007","key":"84899627","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2014-01-23T21:02:11.000Z","id":"63b9a965ae6f0900807b78a8"}]}}}
