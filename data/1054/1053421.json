music.","popularity":0.3315,"poster_path":"/5QHkO7R48QVKfoVI1p5ebrH1of4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128729,"logo_path":"/nsFlJw9R4yq5YRFr0cIQ6uxPlUS.png","name":"3B-Produktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":95576,"logo_path":"/r3aDiyT6jM3ORrc5YaSH1600Ozk.png","name":"DW","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2022-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Music
