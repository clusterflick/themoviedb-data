Pic tells the story of a group of miners living in a camp in outback Australia. They swear, brawl, gamble, and drink heavily. Central to the story is the conflict between Tarzan, the authoritarian group leader and cocky loud-mouth wisecracking Pansy. This results in a bare-knuckle punch-up for the movie's denouement.","popularity":1.1587,"poster_path":"/ifp0RelJ36dvC76OeNjNbEvNgM5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1979-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"He'll try to keep the roof on!","title":"The Last of the Knucklemen","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerard Kennedy","original_name":"Gerard Kennedy","popularity":2.2861,"profile_path":"/y7hlnxY3qM1WKt7Yu0U7jsi1074.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tarzan","credit_id":"53da0f7bc3a3681ecd0012dd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Preston","original_name":"Michael Preston","popularity":0.3561,"profile_path":"/kcfNCp4uXqKhlqcfWrwfTalA5Gz.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Pansy","credit_id":"53da0f84c3a3681eee001211","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":75716,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Hehir","original_name":"Peter Hehir","popularity":0.3414,"profile_path":"/2QuwPcH9bscv3uUcIwMvIBk6lLX.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Tom","credit_id":"53da0f8dc3a3681eea0010fa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1233003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Miller","original_name":"Dennis Miller","popularity":0.1808,"profile_path":"/iIku9C1iBfDRoh357C8NuyO1B8b.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Horse","credit_id":"5c8f11e80e0a2612fc57c194","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":75889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Caton","original_name":"Michael Caton","popularity":0.3069,"profile_path":"/8V9uSF00fv8AHt51I0hwFDKAYDT.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Monk","credit_id":"572b1bc9c3a368121a0009d0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":954286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Rackman","original_name":"Steve Rackman","popularity":0.0946,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Carl","credit_id":"572b1bd692514106f70020ff","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1855840,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Duffield","original_name":"Michael Duffield","popularity":0.1431,"profile_path":"/fuPb0AHPsI1eZhoVc9TjTnPDiQf.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Methuselah","credit_id":"5c8f12d09251410feda2fcd9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Bisley","original_name":"Steve Bisley","popularity":0.4209,"profile_path":"/9KE407G6yIItUDlduj9MWAz392o.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Mad Dog","credit_id":"572b1bef925141716e00118a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stewart Faichney","original_name":"Stewart Faichney","popularity":0.0682,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Tassie","credit_id":"572b1bffc3a3684801002067","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerry Duggan","original_name":"Gerry Duggan","popularity":0.1053,"profile_path":"/eRoRqlUSypkh49elIiryUlT9dGs.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Old Arthur","credit_id":"572b1c159251417e0b0010ea","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109997,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Burstall","original_name":"Tim Burstall","popularity":0.1161,"profile_path":"/7etYr2co2uGfX9nW2hwudVQ1pY7.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49dfc3a368484e144d61","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94007,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Power","original_name":"John Power","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/gEe7i58zhfusoO0n0u9ZMvSHQos.jpg","credit_id":"572b1ba7c3a368480d002193","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109997,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Burstall","original_name":"Tim Burstall","popularity":0.1161,"profile_path":"/7etYr2co2uGfX9nW2hwudVQ1pY7.jpg","credit_id":"572b1bb2c3a36854a300125a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0079444","wikidata_id":"Q7746251","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nXVA2bJJPjJpfmDE6KHNU5HeN2N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ifp0RelJ36dvC76OeNjNbEvNgM5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Last of the Knucklemen -
