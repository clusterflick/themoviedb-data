Eight years have passed since the events of Au Pair, and newly graduated as his high school's valedictorian, Alexander Caldwell joins his visiting sister, college freshman Katie and her roommate Ariana on a family summer vacation with father Oliver and stepmother Jenny.

Amidst corporate scheming by the young company CFO Walter Hausen, who is planning a takeover of Oliver's company CCI Tekhausen (formed in Au Pair II), Oliver and Jenny must contend with bridging the generation gap with the family, new career motivations and the romances of their 'newly reformed' prankster kids.","popularity":1.5485,"poster_path":"/1qpY1O4eUWesxO7z6ZF5P4SiKkq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Au Pair 3: Adventure in Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":15,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Au Pair 3: Aventuras en el Paraíso","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Au Pair III - Adventure in Paradise","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gregory Harrison","original_name":"Gregory Harrison","popularity":0.7243,"profile_path":"/jAM849EA6rE8N6Ma6i9Ne9qw8gN.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Oliver Caldwell","credit_id":"5970a414c3a3687162023afc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":106485,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heidi Lenhart","original_name":"Heidi Lenhart","popularity":0.2072,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Jenny Morgan Caldwell","credit_id":"5cbd8cba0e0a266b27ec4713","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":114020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katie Volding","original_name":"Katie Volding","popularity":0.1914,"profile_path":"/uC6CM3rTngF7czzqzb7hheyU6un.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Katie Caldwell","credit_id":"5cbd8cd1c3a368092a807068","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":154611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jake Dinwiddie","original_name":"Jake Dinwiddie","popularity":0.172,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Alex Caldwell","credit_id":"52fe49e3c3a368484e14588d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2294335,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathleen Mealia","original_name":"Kathleen Mealia","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Ariana","credit_id":"5cbd8cf6c3a368092a8070c3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2294336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ciaran Tyrrell","original_name":"Ciaran Tyrrell","popularity":0.0755,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Danny Taylor","credit_id":"5cbd8d140e0a266b96f8f6f8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":53937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Merediz","original_name":"Olga Merediz","popularity":0.4628,"profile_path":"/AoU4DdgK26xQN4qZTuzgJpVxhos.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Teresa","credit_id":"5cbd8d280e0a26105af2d383","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":168377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bradley White","original_name":"Bradley White","popularity":0.344,"profile_path":"/2w964FOSrUJ2mCXihWC4qTm7i86.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Walter Hausen","credit_id":"5cbd8d5a0e0a266b96f8f79e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":64318,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rafa Alvarez","original_name":"Rafa Alvarez","popularity":0.0984,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Boyguard II","credit_id":"52fe49e3c3a368484e145885","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":587927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessenia Da Silva ","original_name":"Jessenia Da Silva ","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Baby sitter","credit_id":"52fe49e3c3a368484e145889","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Griffiths","original_name":"Mark Griffiths","popularity":0.2287,"profile_path":"/7SYLsQvO9ZO7gGbbLmiT8AjrrsY.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49e3c3a368484e145881","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1844580,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zoraida Sanjurjo López","original_name":"Zoraida Sanjurjo López","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":"/vll73ODKg6QufbQhNZYiukdiMjq.jpg","credit_id":"6386bddc229ae21572aa3d3b","department":"Production","job":"Casting Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1621832,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"John Gilbert","original_name":"John Gilbert","popularity":0.1958,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6386d530229ae21597d51508","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2993855,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jeff C.
