Star of hit TV shows 8 Out of 10 Cats and 10 O’clock Live, Jimmy is well known for his slick one liners and non-stop gags, but his acerbic wit and fast-paced comedy style are at their brilliant best when he has the stage to himself. Packed with over 100 minutes of brand new material, including too-rude-for-TV jokes, hilarious heckling, and even better put-downs, Jimmy pushes the boundaries of comedy and delivers a spectacular show.","popularity":0.609,"poster_path":"/pgReAIU7fPxohFIu4aoe3g5nOkx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3625,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bwark Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jimmy Carr: Being Funny","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":41,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Jimmy Carr: Being Funny","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Jimmy Carr - Being Funny","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Carr","original_name":"Jimmy Carr","popularity":0.5526,"profile_path":"/xfEer8eO6rUrpuctvMrJtseYJcR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe49d5c3a368484e14260d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84740,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Iain Morris","original_name":"Iain Morris","popularity":0.1104,"profile_path":"/pZRZtAlE6GiMDMhVmM7n3TKm2sR.jpg","credit_id":"52fe49d5c3a368484e142619","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84742,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sam Pinnell","original_name":"Sam Pinnell","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49d5c3a368484e142613","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66124,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Wheeler","original_name":"Paul Wheeler","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49d5c3a368484e142625","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84739,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Damon Beesley","original_name":"Damon Beesley","popularity":0.0887,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49d5c3a368484e14261f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087123,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Nolan","original_name":"Steve Nolan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/kOkBvPHPuSfTcY0WWTRNFJxSAkv.jpg","credit_id":"6561c5f63679a109764711fa","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1143429,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jon Blow","original_name":"Jon Blow","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b57cb758efd30163ca7d7d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Carr","original_name":"Jimmy Carr","popularity":0.5526,"profile_path":"/xfEer8eO6rUrpuctvMrJtseYJcR.jpg","credit_id":"5e503052a76ac50011a04324","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2120780","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pgReAIU7fPxohFIu4aoe3g5nOkx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9716,"name":"stand-up comedy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Socially Unacceptable | Jimmy Carr: Being Funny","key":"pQ_OA3rEdp0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2019-10-04T16:00:11.000Z","id":"5e50308da76ac50015a0a672"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Wrong special.
