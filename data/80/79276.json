Although originating before the show, they appeared in a number of brief sketches in the 1980s TV programme Saturday Live. Eventually being banned for being \"too sexy and too violent\", they staged a protest by returning as 'The Ben Elton Brothers', and blowing up the car park at LWT Studios. One of the final sketches prepared for Saturday Live was entitled 'Kinky Sex'. This fell foul of Channel 4 censors who banned it. The duo responded in the sketch Dangervision by apparently hijacking the programme and blowing up the wall on which the show's logo was painted in graffiti art. The banned sketch, which by modern standards seems fairly tame, was finally released on a compilation video The Dangerous Brothers present: World of Danger.","popularity":1.557,"poster_path":"/1cAa7rJpjh4jLHMRDIR5eKhbhHf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dangerous Brothers Present: World of Danger","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Dangervision","type":"DVD title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rik Mayall","original_name":"Rik Mayall","popularity":0.6218,"profile_path":"/aaKeDPbG40TrPV8OCN44vE9gtoa.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Richard Dangerous","credit_id":"52fe49cac3a368484e13ff25","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adrian Edmondson","original_name":"Adrian Edmondson","popularity":0.7507,"profile_path":"/btwSD67CRm3lgouhLDbVockucra.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sir Adrian Dangerous","credit_id":"52fe49cac3a368484e13ff29","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":59070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morwenna Banks","original_name":"Morwenna Banks","popularity":0.2987,"profile_path":"/oraLxvDNim7ixQEcJz9nVqgy0eT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c1f8d390e0a264ddeec07f7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Fry","original_name":"Stephen Fry","popularity":1.3403,"profile_path":"/dH7GuUZ8QPM9RN99ak9KKOkSkdS.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5c1f8d4392514167f1bff575","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugh Laurie","original_name":"Hugh Laurie","popularity":3.0662,"profile_path":"/akArncggHnusP5jxzMBKmJDRrMo.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5c1f8d4c0e0a264de6ec0fa8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":196385,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Lederer","original_name":"Helen Lederer","popularity":0.2628,"profile_path":"/weH2uSuf9nckEKkF9ya0TSNgjI1.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5c1f8d540e0a264de1ec0959","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Lovett","original_name":"Norman Lovett","popularity":0.1403,"profile_path":"/wHjejt9qJoXY4gVXrLLbtUrRaSl.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5c1f8d669251414c16bf3b7a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":12094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Saunders","original_name":"Jennifer Saunders","popularity":1.1213,"profile_path":"/pTgxwHcz9L8SNVYvPJS0o0lgHya.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5c1f8d83c3a3681c34e9f336","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1215634,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Jackson","original_name":"Paul Jackson","popularity":0.0821,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d908e36109cd00021447184","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0135086","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1cAa7rJpjh4jLHMRDIR5eKhbhHf.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/w8yJzii5N2q6uldlx27KxngfTpg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
