The documentary traces the story of changing social and religious attitudes to sex through a broad swathe of history. Starting with the place of ’sacred sex’ in the ancient world and ending with a discussion of the contemporary relationship between sex, marketing and prurience, the film offers some kind of map of how we got from there to here, and indicates that changes in sexual attitudes are connected with issues of power and control.","popularity":0.43,"poster_path":"/eKmSJUNy61sjfTYhZkbCKGM2zDb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Surprising History of Sex and Love","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terry Jones","original_name":"Terry Jones","popularity":0.48,"profile_path":"/keJpqxK8gykrrK2W6yeSeDUbYDK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe49dfc3a368484e144beb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":115297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joann Fletcher","original_name":"Joann Fletcher","popularity":0.1087,"profile_path":"/2adidLfh0JDSo5CrACJnIVOYYOA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe49dfc3a368484e144bef","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":587785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"prof.
