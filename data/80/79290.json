Born with a strong hare lip which left him disfigured and gave his voice a peculiarl nasal tone, he devoted his entire life trying to get people to laugh with him instead of at him. Ultimately, his despairing at ever becoming accepted as a fellow man coupled with unrequited love made his life tragic, culminating in his suicide at age 54. His jokes are still well known today.","popularity":0.2293,"poster_path":"/hw8EnUBUyOg9Vgbuevla3MjqvUl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1970-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dällebach Kari","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Das seltsame Leben des Karl Tellenbach","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50205,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walo Lüönd","original_name":"Walo Lüönd","popularity":0.1558,"profile_path":"/grXU7GTBbMZqTNgfR5P4cVYaK8k.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Karl Tellenbach","credit_id":"52fe49cbc3a368484e140101","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lukas Ammann","original_name":"Lukas Ammann","popularity":0.4041,"profile_path":"/zW9TnoIjP6oosqfHH9jxlcPYgWQ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Basler Nationalrat","credit_id":"52fe49cbc3a368484e140105","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":23344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annemarie Düringer","original_name":"Annemarie Düringer","popularity":0.1681,"profile_path":"/9q6RpKUbbMSPIW1ToL5D44dgGSi.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Frau Jenny","credit_id":"52fe49cbc3a368484e140109","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":12322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellen Widmann","original_name":"Ellen Widmann","popularity":0.2872,"profile_path":"/hD0FI25y5wqVkcA5kdEE3XyvztH.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Rosa Tellenbach","credit_id":"52fe49cbc3a368484e14010d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Gaugler","original_name":"Hans Gaugler","popularity":0.0909,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Stromer","credit_id":"52fe49cbc3a368484e140111","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":46764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margrit Winter","original_name":"Margrit Winter","popularity":0.0667,"profile_path":"/cy9uhIcDXeQsRGfOZ4Oank7IpnF.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Frau Geiser","credit_id":"52fe49cbc3a368484e140115","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erwin Kohlund","original_name":"Erwin Kohlund","popularity":0.116,"profile_path":"/rGYkjH873NcPnMsew7Iqu3BUoSN.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Herr Geiser","credit_id":"52fe49cbc3a368484e140119","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":586350,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kurt Früh","original_name":"Kurt Früh","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49cbc3a368484e1400fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0317305","wikidata_id":"Q1269636","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":950,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/hw8EnUBUyOg9Vgbuevla3MjqvUl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":670}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
