Hating her new life from the first moment, she thinks the other girls are stupid to prefer horses to clothes and make-up. But a dramatic encounter with a horse called Kehilan changes everything. Suddenly Ida becomes eager to learn to ride, and then she discovers that the other girls are pretty OK. But upon discovering that Kehilan is soon to be sent to the slaughterhouse, a self-centred interest in clothes and fashion seems quite meaningless. But will Ida, against all odds, manage to save her horse?","popularity":0.1813,"poster_path":"/mwyCEWaRtqhoet3pV4UWhWfFdap.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coming Home","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Sommer mit Kehilan","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Haugen Kristiansen","original_name":"Victor Haugen Kristiansen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Gustav","credit_id":"5767ef5ac3a36804f9000134","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1576785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marianne Meløy","original_name":"Marianne Meløy","popularity":0.0397,"profile_path":"/a51NdhmqoXO3LmvSAVGHieUkI0h.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lisbeth","credit_id":"5767ef71c3a36803ab000146","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elise Strømberg","original_name":"Elise Strømberg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Molly","credit_id":"5767ef969251410576000155","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julie Nordhuus","original_name":"Julie Nordhuus","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Ida","credit_id":"5767efb792514176840002b1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marthe Vonheim","original_name":"Marthe Vonheim","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Hanne","credit_id":"5767efcec3a36878e40001cf","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hanne Øberg","original_name":"Hanne Øberg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Beathe","credit_id":"5767efe6925141057600015f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":592785,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kathrine Haugen","original_name":"Kathrine Haugen","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Scénariste","credit_id":"5767f00092514110d9000068","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4050143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Pernille Marlow","original_name":"Nina Pernille Marlow","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Karoline","credit_id":"6457fc6f1b70ae00e2ab51a4","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4050144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janne Asvik","original_name":"Janne Asvik","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Emma","credit_id":"6457fc9c6aa8e000ff5a6f3b","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4050145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Kristine Vonheim","original_name":"Anne Kristine Vonheim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Kikki","credit_id":"6457fca7156cc7011eff54e2","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1356325,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anders Øvergaard","original_name":"Anders Øvergaard","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53f9b06fc3a3687355002b60","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2042695","wikidata_id":"Q12006352","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2xGktRe8j9OTGyH2qCun43WkGMP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5L7WpiOGCZLAVBSA0PZeLH6V5Q8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1092,"iso_639_1":"no","file_path":"/mwyCEWaRtqhoet3pV4UWhWfFdap.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":728},{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/8lgDlSLkUrpEnrAQkd412OO5kBE.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1417},{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/yKwwpNCJRkREDu9iMclcaovcVTF.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"6","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
