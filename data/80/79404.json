He opts to live on the streets of London. Alone in a park at night he is set upon by a gang of violent thugs, in his bid to escape he accidentally runs into a tree. In A&E Tom meets an extremely happy, fast-talking individual, Aidan, the complete opposite of Tom. Too polite, or too weak to ask him to leave him alone Tom tries to get away from him but to no avail, Aidan sticks to Tom like glue. Tom reluctantly becomes involved in Aidan's life and he quickly realizes that this child like man clearly has his own problems, except Aidan can't see them, his shiny optimism blinds him at every turn, even from his 'girlfriend' the dangerous and volatile Linda.","popularity":0.9739,"poster_path":"/vIKJxUnmzrQl6NtqjjXCLD20Lgx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2010-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Treacle Jr.","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":587115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Riann Steele","original_name":"Riann Steele","popularity":0.2577,"profile_path":"/px4glR9GEEI5pnKvXbpDrg1YY7C.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Linda","credit_id":"52fe49d1c3a368484e1417ff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aidan Gillen","original_name":"Aidan Gillen","popularity":2.2435,"profile_path":"/fWWRgyJEGjOPcx43CaFiUCWMBLo.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Aiden","credit_id":"52fe49d1c3a368484e14181b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Fisher","original_name":"Tom Fisher","popularity":0.45,"profile_path":"/oVKIxTE5zNg5KlFg2AEZ0vYs2sy.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Tom","credit_id":"53622447c3a368395d001322","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4329148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diane Axford","original_name":"Diane Axford","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Actress","credit_id":"6776d367dd179c5b35929eca","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1512272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Deren","original_name":"Rebecca Deren","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Actress","credit_id":"6781973fee84fa4def7b1f05","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83224,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jamie Thraves","original_name":"Jamie Thraves","popularity":0.1,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49d1c3a368484e141805","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83224,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jamie Thraves","original_name":"Jamie Thraves","popularity":0.1,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49d1c3a368484e14180b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83224,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jamie Thraves","original_name":"Jamie Thraves","popularity":0.1,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49d1c3a368484e141811","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":587116,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rob Small","original_name":"Rob Small","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49d1c3a368484e141817","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1542486","wikidata_id":"Q18170554","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vIKJxUnmzrQl6NtqjjXCLD20Lgx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TREACLE Jr. the Trailer","key":"nPKpq3UoEx0","published_at":"2011-05-18T13:41:32.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6cac3a36854480073ce"}]}}}
