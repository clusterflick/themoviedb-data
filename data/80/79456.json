Duke Mitchell stars as Paul, a gangster who's just been released from prison and is offered 100,000 dollars from the mafia to take out seven men. He reluctantly agrees, in order to give himself and his friends a better, clean life outside of prison, but he can't seem to leave his old ways behind, resulting in a plot to kidnap the Pope for a ransom of fifty cents from every Catholic in the world.","popularity":0.3381,"poster_path":"/y6xA1jo69QVDWx4VEgd48bDTAYR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"...you're
