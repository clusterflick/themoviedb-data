The challenges begin when Jonathan's nine–year–old daughter bounds into the bedroom very early the next morning. However, the stakes heighten when Jonathan discovers that David is his \"new client\" at the marketing firm where he is employed. Fraternizing with clients on the opposite side of the conference table is strictly prohibited by the firm, and Jonathan quickly nips things in the bud. As time progresses, love conquers all obstacles. Working against them are their different races, different countries of origin and homophobia. Oh Happy Day is that special film that brings out the true romantic hiding inside us all.","popularity":1.0741,"poster_path":"/xnt8OpZNnvOqK9mnqYWWFxFr22n.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oh Happy Day","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1221759,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Colquhoun","original_name":"Christopher Colquhoun","popularity":0.3908,"profile_path":"/x2SgJAFPe0MOuj5N7LvTE98ZaWs.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Jonathan","credit_id":"600eca89d70594003b2179c7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Billington","original_name":"Stephen Billington","popularity":0.079,"profile_path":"/zDHE0QUqzMeMJEUVKhGD5NlS315.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"David","credit_id":"52fe49ebc3a368484e1474bb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":590485,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Alexis","original_name":"Anthony Alexis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Salsa Club Barman","credit_id":"52fe49ebc3a368484e1474b7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":590486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cristina Avery","original_name":"Cristina Avery","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"'Sushi' Research Assistant","credit_id":"52fe49ebc3a368484e1474bf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":199085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seeta Indrani","original_name":"Seeta Indrani","popularity":0.2976,"profile_path":"/mt6MtcJ9ioa5O5ZMkXGxAZ6t39C.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Salsa Teacher","credit_id":"52fe49ebc3a368484e1474c3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1133185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jocelyn Osorio","original_name":"Jocelyn Osorio","popularity":0.1771,"profile_path":"/ngvBRwMQMIf9qCzFZV1FryMA3Aw.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Holly","credit_id":"52fe49ebc3a368484e1474d3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1221047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pooky Quesnel","original_name":"Pooky Quesnel","popularity":0.1964,"profile_path":"/gULckuxXu4dvOviDGQqySAKfjWL.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Fern","credit_id":"5806013a9251415b90004f74","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":184997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar James","original_name":"Oscar James","popularity":0.4153,"profile_path":"/i8S9LvbGAckdVCDmefyGGrMfcc6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Storekeeper","credit_id":"52fe49ebc3a368484e1474b3","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1230439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Jerricho","original_name":"Paul Jerricho","popularity":0.0976,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Rex","credit_id":"644bbe10336e0105417362f5","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerald Lepkowski","original_name":"Gerald Lepkowski","popularity":0.225,"profile_path":"/6LG2Ys98l6QjobTR027Xr9lxhme.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Rob","credit_id":"644bbe36726fb102fc06239e","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":590487,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Poitier","original_name":"Ian Poitier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49ebc3a368484e1474c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":590488,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ian Poitier","original_name":"Ian Poitier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe49ebc3a368484e1474cf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2330165,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrew Chapman","original_name":"Andrew Chapman","popularity":0.084,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cce514e210230162c35bff","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1059817","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gUnzBVmf3jS0sshsBCs8artuguW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xnt8OpZNnvOqK9mnqYWWFxFr22n.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":522}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":258533,"name":"gay theme"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
