Janet is an over-weight girl who has a knack for making the other children in school laugh... by making fun of her own weight. In seeing the other kids' reactions, she feels that she might have what it takes to be a comedian. She visits the local comedy club where she finds Tony Moroni who is a struggling comedian whose jokes are less than funny. Together Tony helps Janet find self-esteem and Janet helps Tony with his material.","popularity":1.0983,"poster_path":"/sj5sqGKfySuDNehhOcWt2K94Tcj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12113,"logo_path":"/lwnLVleFG0sRAYBq5IObgN30r9F.png","name":"CBC","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Comedy is not pretty.","title":"Rubberface","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":25,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Rubber Face","type":"DVD box title"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Introducing...
