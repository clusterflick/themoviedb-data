He started to play the piano at the age of two, as soon as he was tall enough to reach the keyboard and he has not looked back from that day to this. His is a very rare story of continued success that has had the simultaneous blessing of critics, the public and musicians alike.  This film by Christopher Nupen shows Kissin in preparation, interview, rehearsal and performance, with several dazzling performances shot live on stage, in true concert conditions. It also contains all the encores from Kissin's memorable Promenade concert at the Royal Albert Hall, London, in August, 1997â€”the first Prom concert by a soloist, it attracted the biggest audience in all the 103 year history, very nearly six thousand people.  The music is by Liszt, Gluck, Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert, Paganini, Kissin himself and Chopin, the composer for whom Kissin feels the closest affinity.","popularity":0.4077,"poster_path":"/iKdKouCJJs737iHWNwel2Z1kYEX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":20960,"logo_path":"/9mO8Z3dcW6ISVMeCv7TbXtWXdGl.png","name":"RSI","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":258039,"logo_path":null,"name":"Allegro Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1999-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Gift of Music plus The Albert Hall Encores","title":"Evgeny Kissin: The Gift of Music","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Gift of Music","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Kissin: The Gift of Music","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evgeny Kissin","original_name":"Evgeny Kissin","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":"/fawdqNRICujbfqpK4KHtONsQbHB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f18c5f2c92c5d00363bdb9d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1574617,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Nupen","original_name":"Christopher Nupen","popularity":0.1149,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f18c674a6d931003783c16d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1574617,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Nupen","original_name":"Christopher Nupen","popularity":0.1149,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f18ca007a1bd60037e4e599","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0303980","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3UreahsbgAec78bPXasGEYjYt2r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iNunsEpKKS5nMiFG0MCcUi7WZoU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Aj228W6rmNPWnzMMEZ3TAN13wmo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/91yKebZ1TsGhcjkmteClnHTsJpF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iKdKouCJJs737iHWNwel2Z1kYEX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n5SxUE2U1e4Bc2I4NAuGefmp8CP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5783,"name":"classical music"},{"id":265689,"name":"classical pianist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BBC 4","release_date":"2008-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD","release_date":"2014-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
