This stunning collection of color 3D photos includes Allied reconnaissance photos, a trove of images that documents the rise and fall of the Third Reich, and photos secretly taken by a civilian in occupied France. WWII IN 3D also features an actual 3D motion picture film shot by the Nazis in 1943 and creates a fully immersive, three dimensional portrait of history's largest and bloodiest conflict.","popularity":0.455,"poster_path":"/vvB6elTAgW5mzMOzVOvIIcxniGH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4192,"logo_path":null,"name":"Flight 33 Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"WWII in 3D","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"2 Wojna Światowa w 3D","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"La Seconda Guerra Mondiale in 3D","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"World War II in 3D","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Segunda Guerra Mundial en 3D","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"History in 3D","type":"DVD box"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"WW2 in 3D","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"World War 2 in 3D","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Wilkinson","original_name":"Tom Wilkinson","popularity":1.3855,"profile_path":"/d5yLk0PK8q7EKR3E3G2txO758IW.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5ffd3a9b6611b400406181e0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2309073,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dion Labriola","original_name":"Dion Labriola","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/37MZrwJMnHgZYQrqkdz6iqQjdCM.jpg","credit_id":"5ffd3a568e8d300040d85764","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1097812,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Douglas J.
