In the neighborhood cinema, the two friends secretly idolize the figure of a vampire up on the screen. In a magical twist, Count Karpatovicz steps out of the screen to help the boys realize Niko’s sister Tatjana’s dream of escaping from the confines of the rundown tenement to become a boxing champion.","popularity":0.3488,"poster_path":"/aCAiTTbVNGLrwCSrpeSImriG8ME.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7201,"logo_path":"/ljV8ZT3CIYCEIEDlTyBliXJVCZr.png","name":"NDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":101037,"logo_path":null,"name":"Schneider
