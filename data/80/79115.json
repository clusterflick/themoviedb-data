Driven by a restless urge to conquer new women, use them, and throw them away, he has hired his friend Leporello to help create a masterpiece: A filmed database of all the women whose dreams Juan has shattered. We follow Juan and Leporello through 24 compressed hours. Juan seduces the young upper-class girl Anna, but ends up accidentally killing her father, a powerful police commissioner. The two friends run away, but Juan's constant need to seduce new women keeps interrupting their flight. As the police gains in on them, Juan also steals the young bride Zerlina from her groom Masetto, and soon a feverish manhunt is on for Juan.","popularity":0.2202,"poster_path":"/9Np9KccokNoTy3s6COt35uSLEko.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Juan","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":585995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Maltman","original_name":"Christopher Maltman","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/aCmXtIudNh5K2nY65GAsZX105yt.jpg","cast_id":1002,"character":"Juan","credit_id":"52fe49c2c3a368484e13e3d9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":585996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikhail Petrenko","original_name":"Mikhail Petrenko","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":"/9IkIsvUzhvC4XM1e2hTjkZnYAQU.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"Leporello","credit_id":"52fe49c2c3a368484e13e3dd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":585997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Futral","original_name":"Elizabeth Futral","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1004,"character":"Elvira","credit_id":"52fe49c2c3a368484e13e3e1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":585998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Bengtsson","original_name":"Maria Bengtsson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/nNyUsGPJRmneVDcOxbqZT6UYWw8.jpg","cast_id":1005,"character":"Anna","credit_id":"52fe49c2c3a368484e13e3e5","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64954,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mikkel E.G.
