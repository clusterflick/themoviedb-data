On the border between mainstream and psychedelic underground, their song \"Born to Be Wild\" became the anthem of an entire generation. The new, hard sound of Steppenwolf was a stab in the heart of the \"Summer of Love\" and put an end to the hippie era. It is no coincidence that they were the very first band to use the word \"heavy metal\" in their lyrics.","popularity":1.0788,"poster_path":"/zUEX1QnzlwD7AU118LmaR0VO27e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36946,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rezolution
