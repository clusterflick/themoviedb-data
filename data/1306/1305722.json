Rock in Rio is not only one of the most famous festivals, but also the origin of the Hollywood Vampires' first live album. With Alice Cooper as frontman, Hollywood superstar Johnny Depp, Aerosmith legend Joe Perry and producer and songwriter Tommy Henriksen, this band already has a top-class line-up. Still, the list of superstars doesn't end there. Joining them on stage are Duff McKagan (Guns N' Roses), Matt Sorum (Velvet Revolver) and Bruce Witkin (Grammy nominated producer). Special guests include Lzzy Hale (Halestorm), Andreas Kisser (Sepultura) and Zak Starkey (The Who / Oasis). A star line-up that has never been seen before on a single show. The album was produced by Bob Ezrin (Deep Purple, KISS, Pink Floyd, etc.).","popularity":0.0918,"poster_path":"/xwE90yHZjo5lNNIHktLar38mPO8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hollywood Vampires: Live In Rio","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.66,"height":1749,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xwE90yHZjo5lNNIHktLar38mPO8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1154}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
