Over the years, Lee's has witnessed many transformations within the DC community. It began on the U Street corridor, also known as Black Broadway, during a time when African-Americans were able to own businesses despite the Jim Crow laws. Throughout its history, Lee's has endured significant moments in US history, such as the Washington DC riots following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., and the George Floyd protests in 2020. Through these events, Lee's has served the entire community of the nation's capital, providing flower arrangements for occasions ranging from Mother's Day celebrations for grandmothers to welcoming international guests on behalf of US Presidents.","popularity":0.092,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Legacy of Lee's Flower Shop","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3390471,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kamilah Thurmon","original_name":"Kamilah Thurmon","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666ef271b21216b526a62fa5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"DC/DOX Festival","release_date":"2024-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
