He unintentionally uttered the word \"Talaq\" during an argument, and according to local religious tradition, if a husband says \"Talaq\" to his wife three times in a row, it means he is divorced. While Salimsak, who has never thought of leaving his wife, prays for a solution, his wife, under the influence of the popular slogan of \"women's liberation\", is thinking of divorce. ......... The collapse of Salimsak's small traditional family in the current of the times is a metaphor for the collapse of director Daniyah's family. The metaphor of the collapse epitomizes the core of the films of the director Daniyar Salamat, who has been writing in Kazakh since his debut and believes that cinema has a great significance in social education, and that the spirit of the nation cannot be restored without the progress of cinema.","popularity":0.1384,"poster_path":"/bqICAgK2uxl1omAC1ggsdcO8XcN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","name":"Kazakhstan"}],"release_date":"2024-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Divorceâ€Ž","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Talaq","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4789811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Omarova Amira","original_name":"Omarova Amira","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/kpMXxsTgsplOFg6LqwseN9AD0iz.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66779b91805d516f66ce9291","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2838177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yerbolat Alkozha","original_name":"Yerbolat Alkozha","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":"/9v0iB8xAqBVFFSr0BmXl2tCtWcd.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sarimsak","credit_id":"66779bb421696f7604ce924d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4631175,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniyar Salamat","original_name":"Daniyar Salamat","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/9TZ8SskNIYP7r5BKRt96ew9pj0w.jpg","credit_id":"666df23a6ebca4a22c0f8e1a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4631175,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniyar Salamat","original_name":"Daniyar Salamat","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/9TZ8SskNIYP7r5BKRt96ew9pj0w.jpg","credit_id":"666df241eadbf12b754bc598","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32503015","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.754,"height":2652,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bqICAgK2uxl1omAC1ggsdcO8XcN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Shanghai International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
