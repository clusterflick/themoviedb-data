With a series of testimonials and explanations from specialists, the documentary traces the difficulties encountered by filmmakers and actors regarding homosexuality. The stereotypes and biased representations that have long prevailed on screen are also examined. L'homosexualité au cinéma, les chemins de la victoire also examines emblematic works that have been synonymous with major turning points in LGBTQ+ visibility, and celebrates the contributions of pioneers who dared to tackle these taboo themes. The film takes a critical look at the effects of cinema on the public perception of homosexuality and highlights the various struggles for equality and recognition over time.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/wL5FXDdTMZ8bvaNeANkDqZCWTAZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2024-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Homosexualité au cinéma, les chemins de la victoire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2684522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sonia Medina","original_name":"Sonia Medina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6670b2e5e6cd87b7c0d1e8cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32639698","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y2SM9T3ksFozzzE2pRFNK0eMgLo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/wL5FXDdTMZ8bvaNeANkDqZCWTAZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bpbE8mikUXx4RBskgQLtgwCliT0.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Source: IMDb","release_date":"2024-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
