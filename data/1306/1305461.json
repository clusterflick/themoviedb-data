In the context of France in the era of “Me too,” her daughter's hopes for a better future collide with the reality of daily, systemic gender violence. The “land of women” of the title does not exist, but alongside the bitter realization of a male-oriented society, the tension and collective effort for radical change emerges. Between cinema, confession, and literature, the film is a chronicle of life moments and encounters with women committed to fighting gender violence.","popularity":0.0658,"poster_path":"/za1d6nETVzrSgCK31LtDkhow1SZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Between cinema, confession, and literature","title":"Letter to my daughter from the land of women","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1645573,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Silvia Staderoli","original_name":"Silvia Staderoli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666f476ad85dffa850236d90","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1645573,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Silvia Staderoli","original_name":"Silvia Staderoli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666f4775879e9855c4236cd7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2481,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/za1d6nETVzrSgCK31LtDkhow1SZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1754}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Cinema Lumière Sala Scorsese Bologna","release_date":"2024-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
