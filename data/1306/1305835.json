But when leading Jewish scholars convened in 1980, they estimated that only 70,000 Yiddish books remained in the world. This engaging, often funny documentary film chronicles the adventures of an enterprising 23-year-old named Aaron Lansky, who rallied together an international network of volunteers and set out to rescue the world's Yiddish books. Twenty years later, the National Yiddish Book Center has collected 1.5 million Yiddish books and helped save a rich diverse, and surprisingly modern literature from oblivion. With rare archival images, and a lyrical portrayal of the National Yiddish Book Center's warehouse and cultural complex, A Bridge Of Books celebrates a pursuit that has become a powerful vehicle for the transmission of history, culture and identity across several generations.","popularity":0.3504,"poster_path":"/rPxxvKUC3Ncl2uUnR6gAKJGUtnB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":230181,"logo_path":"/9bjMEufvWqfNp1ZpO9c9Vc9sdxf.png","name":"Citizen Film","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Bridge of Books","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3695128,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Ball","original_name":"Sam Ball","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/uycEduSLLLetiVZA3WCYialkDp0.jpg","credit_id":"6670997d3d9da60060d1e7dc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3695128,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Ball","original_name":"Sam Ball","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/uycEduSLLLetiVZA3WCYialkDp0.jpg","credit_id":"6670998fe88f5770d253a11a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4780622,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Larry London","original_name":"Larry London","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667099a69bf07fa42053a1a5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1833274,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Melissa R.
