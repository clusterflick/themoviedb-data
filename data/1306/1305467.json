Every night he stays up all night playing mahjong and drinking. Masao lives his life aimlessly, and even the university he got into after failing the entrance exam twice is on the verge of repeating the year. One day, a high school classmate and friend who graduated from Tokyo University and got a job at a top bank is invited to his wedding reception, and Masao is invited as well. However, Masao feels uncomfortable with the glamor of the surroundings, and when Rie, who is also attending, comforts him, he blurts out, half-jokingly, that he might compete in the Olympics.","popularity":0.2089,"poster_path":"/mmmzcWQJymrrjqHKK2N1qDUEHiv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1393,"logo_path":"/lUACMATs6jcscXIrzNCQzbvNVN5.png","name":"TBS","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lonely Olympics","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Koichi Sato","original_name":"佐藤浩市","popularity":0.7625,"profile_path":"/pxrNrFs3GUmCosKHXsuDX2MmSvX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Masao","credit_id":"666f4e933dcd86aee0236d52","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":109662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hideko Hara","original_name":"原日出子","popularity":0.6151,"profile_path":"/sJOOcvnVeRhf8UfjRRE32yPHao2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"666f4eba9901d48cd9a63548","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1128405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keiko Yanagawa","original_name":"柳川慶子","popularity":0.2459,"profile_path":"/sGdhNv9dg2P4TbrIh0sntCqlm7w.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"666f4ec26482c0c836930eb3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryutaro Otomo","original_name":"大友柳太朗","popularity":0.4719,"profile_path":"/ytpAwnbKaKQZQuSMBWWkK1URcse.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"666f4ed6ccdad16242236e21","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tōru Abe","original_name":"安部徹","popularity":0.422,"profile_path":"/oLY4lrFDEhGE6uXToMq53Q1kAWP.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"666f4edfb21216b526a635dd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryoichi Kusanagi","original_name":"草薙良一","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":"/ff6iqhtNIVJ34j5h7ynecNlbeCX.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"666f4eecbe0a8dcf9c930f85","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shuntaro Tamamura","original_name":"玉村俊太郎","popularity":0.1778,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"666f4ef9606886b8c1f916f8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2116839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hachiro Okamoto","original_name":"Hachiro Okamoto","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"666f4f1b5c3d4f334ff916fb","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2047032,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yasuo Yagi","original_name":"八木康夫","popularity":0.1063,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666f4f74606886b8c1f9170b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3150417,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kaori Watanabe","original_name":"Kaori Watanabe","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666f4f5b04d8756ea9ec0300","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4778641,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Junji Yamagiwa","original_name":"Junji Yamagiwa","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666f4f909901d48cd9a6355e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4539539,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mineaki Hata","original_name":"畑嶺明","popularity":0.0525,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666f4f400eb602cf8bd1c005","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4WMLK55FgGw4tuqHS1srU5iZb2o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mmmzcWQJymrrjqHKK2N1qDUEHiv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1983-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
