He met a Tantric sage who trapped him, intending to make him a sacrifice to goddess Kali; but was later freed secretly by Kapalkundala. The priest urged Nabakumar to take Kapalkundala away from her wicked foster-father and also showed Nabakumar his way to Saptagram. Now re-christened as Mrinmoyee. The sage, on the other hand, got annoyed at Kapalkundala’s betrayal and began to plot his revenge. In the meantime, Nabakumar met Padmabati, his first wife, who was converted to Islam by his father, making Nabakumar to desert her. Padmabati, now renamed as Motibibi, expressed her love for Nabakumar, but he refused her. Later the sage came to Saptagram and met Motibibi. The sage wanted to kill Kapalkundala, but Motibibi wanted to separate her from Nabkumar only.","popularity":0.2008,"poster_path":"/oxaaagG2HPhv6too6bJCCJjAVcq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1952-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kapalkundala","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1289230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bhanu Banerjee","original_name":"Bhanu Banerjee","popularity":0.119,"profile_path":"/rBOM5khanFAUyBn0yTRVUAWXvCT.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"666ec346b4682bc1ab9306ea","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tulsi Chakraborty","original_name":"Tulsi Chakraborty","popularity":0.1551,"profile_path":"/rRyitVbDqnP8pnq1KYfelSD2PNJ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"666ec355c439994efe6bc010","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nripati Chatterjee","original_name":"Nripati Chatterjee","popularity":0.1398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"666ec3602d047594e36bc2a8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1554966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nitish Mukherjee","original_name":"Nitish Mukherjee","popularity":0.1248,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"666ec391cd8dabcbe347d127","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3163932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ardhendu Mukherjee","original_name":"Ardhendu Mukherjee","popularity":0.1124,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666ec216a91d9e4d108c9752","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231354,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hemanta Mukherjee","original_name":"Hemanta Mukherjee","popularity":0.1206,"profile_path":"/5WVkfHGpVl2TbFaZI5RZasjFQoq.jpg","credit_id":"666ec25d6820a39a80ebfb17","department":"Sound","job":"Playback Singer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1145700,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay","original_name":"Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666ec26fc4e157e42a9307b2","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2689074,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Narayan Gangopadhyay","original_name":"Narayan Gangopadhyay","popularity":0.0762,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666ec3d30a79b65b7f47d11b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0244015","wikidata_id":"Q123900981","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oxaaagG2HPhv6too6bJCCJjAVcq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":324700,"name":"classic"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"bn","note":"","release_date":"1952-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
