The major news media did not cover this march. No photos appeared in either newspapers or magazines and it was a non-event for tv news. I tried to convey in the film the experience of a marcher, with the sights and sounds of the beginning of the march at Central Park's Sheep's Meadow, down along 5 Avenue and ending at the U. N. plaza, with the sights and sounds of anti-protesters along the marching route. This film is meant to be a record of this first massive peace march which was not covered by any news media., on SATURDAY, 4/15/1967.\"","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Saturday 4/15/67","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4778243,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Weisburd","original_name":"Harry Weisburd","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"666eee456a1313b26ce288ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
