On November 25, 1960, Trujillo had all three sisters assassinated. The assassinations turned the Mirabal sisters into national heroines and symbols of feminist resistance. The documentary interweaves interviews with over forty witnesses to the story, including the Mirabal family friends, colleagues, co-revolutionaries, teachers, and most importantly, their surviving sister, Dedé, along with dramatic reenactments and archival footage.","popularity":0.2529,"poster_path":"/wi1gU9B12fmIrX8P3yILfuhk7cY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":231638,"logo_path":null,"name":"Accent
