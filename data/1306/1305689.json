The little round loaf tumbles through the hands of a host of hungry characters in the modern Russian urban jungle. Seen through his freshly-baked eyes, the artefacts of the Soviet empire loom large as we are plunged into a maelstrom of comic references to Russian life and culture, in which archaic film and folk customs survive among the mechanical guts of a modern city.","popularity":0.0597,"poster_path":"/hpmR99NvMGIkQ4HwMU8zyMC4EE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18889,"logo_path":"/30mRFDmJAdbOMCFhFGst9izWJhD.png","name":"Il Luster","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The story of the kolobok","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4779852,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James M.
