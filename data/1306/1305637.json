(The Living Dead Club), whose members apparently see it as their task to help each other to \"end this empty earthly existence\" according to a lottery system. At the same time, an acquaintance of Tom Haget, Lieutenant Dick Huntley, receives an assignment from his superiors to go to a distant destination with a large sum of money. However, Huntley is hit by a car, unconscious and without ID documents he ends up in a hospital, is reported missing, and it is widely suspected that he ran away with the money. Confused and desperate Huntley meets Haget and gets an invitation to the Living Dead Club.","popularity":0.3259,"poster_path":"/zzWTqYIiCkoixH6xOamhw4tcCmq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1914-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"De lefvande dödas klubb","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Larsson","original_name":"William Larsson","popularity":0.0998,"profile_path":"/gkFvVTH8mK31GsB3JRS21plVd1e.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66700135b21216b526a64f55","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":559954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Barcklind","original_name":"Carl Barcklind","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":"/pzYcH2vLlD52TOqSWmu3ds8piYy.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6670013beb7f5c3e6b54750e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4779593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hedvig Nenzén","original_name":"Hedvig Nenzén","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"667001414e4a57683ded93f8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nils Aréhn","original_name":"Nils Aréhn","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/8iKENizuIar1yrLuVm2hyuIivrx.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6670014d8f25b219f9d1dfd6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2345314,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hilma Barcklind","original_name":"Hilma Barcklind","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"66700155cc73de82a1ed93e0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Ekman","original_name":"John Ekman","popularity":0.1161,"profile_path":"/fQf5brJBFY1DDlYYT5dJP1HvDHo.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6670015b04d8756ea9ec1a5f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4779594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edla Lund","original_name":"Edla Lund","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"66700169c1ffa5db6a266b42","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1167484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jenny Tschernichin-Larsson","original_name":"Jenny Tschernichin-Larsson","popularity":0.099,"profile_path":"/fMBV3u2M0oRv9znfAPFnRgSfHfX.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"66700171c1ffa5db6a266b45","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1925951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harald Wehlnor","original_name":"Harald Wehlnor","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/nqIe0CN4eboamLo7y4PSkC37MKW.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"66700178cc73de82a1ed93e3","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":559954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Barcklind","original_name":"Carl Barcklind","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":"/pzYcH2vLlD52TOqSWmu3ds8piYy.jpg","credit_id":"66700103a8c94ab764ed93ea","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227402,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Julius Jaenzon","original_name":"Julius Jaenzon","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":"/8D1xebxH52YJhbgKE5d4cmJawlU.jpg","credit_id":"6670012737b25ce968ec1f89","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29533,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert Louis Stevenson","original_name":"Robert Louis Stevenson","popularity":0.5342,"profile_path":"/4gHYG4Gn1uxmG0k1gilfp8cwdBX.jpg","credit_id":"667001198db766c057ed93f4","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":559954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Barcklind","original_name":"Carl Barcklind","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":"/pzYcH2vLlD52TOqSWmu3ds8piYy.jpg","credit_id":"667000fe84cabea926ec1fba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23779954","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zzWTqYIiCkoixH6xOamhw4tcCmq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
