Entre a Luz e o Nada by Joana de Sousa, Sob Influência by Ricardo Branco, and Uma Rapariga Imaterial by André Godinho are three cinematic gestures that explore techniques and narratives from science fiction to horror, seeking new ways to view and imagine other possibilities. After traveling through various festivals, these films can now be experienced together, in a mutual exploration of mysterious worlds, unsettling dreams, and singular visions.","popularity":0.2175,"poster_path":"/msDHaiw2vUZUk61XI4gMKoffTIl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139887,"logo_path":"/gfcvJ3P9dODgAgbAnfak2ABSvwc.png","name":"Promenade","origin_country":"PT"},{"id":9047,"logo_path":"/a0oCybecb96ieZY4139hb9uqYs1.png","name":"Terratreme","origin_country":"PT"},{"id":88760,"logo_path":null,"name":"Primeira
