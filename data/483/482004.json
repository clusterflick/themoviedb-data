So why did The Dana Carvey Show—with a writers room and cast including then unknowns Steve Carell, Stephen Colbert, Louis C.K., Robert Smigel, Charlie Kaufman, and more— crash and burn so spectacularly? TOO FUNNY TO FAIL tells the hilarious true story of a crew of genius misfits who set out to make comedy history… and succeeded in a way they never intended.","popularity":2.5258,"poster_path":"/daOljc1BMtILw8XYQRcVu0bHObj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21398,"logo_path":"/6pmnhKdo9ziUS0XxYKx69UWSIW2.png","name":"Delirio
