From his prison cell in 1992, the political prisoner Raymond Luc Levasseur writes 'My Blood is Quebecois' in which he explains his rebellion and his radicalization by his status as a 'frog' and the racism he witnessed in a small mill town of Maine where his ancestors came to work in the factories. Released in 2004, he returned to his native Maine where he tells us about his career, from his childhood in a French Canadian family until today.","popularity":0.236,"poster_path":"/zqUE798CKQSKKmbvT9Uzf6B9cB1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96385,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Tricycle","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An American, Portrait of Raymond Luc Levasseur","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Un américain, portrait de Raymond Luc Levasseur","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1909022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Luc Levasseur","original_name":"Raymond Luc Levasseur","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59e9fb5f9251410c74012cdc","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1208823,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Colin Stetson","original_name":"Colin Stetson","popularity":0.1676,"profile_path":"/9ri32xE54Tw3PDIyGhvYVShqnAZ.jpg","credit_id":"61225c43719aeb0045952498","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1091343,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sarah Neufeld","original_name":"Sarah Neufeld","popularity":0.0902,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61225c48d6590b007e0fa8ce","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1909025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Marier","original_name":"Pierre Marier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e9fb8fc3a3687fc60124c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1909025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Marier","original_name":"Pierre Marier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e9fba6c3a36875e2006f6b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1909025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Marier","original_name":"Pierre Marier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e9fbc4c3a36827fa011347","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1909025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Marier","original_name":"Pierre Marier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e9fbcfc3a3687f810118b7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1909027,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Thomas Szacka-Marier","original_name":"Thomas Szacka-Marier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e9fc719251415b1f00015b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1909028,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Martine Cossette","original_name":"Martine Cossette","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e9fc879251410c62012efc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1767073,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bruno Bélanger","original_name":"Bruno Bélanger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e9fd62c3a3687fc6012703","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1909025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Marier","original_name":"Pierre Marier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e9fd95c3a3687f81011acb","department":"Sound","job":"Boom Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1667427,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Catherine Van Der Donckt","original_name":"Catherine Van Der Donckt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e9fdc8c3a36827fa0115ba","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5560682","wikidata_id":"Q113977206","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vk8UpQZ5QuU5vv01KzKEMF5MPS6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":814,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zqUE798CKQSKKmbvT9Uzf6B9cB1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":543}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
