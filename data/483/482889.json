Here he evokes a career spent collecting fragments of other people's lives, and journeys back to the cell where he found himself sharing the fate of the people he writes about. His words, the narrative fabric of the film, turn into action: we follow him first along the Donbass front and then on his return journey, to the place \"where it all began and where it all ended:\" Syria. Because \"it's not about going home; it's about coming back here.\"","popularity":0.1145,"poster_path":"/ehKZGwM4u9JPDvftldFd90EHeJK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46344,"logo_path":"/qpSdIjnGHiz6UNIQWGIJkDnG79l.png","name":"Frenesy Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":155990,"logo_path":"/py9VaywwK6KVi94YwrxSKVg1gkh.png","name":"RAI Cinema","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":80758,"logo_path":null,"name":"Deneb Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2016-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shadows from Within","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Shadows from Within","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2036933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Domenico Quirico","original_name":"Domenico Quirico","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"SÃ© stesso","credit_id":"5aee19c892514119120007a2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luca Guadagnino","original_name":"Luca Guadagnino","popularity":0.9933,"profile_path":"/vWCkSOW65g8Ha26BzRxn5KhTEnF.jpg","credit_id":"6653684d1d26a1aac40f27aa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2036930,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paola Piacenza","original_name":"Paola Piacenza","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aee19959251411912000789","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2036930,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paola Piacenza","original_name":"Paola Piacenza","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aee19a6c3a368077d0011c3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2036930,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paola Piacenza","original_name":"Paola Piacenza","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ac678e7f2fa9eb79bb3572","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1306683,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ugo Carlevaro","original_name":"Ugo Carlevaro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ac679ae09d6c9190b09b81","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1566194,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Valentina Andreoli","original_name":"Valentina Andreoli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ac67aa7f2fa9eb79bb357d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84258,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Walter Fasano","original_name":"Walter Fasano","popularity":0.1304,"profile_path":"/4GKmfdJoZXXFDBmC3YgaWzdz59X.jpg","credit_id":"67ac67caf85f19913a9b8829","department":"Editing","job":"Supervising Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3548479,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Daniele Vascelli","original_name":"Daniele Vascelli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ac67d89ed73a4324b092c1","department":"Sound","job":"Boom Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6524532","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ehKZGwM4u9JPDvftldFd90EHeJK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2016-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
