It is a story of a bunch of youngsters trapped and fighting their existence, and traces their lives through 4 parallel tracks. The film delves and inter-weaves the lives of 2 teenaged Dharavi rappers, a coffee-shop waiter who runs his drug delivery at the coffee shop, an under-aged teenage girl who hasn't left her posh South Mumbai apartment in 2 years as she lives the guilt of accidently killing her friends, and another girl staying in the slums working as house help in upmarket Mumbai. As we follow them, we realize that either they are fighting their identities, or are trying to alter their realities or have reluctantly succumbed to it.","popularity":0.2418,"poster_path":"/fpiMO4rTpUpXBvsLbZHs00JYIiZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zoo","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1312081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shashank Arora","original_name":"Shashank Arora","popularity":0.2898,"profile_path":"/q5S5TlJabJz13E8CK6nZzkv6kOu.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Bicky","credit_id":"59edb43dc3a3682edc025c99","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1380116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rahul S Kumar","original_name":"Rahul S Kumar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Messi","credit_id":"59edb44cc3a368752f01e33b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1469936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shweta Tripathi Sharma","original_name":"Shweta Tripathi Sharma","popularity":0.2711,"profile_path":"/xZ0pk5qKzfK1oB54Mmfo1lUSSEu.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Misha Mehta","credit_id":"59edb478925141366d01921d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1910620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Prince Daniel","original_name":"Prince Daniel","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Prince","credit_id":"59edb487c3a36871bc021791","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1910621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yogesh Kurme","original_name":"Yogesh Kurme","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Yoku","credit_id":"59edb493925141278301f40a","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shlok Sharma","original_name":"Shlok Sharma","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59edb4a6c3a368535b02711c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shlok Sharma","original_name":"Shlok Sharma","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59edb4ad9251413db900beb9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1910622,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shilpa Srivastava","original_name":"Shilpa Srivastava","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59edb4bac3a36879fe02b656","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6149820","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cX1bJVPz4GdHZetvu2CYEl3ObqM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/m3C4zjV5kXCKuPKXYVTtOBIULB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/A3UHsfUUJGePSFYyt8F61Diefrm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":3.093,"height":410,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tgVjn7eyloJoOHYN6PvEF5SXqRj.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1268}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"hi","file_path":"/lZMwheUnQRBfIMTSQHB92rvaiZa.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":530},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fpiMO4rTpUpXBvsLbZHs00JYIiZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/e1FZlolBqmZMjlyY1XkUWtan0de.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":315446,"name":"bollywood"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hi","note":"","release_date":"2018-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
