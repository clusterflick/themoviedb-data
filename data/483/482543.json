A multi-faceted and all-round artist, his work is labyrinthine, probably comprising some 30,000 prints, not counting his oil paintings and the books he illustrated. The painter’s life was rich, his work was prolific, and both were imbued with a multitude of signs most of which are unknown to us. This documentary embarks upon a journey and pays a “visit to Hokusai”, in the company of his enlightened admirers - Japanese connoisseurs, who are familiar with all these signs.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Art","title":"The Eye of Hokusai","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
