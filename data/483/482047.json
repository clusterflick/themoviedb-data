Inundated by the drugs, China was forced to open up its market, and the British consolidated their commercial dominance.  In 1839, the Middle Empire introduced prohibition. The Opium War was declared… Great Britain emerged as the winner, but the warning was heeded: it could no longer depend on Chinese tea. The only alternative possible was to produce its own tea. The East India Company therefore entrusted one man with finding the secrets of the precious beverage.  His mission was to develop the first plantations in Britain’s Indian colonies. This latter-day James Bond was called Robert Fortune – a botanist. After overcoming innumerable ordeals in the heart of imperial China, he brought back the plants and techniques that gave rise to Darjeeling tea.","popularity":1.0225,"poster_path":"/bF60IwyULSwgLlMZefPo0pZm5vw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37107,"logo_path":"/kZk5reYTCCXdGcorE1ZruEoQKYc.png","name":"La Compagnie des
