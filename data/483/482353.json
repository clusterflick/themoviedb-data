Ros brings us up close to a personal choice of Sevres masterpieces in the Wallace Collection, viewing them in intricate and intimate detail. She engages us with the beauty and brilliance in the designs, revelling in what is now often viewed as unfashionably pretty or ostentatious. These objects represent the unbelievable skills of 18th-century France, as well as the desires and demands of an autocratic regime that was heading for revolution.","popularity":0.2464,"poster_path":"/eY5qrobufm5V2g8GuyQGogC3XLt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beautiful Thing: A Passion for Porcelain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1587487,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Simon Beeley","original_name":"Simon Beeley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"65c3ac2ee7c0970164cfaabd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1323607,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Randall Wright","original_name":"Randall Wright","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c3ac6ae7c0970164cfaae7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1323607,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Randall Wright","original_name":"Randall Wright","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c3ac5e3fe7970183ff1303","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jSwOVGgcEmyg2dbeqy1TI0leEBO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eY5qrobufm5V2g8GuyQGogC3XLt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":853}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2828,"name":"porcelain figure"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2013-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
