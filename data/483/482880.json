The woman's jewel necklace is worth a fortune. But her secretary, Natalie Knowles, is secretly a famed cat burglar, and wants the necklace for herself. The two thieves outwit each other at every turn, all the while realizing they're a perfect match. But the star-crossed lovers have a surprise on their hands when they realize the jewels are a fake, and the princess an imposter! Hidden Aces was Charles Hutchison's seventh and final appearance as 'Hutch' Hutchdale, the character he originated in 1921's Hurricane Hutch.","popularity":0.273,"poster_path":"/2l69DvVNWJ8vHHpq4Zd6hkGOUTu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96478,"logo_path":null,"name":"Louis T.
