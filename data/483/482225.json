The villagers ostracized her and the town boss raped her, keeping her as his unwilling mistress throughout much of her adolescence. At 15, she took control of her destiny and escaped to Mexico City to begin a new life. Now middle-aged, Paulina returns to her village to confront her family about what happened and encounters a web of intrigue and denial. PAULINA interweaves documentary and fiction styles to explore the characters' radically different perspectives and memories, and those of this vital, resilient woman.","popularity":0.095,"poster_path":"/fTw5WxTXrzvWvpDPTG2kStE42AX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paulina","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":131456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vicky Funari","original_name":"Vicky Funari","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e919d7c3a3681a690075ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0155004","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.759,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fTw5WxTXrzvWvpDPTG2kStE42AX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1138}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":534,"name":"mexico"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"1997-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sundance Film Festival","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
