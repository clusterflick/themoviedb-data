The end of his relationship with Matina causes him to work obsessively on his new novel, making it difficult for him to interact with the opposite sex. One day while moping over Matina, Antoine is hit by a car driven by Charlotte, a married mother of two and the manager of a hip boutique. Despite their differences, an attraction quickly develops between Charlotte and Antoine, and they soon add Elisabeth, a brainy and beautiful teenage prostitute, to their sticky couplings. Meanwhile, Charlotte's husband Joey sits at home and watches dispassionately as his wife abandons him and their kids for epic nights of passion.","popularity":0.1504,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Invention of Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Invention of Love","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David La Haye","original_name":"David La Haye","popularity":0.2825,"profile_path":"/gO2EMBJ64CbHNPE90hjktYB3mI0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d3d9251416c9110f4dd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":233731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pascale Montpetit","original_name":"Pascale Montpetit","popularity":0.115,"profile_path":"/5MXTa0H1dAqEohCj9aS1DXlF0sz.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d3d9251416c9110f4e1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1177057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Delphine Brodeur","original_name":"Delphine Brodeur","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d3d9251416c9110f4e5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102852,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andreas Apergis","original_name":"Andreas Apergis","popularity":0.3459,"profile_path":"/yK6qWJ9KgEeJsGGK3Fu6ldR3HkD.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d3d9251416c9110f4e9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4452635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irene Stamou","original_name":"Irene Stamou","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"658df13055c1f461d439e1d6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1670912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henri Chassé","original_name":"Henri Chassé","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/rb1d6ftm2N01jVaR9WtZFD5Xksx.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"658df1368ed03f5dee943736","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4452636,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Felix Beaudry","original_name":"Felix Beaudry","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"658df14420e6a57c6a8b4719","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1177056,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claude Demers","original_name":"Claude Demers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d3d9251416c9110f4d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1177056,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claude Demers","original_name":"Claude Demers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658df150f2cf2513b54cbc1f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":959308,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nicolas Bolduc","original_name":"Nicolas Bolduc","popularity":0.1582,"profile_path":"/zno78ThM4dWT5TKIPDwZUdg7Qcz.jpg","credit_id":"67f3033d1bb0472899993a90","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0204414","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
