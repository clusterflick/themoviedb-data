Their efforts to conceive naturally have been unsuccessful, so they decide to try using the newest artificial methods of conception. Unfortunately for them, the clinician they contact for help is also given to conducting unauthorized experiments on the human lifespan, cloning, etc. Eventually the fertilization effort is successful, and Marie has conceived quadruplets. The couple discusses this situation while driving, and are killed in an auto accident.","popularity":0.1601,"poster_path":"/uxYJ6XgOgCrrlVRtALwh2fPSgh3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1988-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Longing for Eternity","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":232137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danielle Proulx","original_name":"Danielle Proulx","popularity":0.4464,"profile_path":"/fcSWJibnKHK5ZI1aOYEVtVmXr2B.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Marie","credit_id":"52fe4d3e9251416c9110f7f9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86618,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Messier","original_name":"Marc Messier","popularity":0.1878,"profile_path":"/37UUu035RXqRPgDAjA3vKuNQpco.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Pierre Lemieux","credit_id":"52fe4d3e9251416c9110f7fd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":963506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Savoie","original_name":"Paul Savoie","popularity":0.1304,"profile_path":"/vqR5MPb9XuIEuRldo3w8WwtqmRu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Antoine","credit_id":"52fe4d3e9251416c9110f801","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":543716,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Nolin","original_name":"Patricia Nolin","popularity":0.0788,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Hélène","credit_id":"52fe4d3e9251416c9110f805","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":565637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Cloutier","original_name":"Raymond Cloutier","popularity":0.1168,"profile_path":"/yXcBTIuQxBCuJU3aEgcCw4c5yEq.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Luc","credit_id":"52fe4d3e9251416c9110f809","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":38525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johanne-Marie Tremblay","original_name":"Johanne-Marie Tremblay","popularity":0.198,"profile_path":"/vjaIzsYH7qxImdpEO65hBVr3MpZ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Julie","credit_id":"52fe4d3e9251416c9110f80d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38528,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gilles Pelletier","original_name":"Gilles Pelletier","popularity":0.1242,"profile_path":"/lWIxWBXR6MbUP6aY4o4bBDCRY2Z.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Monsieur Lemieux (Pierre's father)","credit_id":"607ba3761b1f3c0029462cee","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1177679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Gadouas","original_name":"Daniel Gadouas","popularity":0.0569,"profile_path":"/vLNsrcpdDtL3vGZKPvO2yAGaT1R.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"François","credit_id":"607ba38aea89f50058cee0f2","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1177425,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Favreau","original_name":"Robert Favreau","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d3e9251416c9110f7f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38521,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Guy Dufaux","original_name":"Guy Dufaux","popularity":0.0935,"profile_path":"/17n6oMyeNoFdtkitjjByScupc86.jpg","credit_id":"66727a80f5b4a5b6f390d7b7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2286554,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marie-Andrée Vinet","original_name":"Marie-Andrée Vinet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66727aa7a1df98590555a450","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1177425,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Favreau","original_name":"Robert Favreau","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66727a92e8e4344576a398fc","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0098107","wikidata_id":"Q64847971","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uxYJ6XgOgCrrlVRtALwh2fPSgh3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
