As soon as this stone has been engraved, as by magic, a handsome young lady appears with a huge lump of clay covered with a cloth. As soon as the cloth is removed from the soft mass it starts whirling and turning as if stricken mad, and one is asking one's self what all the contentions are going to lead to, when the vague shape of an animal not yet discernible seems to appear, and before one has time to make one's mind as to the category of brutes to which it belongs one sees the form of a remarkably well made orang-utan modelled out of the clay, who calmly smokes his pipe. Then the statue is removed by the same winning young lady and another covered block of the same substance is carried forward.","popularity":0.4608,"poster_path":"/2aK7uCQaUUR1w3F7yQskc2IBkgY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1908-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Modern Sculptors","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Escultor moderno","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Sculpture moderne","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1119494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julienne Mathieu","original_name":"Julienne Mathieu","popularity":0.069,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"559e43d1c3a368081900113c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1167399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Deed","original_name":"André Deed","popularity":0.3646,"profile_path":"/prazmRnbuIUeHO6McGOUQHDUeOd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"559e43d89251412db20011a8","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41616,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Segundo de Chomón","original_name":"Segundo de Chomón","popularity":0.206,"profile_path":"/3iCsGlo1XUbvy61411fMHb8bZdP.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d369251416c9110e679","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1485699,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Georges Lucien Guyot","original_name":"Georges Lucien Guyot","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"559e43f09251412daf001145","department":"Art","job":"Sculptor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0140537","wikidata_id":"Q18147161","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2aK7uCQaUUR1w3F7yQskc2IBkgY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10121,"name":"stop motion"},{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"},{"id":211467,"name":"trick film"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1908-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Modern Sculptors (1908) Segundo de Chomón","key":"l5fkR7y8T84","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2012-08-26T20:47:50.000Z","id":"669d17386df2d464b3779540"}]}}}
