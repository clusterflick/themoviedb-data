As they pass by a group of children, the children throw snowballs at the riders, and they and other persons begin to join in the fun.

Everyone soon decides that they enjoy playing in the snow even more than riding.","popularity":0.9101,"poster_path":"/nStiGC0ondurfCNR3ynvy7q0nA1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18758,"logo_path":"/fe3cMUJLhbkTM9PDxdDA8hQpAxp.png","name":"Edison Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1906-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Winter Straw Ride","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edwin S.
