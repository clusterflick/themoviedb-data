One night in bed, Tomas (Tomas Arana), a magician, begins telling a story to his wife Desire (Marit Nissen) about Emma (Iaia Forte) and Sal (Tommaso Ragno), a married couple whose love life has gone stale. In order to fire up their relationship, Emma and Sal begin playing an increasingly elaborate series of role-playing games, in which they assume different personas -- Sal saves Emma as she is tied to railroad tracks, or Emma must seduce another man to pull her husband out of debt. But the question soon arises -- are Emma and Sal real? And who really holds the power in their lives? Chimera also features Franco Nero as one of the participants in Emma and Sal's sexual fantasies.","popularity":0.2948,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chimera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":68166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iaia Forte","original_name":"Iaia Forte","popularity":0.1071,"profile_path":"/xJPwCODM1Onk0iSeffseIpUBe0k.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d3d9251416c9110f4ff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":226353,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tommaso Ragno","original_name":"Tommaso Ragno","popularity":0.4448,"profile_path":"/jxCSg7hYjhilnYpTjXCFjGox5v6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d3d9251416c9110f503","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomas Arana","original_name":"Tomas Arana","popularity":0.5319,"profile_path":"/qMuQWxUQ2sXDiN2d9EDVT5VXHo2.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d3d9251416c9110f507","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1060591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marit Nissen","original_name":"Marit Nissen","popularity":0.1316,"profile_path":"/5DMIcJ7ihAKCP7x0PBXhvnIaA0y.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d3d9251416c9110f50b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72193,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pappi Corsicato","original_name":"Pappi Corsicato","popularity":0.0573,"profile_path":"/xtDKW6LUCcqkPBm1s06D4TkA1hq.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d3d9251416c9110f4fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0274426","wikidata_id":"Q3674730","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
