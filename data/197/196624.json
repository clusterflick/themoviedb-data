The film runs just a few seconds short of four minutes as several women are dressed up as bees dancing around their hive. The \"Queen Bee\" goes to take a nap and she's attacked by a spider. The spider sequence is what gets this film a mention by fantasy fans but sadly this scene takes place around the 3:13 mark and lasts just a few seconds.","popularity":0.0745,"poster_path":"/qEJjfEKMRGRVDWqTN0jMipT9SD7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1908-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bee and the Rose","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Bee and the Rose","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41616,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Segundo de Chomón","original_name":"Segundo de Chomón","popularity":0.206,"profile_path":"/3iCsGlo1XUbvy61411fMHb8bZdP.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d359251416c9110e503","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0449169","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qEJjfEKMRGRVDWqTN0jMipT9SD7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1908-12-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"L'Abeille et la rose (1908) The Bee and the Rose (Pathé)","key":"MTp8b5Ro8kg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-02-02T02:16:12.000Z","id":"6687c1ac5e5a595a945e5738"}]}}}
