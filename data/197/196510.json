We are treated to murderous Mexicans, conniving Jews, brawling Irish, bloodthirsty Scots, an Indian, and even Uncle Sam. This little black and white silent feature is an interesting look, especially in that we really don't know what we are seeing. Is this what it first appears - a racist comedy that shows a disdain for all non-WASPs? Is the final scene depicting most of the cast (except the dancing Negros) working together to show that America is a melting pot?","popularity":0.104,"poster_path":"/geB9Pshn1mBZJc8zlGvkoqMvxtf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":236929,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope and Biograph Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1907-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fights of Nations","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8819,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Billy Bitzer","original_name":"Billy Bitzer","popularity":0.1214,"profile_path":"/9nNC55iPLBuBK8KwQUoiK06piHW.jpg","credit_id":"5684e27ac3a36860e901a7ca","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0331491","wikidata_id":"Q60586352","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/geB9Pshn1mBZJc8zlGvkoqMvxtf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1907-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Fights Of Nations (1907 Original Black & White Film)","key":"rsiGxdkIh-I","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-04-23T22:00:28.000Z","id":"6683ad2b79e4f897229b2555"}]}}}
