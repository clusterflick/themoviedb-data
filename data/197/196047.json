Marshall continues with various feminine poses, reminiscent of classic Greek statuary, to accentuate her figure. Film cuts to Treloar posed on the bare stage without a pedestal. He wears brief leopard-skin trunks or short tunic, wrist bands, and Roman-looking laced sandals. His poses accentuate the muscular development of his upper body, particularly that of his arms, and include movements that make the muscles jump. Treloar finishes with a slight nod to the camera.","popularity":0.3151,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":18758,"logo_path":"/fe3cMUJLhbkTM9PDxdDA8hQpAxp.png","name":"Edison Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1904-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Treloar and Miss Marshall, Prize Winners at the Physical Culture Show in Madison Square Garden","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Male and Female Prize Winners at the Physical Culture Show, Madison Square Garden, Jan 2, 1904","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beatrice Marshall","original_name":"Beatrice Marshall","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5523f8779251417be200817b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Treloar","original_name":"Albert Treloar","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5523f88392514166c1002fb0","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edwin S.
