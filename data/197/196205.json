Screened in four parts, lasting a total of approximately twelve minutes, it shows a bunch of old boys, some in full military regalia, others in top hats and suits travelling by boat from one dock to another. From there they make up part of a parade as they travel to a hotel. The men are Russian and Japanese envoys gathered by President Teddy Roosevelt to hammer out a peace deal to bring the Russo-Japanese war to an end.","popularity":0.1741,"poster_path":"/fNwKMurFaP78enovm3eA3K1GyTV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18758,"logo_path":"/fe3cMUJLhbkTM9PDxdDA8hQpAxp.png","name":"Edison Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1905-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Scenes and Incidents, Russo-Japanese Peace Conference, Portsmouth, N.
