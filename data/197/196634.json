They begin a minuet and their costumes change in a sudden. A man enters and seems interested in what he sees, casts a spell and everything disappears. Transforming himself into the devil, the visitor takes the violinist with him to hell, where he creates a large piece of silk out of a cauldron. The fabric unrolls, revealing a young woman in a silk dress that starts dancing the serpentine. While she dances, other women join in a synchronized ballet, before all of them vanish into bursts of flames.","popularity":0.1834,"poster_path":"/qKbhPgdPmD6eN5TLUDltXX9IkwM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1908-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beginning of the Serpentine Dance","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"La creación de la serpentina","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1016035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Linder","original_name":"Max Linder","popularity":0.1786,"profile_path":"/b3PKyHuw6OyOATZeyOPJkC000mY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The ballet master","credit_id":"6689772950d911cc9da38583","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41616,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Segundo de Chomón","original_name":"Segundo de Chomón","popularity":0.206,"profile_path":"/3iCsGlo1XUbvy61411fMHb8bZdP.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d359251416c9110e5ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1669102","wikidata_id":"Q16545064","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7oclCj3Q2zfYTMzY4qpKpUxE3kl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1330},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qKbhPgdPmD6eN5TLUDltXX9IkwM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1691,"name":"dance"},{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1908-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Création de la serpentine (1908) Beginning of the Serpentine Dance (Pathé)","key":"yP4RfKOOyuU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-08-31T01:18:45.000Z","id":"6687b07424ec69ef87936d04"}]}}}
