Thus, after a few titles explaining the impact that gold mining has had on the country's Amazon region, along with helicopter footage (later to be blended into the narrative) of the ecologically devastated area, the film settles in on the lawless shanty town of Payapal for its narrative. Gallego (Armando Gota) runs the mine, exploiting his cheap labor force. Aroldo (Pedro Lander) breaks into Gallego's safe and steals his gold, along with a good deal of gold that Gallego was holding for his workers. Aroldo involves the unwitting Carmen (Jenny Noguera) in the robbery, and, when they are discovered, he shoots and kills Gallego's young son.","popularity":0.1366,"poster_path":"/ycPbpGCRrPeSqssEqdU05iKLZCl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30940,"logo_path":null,"name":"Joel Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"2000-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Devil's Gold","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","title":"Garimpeiros","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Devil's Gold","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":985153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laureano Olivares","original_name":"Laureano Olivares","popularity":0.0852,"profile_path":"/lIYm1xdL2MqGUiT8pW2UEqvkzo0.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Cae","credit_id":"53fa59e9c3a368735e0037a4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1356654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rocío Miranda","original_name":"Rocío Miranda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Isabel","credit_id":"53fa59f9c3a368735e0037ad","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1356655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Armando Gota","original_name":"Armando Gota","popularity":0.0549,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Gallego","credit_id":"53fa5a0cc3a368735e0037b5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1107047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pedro Lander","original_name":"Pedro Lander","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"563194b89251412857010bb5","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937320,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José Ramón Novoa","original_name":"José Ramón Novoa","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/wXQYL6YCUCyeEweW1zUateqhKZt.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d3d9251416c9110f51f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1356652,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sonia Chocrón","original_name":"Sonia Chocrón","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53fa58f50e0a267a75005aff","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1356208,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Francisco Cabrujas","original_name":"Francisco Cabrujas","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53fa590f0e0a267a780058a0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1355378,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Oscar Pérez","original_name":"Oscar Pérez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53fa59210e0a267a72005ad9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":54097,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Giuliano Ferrioli","original_name":"Giuliano Ferrioli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53fa59340e0a267a6f005b8e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0268255","wikidata_id":"Q7103685","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/ycPbpGCRrPeSqssEqdU05iKLZCl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":752,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/XBcFI643qfRTIIpHiKIcQ540x7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":502}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
