When the man comes home, he tears down the sign, and then proceeds to abuse his wife both verbally and physically.

When the vigilantes find out about this, they arm themselves with rifles and immediately go to confront the abusive husband.","popularity":0.2055,"poster_path":"/d9kTXb8AB7VibSuqiExToA2XGyG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18758,"logo_path":"/fe3cMUJLhbkTM9PDxdDA8hQpAxp.png","name":"Edison Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1905-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The White Caps","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1172579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Toncray","original_name":"Kate Toncray","popularity":0.2185,"profile_path":"/qb3ty4jC8UdZrvwjVHIilGjY4kr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"625b6172cb308400663b0ae3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John R.
