But a very large spanner is thrown into the works when Robert learns his late, eccentric, and very wealthy Uncle Leopold has willed them 23 million dollars. There is, of course, a catch -- before Robert and Alexandra can get the money, they have to conceive and give birth to a healthy child within a year. Given that there will be enough money to go around for everyone, Robert and Alexandra decide to give it a try, which doesn't ease any of the tensions in their old relationships -- or make things run any smoother in their new relationships. Love and Greed (aka Love $ Greed) also features David Charles and Ivan Roth.","popularity":0.2418,"poster_path":"/5R65fTcr9z9jC4RjL3WQcz1a5IN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love $ Greed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":14742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Bruynbroek","original_name":"Frank Bruynbroek","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Robert","credit_id":"52fe4d3e9251416c9110f72f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":58823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Cohen","original_name":"David Cohen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Dr. Organdy","credit_id":"52fe4d3e9251416c9110f737","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mickey Cottrell","original_name":"Mickey Cottrell","popularity":0.1503,"profile_path":"/p9qp6XcXXCgidPxI5tr7T3wANEH.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dr. Basil O'Shea","credit_id":"52fe4d3e9251416c9110f73b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":104419,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lori Eastside","original_name":"Lori Eastside","popularity":0.0941,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Suzie","credit_id":"644b6416596a9105a557b58d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4033222,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudia Kunin","original_name":"Claudia Kunin","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Celestia Fox","credit_id":"644b642851a64e08fcdd286d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":209687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Logan","original_name":"Jason Logan","popularity":0.1043,"profile_path":"/w8C6Qcos5vCveGKQTvs30DK8s4R.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Attorney J.J.
