The scene is laid on an English estate at the edge of a pond. A couple of laborers discover, protruding from the water a pair of female legs. They hasten to the rescue, secure a bench and a long plank so as to get out over the water to the point where the legs are sticking up. Just as they complete their preparations a policeman runs up and insists on going out to the rescue of the female in distress.","popularity":0.3548,"poster_path":"/jHZ21go9oin4RIPsDsABF3P96mw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55222,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mitchell & Kenyon","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1903-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diving Lucy","video":false,"vote_average":3.9,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1037744,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Kenyon","original_name":"James Kenyon","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569e162e9251415e64006bff","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1037745,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sagar Mitchell","original_name":"Sagar Mitchell","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569e1639c3a36858ce006395","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1056050","wikidata_id":"Q16988802","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jHZ21go9oin4RIPsDsABF3P96mw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10121,"name":"stop motion"},{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1903-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1904-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
