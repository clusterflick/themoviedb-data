Anguely V Rayou is another example of these \"youth without future\" films. Based on the novel Two Notebooks by Piotr Kojevnikov, the action takes place in the Leningrad of 1975, when the \"stagnation\" era is at its peak. Two teenagers, Micha and Galia, are experiencing a slow death in the slums of the city. Galia's aunt is going crazy in her desperation. Micha's mother is killed by a drunk. One of their friends has committed suicide. These kids are typical of a generation wasted by alcohol and misfortune. Some are bound to become outcasts, some will be destroyed, and others will be sacrificed in Afghanistan. The title is ironic, as there is neither paradise nor angels in this story.","popularity":0.1335,"poster_path":"/4K73cDLCupRU5XoBPVnFbDPgkKQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1711,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ognon Pictures","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":310,"logo_path":"/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png","name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":105299,"logo_path":"/iI2cFzkMYMLvTgLYWqFQN1Rl3OY.png","name":"Trinity Bridge Studio","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1993-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Angels in Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Des anges au paradis","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4031464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Konstantin Gayokho","original_name":"Konstantin Gayokho","popularity":0.0511,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"644a0e05f794ad04d43cd7bd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4031465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alyona Svintsova","original_name":"Alyona Svintsova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"644a0e11b1131f05471a5f3e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":543366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dinara Drukarova","original_name":"Динара Друкарова","popularity":0.2628,"profile_path":"/toQCnbPVetvd42kL8qPb4biUCOT.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"644a0e1ea76ac504f1b39bc7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrei Tolubeyev","original_name":"Андрей Толубеев","popularity":0.2039,"profile_path":"/tWrvQCjZQuT5aSy21h6meKpdK7K.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"644a0e2be72fe805377ee451","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1175938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Volkova","original_name":"Ольга Волкова","popularity":0.215,"profile_path":"/v2RiUKf27SPhFGho3pqXXZrqUax.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"644a0e41f794ad02fb3cd93e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4031470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valeri Keft","original_name":"Valeri Keft","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"644a0e5ef794ad02fb3cd958","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":240535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zinaida Sharko","original_name":"Зинаида Шарко","popularity":0.1219,"profile_path":"/pfb3uKH1VVdrXS8AgzVwk7CuXKv.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"644a0e65e72fe804b37ee298","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2745365,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Shestov","original_name":"Ivan Shestov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"644a0e7ba39d0b0d1b24535f","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1158866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Tarasenko","original_name":"Olga Tarasenko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"644a0e81a39d0b0cda245275","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4031475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dmitriy Rozin","original_name":"Dmitriy Rozin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"644a0e96a0be2804c9de6441","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2869690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elena Uspenskaya","original_name":"Elena Uspenskaya","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"644a0e9fb1131f05711a5f37","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":566724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimir Kabalin","original_name":"Владимир Кабалин","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/dMrb1BFYzGawLk2MFF0DW4OaTT3.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"655779a17f054018d2476c32","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":558017,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yevgeni Lungin","original_name":"Yevgeni Lungin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d409251416c9110fcb1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0106285","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/4K73cDLCupRU5XoBPVnFbDPgkKQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cannes International Film Festival","release_date":"1993-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
