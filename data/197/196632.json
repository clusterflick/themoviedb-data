Sadly this is one of many Georges Melies films that are only available in a fragment. Hopefully one day a complete print will turn up but until then at least we have this. The film starts off in some sort of bakery as the boss starts giving orders and then a bit later we see a young man pull out a violin he has been hiding and start to play it. The film then flashes to another location but this is where it cuts off so I'm not certain where the story went from here.","popularity":0.1033,"poster_path":"/r3sgTNrg4crbrP8ik3kBFoMMEaH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Star Film","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1908-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Broken Violin","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Broken Violin","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Lully or The Broken Violin","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Méliès","original_name":"Georges Méliès","popularity":0.1982,"profile_path":"/acx5saf22Qj6FV5WAsacRHlZAMn.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d359251416c9110e57f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0223673","wikidata_id":"Q16028657","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8llsAVpH46lwknEHjd7KIUWeu1p.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/r3sgTNrg4crbrP8ik3kBFoMMEaH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1908-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
