The artist is wearing a white shirt over his grey trousers, shirt and necktie, and he is wearing black shoes. With hammer and chisel, he applies the last touches on his last piece of sculpture - The Three Graces, standing nude on a rectangular podium covered with a white bed-shirt. He steps back, contemplates his work, and rejoices on the beauty he has achieved. He goes out momentarily, and brings a bottle of champagne and a glass; before drinking, he makes a toast to his finished statue. He drinks, smokes a cigarette, and contemplates his work - until he falls asleep on the chaise lounge. Only then do The Three Graces stir, and tip-toe around their creator. One even dares to approach her lips to the artist's.","popularity":0.2395,"poster_path":"/1j6EW15diEaheL8NMBnS2lq89CZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":58652,"logo_path":null,"name":"Saturn-Film","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1907-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sculptor's Dream","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Sculptor's Dream","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johann Schwarzer","original_name":"Johann Schwarzer","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d319251416c9110de2d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1032935","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1j6EW15diEaheL8NMBnS2lq89CZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":445,"name":"pornography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1907-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Dream of the Sculptor","key":"R3yiROtUqog","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-12-23T19:21:38.000Z","id":"66839df8c001490b743b02e4"}]}}}
