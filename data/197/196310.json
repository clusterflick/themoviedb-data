Her silken voice and outspoken social awareness wooed music fans and cemented her status as one of the day's most astute and captivating artists. Though 10,000 Maniacs achieved a level of critical success as a major-label act in the mid-80's, Merchant decided to go it alone in 1994. Since then her popularity has bloomed in the wake of Tigerlily, Ophelia, Motherland, Live in Concert: Natalie Merchant and The House Carpenter's Daughter.
