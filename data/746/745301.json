She goes out without makeup, checks hidden cameras when using public restrooms, thinks of domestic violence at the cries of a woman next door, participates in street rallies, and gets hurt by her family’s reaction to the feminist movement. When a Hen Crows is a private essay film exploring the gender identity of a woman in her twenties in Korea using the narration of the director’s diary, referring to herself as a third-person ‘woman.’ Scenes of a family moving show a sense of the home video. Rather than making a clear voice toward the world, the self-reﬂection and sincere gaze look into the subtle movements of internal emotions.","popularity":0.0448,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":116869,"logo_path":null,"name":"DGC","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":140998,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bean Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2020-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When a Hen Crows","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2786878,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dabin","original_name":"Dabin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f72ddf119675700398ff75c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2786878,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dabin","original_name":"Dabin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f68a2c8cee2f600342c463d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":757,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6VWAXESoyi3yFMctGDVHV0AlqPr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1346}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Busan International Film Festival","release_date":"2020-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"#BIFF2020 Wide Angle - When a Hen Crows / 와이드 앵글 - 암탉이 울면","key":"JnLNIS_dWwk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-09-23T09:00:03.000Z","id":"5f6ce31ccb5c8e0038e920b1"}]}}}
