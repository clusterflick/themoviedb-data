From know-it-all parents to annoying teachers and peer pressuring friends, this animated Showtime special offers a flashback to those times when being a kid was a real drag. As the star of the show says: “They ought to pass a law that you’re not allowed to go though childhood until you’re a fully grown adult.”","popularity":2.3452,"poster_path":"/cI5H5keFjBY05b6fayqOGMvwAVe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gahan
