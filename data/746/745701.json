This poignant tragicomic journey of courage follows Mona from early childhood, when she is inculcated to be a quiet, obedient presence in the world. She blossoms into a talented young artist, but years of repressing her feelings have impaired her emotionally, binding her to unhealthy relationships at work and at home. Still, there is a fierce, independent spirit that lies inside her, waiting to be liberated. Assured direction coaxes flawless, seamlessly connected performances from actresses Tanya Zabarylo and Olivia Landuyt in the title role as a young woman and young girl respectively.","popularity":0.4356,"poster_path":"/emUxrV3RVCc48iA19DAyX92Elsf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55968,"logo_path":"/r2lAO54uFXiqmMmURMwlu1RQaJE.png","name":"Submarine","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":11794,"logo_path":"/vjyzeaIhRdtMfDIVGAECNirIkGw.png","name":"Lunanime","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2020-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Becoming
