Kevin is moving to Florida for some odd reason and said he couldn't do the Kevin Steen Show anymore. What better way to go out then having as guests the tag team that has sold more t-shirts than anyone else in the history of indy wrestling, The Young Bucks.  From Matt Rushmore to the Bullet Club, Matt and Nick talk about being in the two most over factions in pro wrestling today. Also, find out why they call Nick the \"Indytaker\" and why you won't see the Young Bucks in DGUSA any time soon.  Spoiler Alert: it's the same reason.  It's appropriate that the Young Bucks were Kevin's first guests nearly two years ago on the Tag Team Edition and also his last guests in his swan song . So, sit back and enjoy as we ride off into the same sunset.","popularity":0.3033,"poster_path":"/sQlOlSLvxfrPqO5IIb2SW4ITyhh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145881,"logo_path":"/e0PDWobzrIHM8OTrzlJCYqfQsks.png","name":"HighSpots","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kevin Steen Show: The Young Bucks Vol. 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1275416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Steen","original_name":"Kevin Steen","popularity":0.5043,"profile_path":"/iUJAMDywPiHcdJ9a3IdrCnYANqa.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f6891bfcee2f600352c6903","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1278218,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Massie","original_name":"Matthew Massie","popularity":0.4924,"profile_path":"/uz5xscEFjFS1t3xf8Pfv1ccFtoi.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Matt Jackson","credit_id":"5f6891cdc1ffbd0036d53f7e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1278219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicholas Massie","original_name":"Nicholas Massie","popularity":0.3168,"profile_path":"/vKx14AofXbkAHaQxZaIzRgZAA44.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Nick Jackson","credit_id":"5f6891dccee2f600362c8d13","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oSARDDOF2LWOrSjzW70PCUDvODB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sQlOlSLvxfrPqO5IIb2SW4ITyhh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2015-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
