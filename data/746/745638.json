Gamberotto is a vegetable import/export merchant. According to the Dynamic website Ernestina is a seductive businesswoman. However when she first appears she drifts about reading a book entitled ‘Love’. Buralicchio becomes an Elvis rocker. Leave the rest of the plot alone, yes, including the castrati part, and you are indeed in the land of the ridiculous. Suspend disbelief? Essential if the plot is to have any relevance.","popularity":0.1123,"poster_path":"/mehBiX9SruCt6plg81Ogyoqmi9U.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122225,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rossini Opera Festival","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2010-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":142,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gioachino Rossini: L'equivoco Stravagante","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1923787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Forsythe","original_name":"Amanda Forsythe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wHBO3k1f1uY3CydfpKy4yArlzSc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f69f34ea6e2d2003958da4c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1410687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruno de Simone","original_name":"Bruno de Simone","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f69f354a0b690003745b378","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1572493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Vinco","original_name":"Marco Vinco","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f69f35afbe36f0039439e0e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1567808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marina Prudenskaja","original_name":"Marina Prudenskaja","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/vjyrRHDCTRpWx1zSehAgOT3veGl.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f69f361dbcade00382ead0d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2787900,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Riccardo Mirabelli","original_name":"Riccardo Mirabelli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f69f367c4ad590038fb8ee4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1123922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dmitry Korchak","original_name":"Dmitry Korchak","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/rqdJ7SmDU3hv0SitHW6FIkpXC8.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5f69f36fa0b69000363b0ae3","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2393192,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Umberto Benedetti Michelangeli","original_name":"Umberto Benedetti Michelangeli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f69f37bcee2f600372fccc8","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1562172,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emilio Sagi","original_name":"Emilio Sagi","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f69f384dbcade003636d4ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mehBiX9SruCt6plg81Ogyoqmi9U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
