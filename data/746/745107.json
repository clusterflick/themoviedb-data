The film is structured as a fast-paced 100-question test and includes appearances by Cory McAbee (The American Astronaut), Frank Conniff (Mystery Science Theater 3000), comedians Lane Moore (Tinder Live) and Dave Hill (Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt), and more. Made on a budget of $5000, the film is packed with visual effects and animation created by director Scott Bateman, who also wrote, composed the music, edited and shot The Bateman Lectures on Depression.","popularity":0.2317,"poster_path":"/isSXJ4CDq5b8tgwI4TdpgLyk2tB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Get out your number two pencil.
