The man’s mostly unsolicited remarks form an unsparing, stitched-together modern-day monologue that alternates between absurd and chilling, reasonable and grotesque. Filmed in Buenos Aires in October 2019, Heinz Emigholz’s spare continuation—and sardonic distillation—of certain themes explored in The Last City is morbid, confrontational, and hilarious.","popularity":0.1854,"poster_path":"/exvkic3r6JYVp0XLsqlhsNadetd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"“There is no Here here.”","title":"The Lobby","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Erdman","original_name":"John Erdman","popularity":0.0613,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Old White Male","credit_id":"5f68d989cee2f600362dc7aa","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":554449,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heinz Emigholz","original_name":"Heinz Emigholz","popularity":0.1601,"profile_path":"/lHMPlkrIiRGV5j1uQyTEON0lhVl.jpg","credit_id":"5f68d9746a2227003a93bb3a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13202854","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":2832,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/exvkic3r6JYVp0XLsqlhsNadetd.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":899,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lCmPV2FtW3bDMuCe59YjKKJ05KJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":597}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New York Film Festival","release_date":"2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
