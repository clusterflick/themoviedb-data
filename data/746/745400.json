However, the man finds the solidarity of two members of the terrorist group Sendero Luminoso, who try to recruit him and his family to join the organization. Although they reject the proposal, the intelligence service members assume the opposite and make the father disappear. His wife and son search for him unsuccessfully in different police stations and barracks.
