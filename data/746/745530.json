Flash memory is from a true story; It is inspired by a Syrian military officer secretly taking out 11,000 photographs documenting the regime's violence against civilians and opponents. Losing his ability to speak as a result of an attack, Ahmet starts working in a unit where people who died in conflicts are photographed and recorded. He wants to announce what he sees to the world, and to give voice to stories stuck in war. He has to choose between protecting himself and his wife or fulfilling his responsibility to humanity.","popularity":0.1307,"poster_path":"/2yQUM4ZCDy3gSqd8STujzhaMNL3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140561,"logo_path":"/nRPMxyAGzhtImTl2u50zx2JApR4.png","name":"Marathon
