Chris Hero's welcome back to the Independent Scene includes an appearance on The Kevin Steen Show. There is no need for the Wikipedia print out on this interview, Kevin and Chris go way back to the dysfunctional days of CZW (which we love talking about) up to the wonderment and magic that is Pro Wrestling Guerrilla. Before we get to all that, Kevin and Chris thoroughly discuss the \"legends\" of Quebec wrestling such as Green Phantom, Iceberg, Face of Death, Razor Revolution and the majestic, Lil Asshole.  Oh yeah, Chris Hero also talks about his time as Kassius Ohno while in NXT and being one of the first groups of development talent to use the brand new Performance Center.","popularity":0.3951,"poster_path":"/tzsk43frKKOgiVOSVmscl8wF6Ii.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145881,"logo_path":"/e0PDWobzrIHM8OTrzlJCYqfQsks.png","name":"HighSpots","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":146,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kevin Steen Show: Chris Hero","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1275416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Steen","original_name":"Kevin Steen","popularity":0.5043,"profile_path":"/iUJAMDywPiHcdJ9a3IdrCnYANqa.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f688e5edbcade00382962ea","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1272138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Spradlin","original_name":"Chris Spradlin","popularity":0.1629,"profile_path":"/8llFi9b8kjFf88ZzyilPZ7NEQoB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Chris Hero","credit_id":"5f688e72a6e2d2003b576b95","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zYshAJ9DKJoGVO7RwHYHUzMQzCw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tzsk43frKKOgiVOSVmscl8wF6Ii.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
