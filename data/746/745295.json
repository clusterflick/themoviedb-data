But the young Gunati suffers from a disease that obstructs menstruation, placing her in a pitiable, degrading situation. She faces a dilemma, when, despite her condition, a young man proposes marriage. The film poignantly conveys Gunati’s alienation and ostracisation, presenting a woman’s perspective in a strictly patriarchal society.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/anfbwHQ8h5JkKOaLHzbMnIMJE70.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2018-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Assamese","iso_639_1":"as","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Barren Bride","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2786857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Prodip Borah","original_name":"Prodip Borah","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f689b8ae267de003514834e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2786858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pradipta Hazarika","original_name":"Pradipta Hazarika","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f689b8f57530e0037b49fe0","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2786859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jadab Mahanta","original_name":"Jadab Mahanta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f689b99c1ffbd0033ce8765","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2786857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Prodip Borah","original_name":"Prodip Borah","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f689ba1a0b690003740b7be","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11328720","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/anfbwHQ8h5JkKOaLHzbMnIMJE70.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Film Bazaar","release_date":"2018-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow International Film Festival","release_date":"2020-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
