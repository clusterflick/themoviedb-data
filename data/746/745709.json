The show tells the story of Howard, who is having trouble producing his fantasy musical review because of constant set backs, a disagreeable cast and technical problems. In addition, he is haunted by the discouraging words of his high school guidance counselor, Miss Roundhole, who told him he would work in the theater “when pigs fly.” As Howard tries to navigates the evening of skits and songs, he learns that the problem isn’t that he has “gone too far,” but instead has not gone far enough. The show closes with an unbelievable drag showgirl finale reminiscent of Beach Blanket Babylon and Ziegfield’s Follies.","popularity":0.0629,"poster_path":"/eOoe7QrILFIt3V3TIYMODf5d52O.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":136773,"logo_path":null,"name":"Short North Stage","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Pigs Fly","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2788087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jiovanni Daniel","original_name":"Jiovanni Daniel","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Howard","credit_id":"5f6a2b38a0b69000363b8aba","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2788088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zachary Bigelow","original_name":"Zachary Bigelow","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Zachary","credit_id":"5f6a2b42c4ad590037fafe2a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2788089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luke Bovenizer","original_name":"Luke Bovenizer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Luke","credit_id":"5f6a2b4ce267de0033154154","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2788090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Hardin","original_name":"Nick Hardin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Nick","credit_id":"5f6a2b5be627190037fe97c0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1720319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thom Christopher Warren","original_name":"Thom Christopher Warren","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Thom","credit_id":"5f6a2b63c4ad590036fdab40","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2631149,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina West","original_name":"Nina West","popularity":0.072,"profile_path":"/qz6g7CBhDhZuOmhdE9bIkq9OfAa.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Guest Artist","credit_id":"5f6a2b97dbcade003637f98b","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2788096,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jerri Shafer","original_name":"Jerri Shafer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6a2bcce627190037fe99c4","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2788094,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jonathan Parks","original_name":"Jonathan Parks","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6a2bb9c4ad590036fdabf3","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2702775,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward Carignan","original_name":"Edward Carignan","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6a2ba5a0b69000363b8b91","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2702775,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward Carignan","original_name":"Edward Carignan","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6a2baec4ad590036fdabe2","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1545,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eOoe7QrILFIt3V3TIYMODf5d52O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1030}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
