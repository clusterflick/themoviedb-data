With testimonies and images of historical and sentimental value, journalist Jayme Martins and his family lead us to a comprehension of China through the unprecedented narrative of his experience in that country: Communism, Mao’s Cultural Revolution, the Celestial Peace Square Massacre, the reforms that culminated with the country becoming a superpower.
