Santiago, who called himself a permanent traveler through history, registered the most significant facts of his time, from the Cuban Revolution to the disintegration of the Soviet Block. He took to spectators from all continents a counterpoint to the history narrated by the United States Information Service, USIS. Through his works, we dive into the Cuban political and cultural scene, the tensions of Latin America, the Vietnam War, the countless conflicts for African independence, always with a peripheral look that is characteristic of his cinema, currently converted into a memory of a world in transformation.","popularity":0.1414,"poster_path":"/pWY0XOvui2SzpctO4mtIirRgsFt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2019-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Santiago das Américas ou o Olho do Terceiro Mundo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1062869,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Orlando Senna","original_name":"Orlando Senna","popularity":0.0999,"profile_path":"/52I9V7hAq7tTNgALXQ56rjRuEF0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"himself","credit_id":"5f7894b33429ff0038b22f71","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1414299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfredo Guevara","original_name":"Alfredo Guevara","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"himself","credit_id":"5f78abded4d50900330a9729","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chico Diaz","original_name":"Chico Díaz","popularity":0.2178,"profile_path":"/75vzoB7Pm2RXTRI9f1S8BZRtJQP.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"narração","credit_id":"5f78ca01021cee003731c8b5","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3259965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ricardo Moreira","original_name":"Ricardo Moreira","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615caec0a33612004333b85b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1138622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Silvio Tendler","original_name":"Silvio Tendler","popularity":0.0595,"profile_path":"/wDhgT6rFtzmzLvmFHqFjPeY9iZd.jpg","credit_id":"5f6adb93e267de0034212d9b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2802147,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lilia Souza Diniz","original_name":"Lilia Souza Diniz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f78c9c8197de40038734396","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2747786,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tao Burity","original_name":"Tao Burity","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f78c9d1197de40036732e07","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2747785,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maycon Almeida","original_name":"Maycon Almeida","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f78c9db944a5739d0c73f8b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1138622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Silvio Tendler","original_name":"Silvio Tendler","popularity":0.0595,"profile_path":"/wDhgT6rFtzmzLvmFHqFjPeY9iZd.jpg","credit_id":"5f78c9e91d019100399a4481","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14658418","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pWY0XOvui2SzpctO4mtIirRgsFt.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"É Tudo Verdade - Festival Internacional de Documentários","release_date":"2020-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
