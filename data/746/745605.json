Events make an absurd, surreal, maybe a dadaist turn after which to reach her objectives, Aino and her peers are obliged to search for the answer to the mysteries of the modern human condition. Thus follows a satirical, antimodernist continuum of monologues, mixed-media footage and introductions of modern subjectivity. The film is a flight through the darker sides of fossil-fueled European rationalism, shedding light on techno-capitalist-individualist age of modern alienation, hauntological nostalgies of imagined futures, the profound problematics of translating human communication, the post-human sides of Jean Sibelius – and finally – the reindeers of the north.","popularity":0.179,"poster_path":"/649HfenomVw30fHEZhUROBakp3M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2019-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sibelius Continuum","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Sibelius-jatkumo","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Sibelius-continuum","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2787769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aino Johansson","original_name":"Aino Johansson","popularity":0.0923,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f69d1c4a0b69000393efa5d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1904562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aksa Korttila","original_name":"Aksa Korttila","popularity":0.116,"profile_path":"/fegP82NlLERM2bBi6Gt4r0P0EqU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f69d1cae267de003216c609","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228650,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timo Torikka","original_name":"Timo Torikka","popularity":0.102,"profile_path":"/6mt2zA5ry5gi5FmahjBKt4fDNch.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f69d1d0c4ad590039fa9ded","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tapio Liinoja","original_name":"Tapio Liinoja","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f69d1d6dbcade0036363c06","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heikki Metsämäki","original_name":"Heikki Metsämäki","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f69d1ddfbe36f0038479776","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2787770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Tuomi","original_name":"Laura Tuomi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5f69d1e4e267de00341c1c5a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2787771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Pemberton","original_name":"Olga Pemberton","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5f69d1ecfbe36f00374a92b3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2787772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Synes Elischka","original_name":"Synes Elischka","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5f69d1f2a0b69000393efac9","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2787773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Dewald","original_name":"Walter Dewald","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5f69d1f7fbe36f00384797a2","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1919531,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aarni Vaarnamo","original_name":"Aarni Vaarnamo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f69d200688cd000361d77bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1919531,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aarni Vaarnamo","original_name":"Aarni Vaarnamo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f69d204c1ffbd0035d69c04","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14440090","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fi","file_path":"/649HfenomVw30fHEZhUROBakp3M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
