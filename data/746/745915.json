It is a tapestry of history and art, drawn from major artworks and photos from the defining conflicts of their times. This immense visual collage allows the audience to navigate through time and place, meeting survivors of these horrific moments in history and the artists who have created work commenting on these periods, some of which have become iconic. Through Kelly’s drawings, the audience is transported to the concentration camps of the Third Reich, the bombing of Hiroshima, “the troubles” in Ireland, the race riots in the US and Pol Pot’s Year Zero. Interwoven with archival footage of these cataclysmic events, the audience is invited to visit anti-war and anti-gun demonstrations today, events that call for similar injustices to be stopped. The film is a parallel work to Kelly’s masterpiece, unfolding to create the ‘Big Picture’ in documentary form.","popularity":0.4469,"poster_path":"/qitZRneDylLkg48lK7fXCMhIRpH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Can Art Stop a Bullet: William Kelly's Big Picture","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"¿Puede el arte detener una bala?","type":"documental"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Sheen","original_name":"Martin Sheen","popularity":1.2177,"profile_path":"/m2Y3Q0uyuW6htrn2W9UWCWMkpZu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f6ae542a7e36300372517ed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2788716,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Kelly","original_name":"William Kelly","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f6ae568cee2f6003732b434","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2796193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Ut","original_name":"Nick Ut","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f72e9dd196757003896d5ba","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2796194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rama Mani","original_name":"Rama Mani","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f72ea05ef48890037f7de4d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2788721,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Street","original_name":"Mark Street","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6ae59fe267de0034216987","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2796189,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Terry Cantwell","original_name":"Terry Cantwell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f72e91f1f748b00392c3c98","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1112579,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fiona Cochrane","original_name":"Fiona Cochrane","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f72e8f9fea0d700360329e0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2563631,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Daniela Raulli","original_name":"Daniela Raulli","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f72e93f1d78f200346c4c2b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2796191,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Muir","original_name":"David Muir","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f72e963d38b580038eb7695","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10098048","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qitZRneDylLkg48lK7fXCMhIRpH.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/t6DRzPFsRUM5Pg0KJh6QOB6aie7.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":522}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2339,"name":"political activism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"William Kelly's: Can Art Stop A Bullet.
