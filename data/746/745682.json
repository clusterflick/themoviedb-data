We walk through the block of apartments in the Barrio de las Flores in A Coruña, promoted by the Obra Sindical do Hogar in the 1960s. A project for which the architect J.A. Corrales, receives the national prize of architecture in the 2001.  Filmed in 16mm, the film travels consecutively through all the rooms and halls of a group of houses, starting with the residual spaces of the building until it reaches its roof, while it gets dark with the city in the background.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/gqyROToW1FHT1mQCNcIap7Vmxn6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unidade Veciñal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2057304,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tono Mejuto","original_name":"Tono Mejuto","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6a12ebcee2f6003634c338","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1078,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gqyROToW1FHT1mQCNcIap7Vmxn6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
