The only problem is: he never bothered to tell Bethany. In fact, Andy's never even spoken to her. But with the prom only twenty-four hours away, he's not going to let a little thing like that get him down. He's got bigger problems. Mainly the fact that America is on the brink of a nuclear war that not only threatens to destroy the free world, but his prom night as well.","popularity":0.2065,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"All's fair in love and nuclear war","title":"Armageddon for Andy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2787855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Griffin","original_name":"Edward Griffin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Andy","credit_id":"5f69e3adc4ad590039fac5c6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":68611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emme Rylan","original_name":"Emme Rylan","popularity":0.187,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Bethany Hopkins","credit_id":"5f69e3c2a0b69000384ceed4","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1492938,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc Dworkin","original_name":"Marc Dworkin","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f69e30da0b69000384cebbd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2231840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eugene Lehnert","original_name":"Eugene Lehnert","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f69e33aa0b69000384cebf1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1492938,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc Dworkin","original_name":"Marc Dworkin","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f69e356dbcade0039212083","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1522408","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
