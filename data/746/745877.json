Her ability to hunt moose is hindered by two pressing issues – scarce wildlife and the pressures of high school life. Finding sufficient food competes with track practice and homework in Jewel’s multilayered world. Along with her father, Jewel turns to the land to feed their family and finds that their village’s way of life is endangered by the same environmental shifts that could affect us all. In hunting moose, we see that Jewel is also hunting for answers. How will her village survive if subsistence hunting is threatened? Can she honor the traditions of her Elders while navigating the pressures and anxieties of a modern, connected teenager? \"Jewel’s Hunt\" proves to be both physical and philosophical in this insightful exploration of what it means to come of age in complicated times in Unalakleet, Alaska.","popularity":0.502,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jewel’s
