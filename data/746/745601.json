With a few changes and alterations to the original music, this version was first performed in 1857 at the Paris Opera.  A light show unique to the stage director unfolds in the cold architecture, creating the perfect framing for Verdi’s music, dramatic and dark in this timeless opera.","popularity":0.1482,"poster_path":"/533Cz8oEgG2INefEOKUEpfvpdNx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":174,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Trouvère","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2706995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giuseppe Gipali","original_name":"Giuseppe Gipali","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f69cfd15f2db1003440987a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franco Vassallo","original_name":"Franco Vassallo","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/xGdVi5bryDF6DkD1BArlmyq3vTF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f69cfd9e267de00341c1653","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1559059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Spotti","original_name":"Marco Spotti","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/qpQDUTWmmR1QUkRRZnIAr78HmDy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f69cfe0c4ad590036fbdb06","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1565310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luca Casalin","original_name":"Luca Casalin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f69cfe8cee2f60036336314","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2787765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberta Mantegna","original_name":"Roberta Mantegna","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f69cfef688cd000371eb060","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1461603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nino Surguladze","original_name":"Nino Surguladze","popularity":0.0716,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5f69cff7cee2f60035312900","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1421776,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Roberto Abbado","original_name":"Roberto Abbado","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f69d005dbcade0036363075","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1169226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Wilson","original_name":"Robert Wilson","popularity":0.1229,"profile_path":"/c2NHsGT1n1QmHlWkVKKzZ7Wy4Pm.jpg","credit_id":"5f69d011a0b69000384c9d30","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/533Cz8oEgG2INefEOKUEpfvpdNx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
