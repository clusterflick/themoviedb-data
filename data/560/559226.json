Of course Daddy will never allow. On the contrary he wants to force his daughter to marry his business partner, a single man, whose money would be a welcome help. To escape such an unfortunate lot, Christiane must find a subterfuge. The solution is Bichon, the baby that Jacques, her younger brother, is supposed to have had from a certain Loulou. By claiming that the baby is hers and that Augustin is the father, she hopes to compel her father not to marry a man she does not love.","popularity":0.0865,"poster_path":"/j9dmyzkVeSo9ZvtodSHzPJVX5UQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1948-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bichon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":239223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Armand
