On the way, we meet an extraordinary family, a father who trains his son and the most passionate fans in boxing. The film is set against the backdrop of one city; Leeds. Half aspirational professionals and students, half austerity ravaged estates, Leeds is a schizophrenic metaphor for England in 2016. Our boxer bridges the two because this is a city in need of a hero. Can he match and fulfil their hopes and dreams?","popularity":0.1751,"poster_path":"/6PudtmdQBn2GoBSfkuQEZe9hIdU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148894,"logo_path":"/5an0hahm40POymfNsytcxyqr6lG.png","name":"Splice Post","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fighting For A City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1761155,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Duncan Western","original_name":"Duncan Western","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646fcdc6336e01012acf1c61","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2171179,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacob Proud","original_name":"Jacob Proud","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be467efc3a36810d202f473","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8517704","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6PudtmdQBn2GoBSfkuQEZe9hIdU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":809}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Josh Warrington: Fighting for a City Official Trailer (2018)","key":"sXpOq0_46Fs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-10-24T16:51:18.000Z","id":"5d21e08f7eb5f200114e7e6a"}]}}}
