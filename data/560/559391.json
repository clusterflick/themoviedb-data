The World as we knew it no longer exists. When the father accidentally shoots a stranger while on a hunt, he sees himself faced with only two options. At home, Marie tends the wounds of the unconscious man. While the father distrusts the stranger, Marie is drawn to him. For her, the bunker feels not like a home but a prison from which she yearns to break free. Can this stranger be her long awaited hope? But when a group of marauders invade the bunker, Marie is not sure who her new friend really is.","popularity":0.2633,"poster_path":"/ru4fGL2A2WuJ2ZIsEUGP5Dr2Opc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110942,"logo_path":null,"name":"Friendship
