Suddenly a caravan rounded the corner, scattering the protesters. Klansmen and Nazis emerged from the cars, unloaded an arsenal of guns and began firing. Five people were killed in what became known as the Greensboro Massacre.  Greensboro: Closer to the Truth reconnects 25 years later with the players in this tragedy—widowed and wounded survivors, along with their attackers—and chronicles how their lives have evolved in the long aftermath of the killings. All converge when the first Truth and Reconciliation Commission ever held in the United States is convened in Greensboro from 2004-2006 to investigate the Massacre. As the Commission struggles to uncover what actually happened and why, the participants confront the truth of their past, and struggle with the possibility of hope and redemption.","popularity":0.3094,"poster_path":"/4LbEwSEHUsBuEzWo4l1sgAjsZb0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110995,"logo_path":null,"name":"Longnook Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Truth in Greensboro","title":"Greensboro: Closer to the Truth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389896,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adam Zucker","original_name":"Adam Zucker","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5be265cd9251415c7700a5b1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":213605,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sheldon Mirowitz","original_name":"Sheldon Mirowitz","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be1c0979251414df100fca2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2169903,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Scott Anger","original_name":"Scott Anger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be1c07d0e0a263d7a01019b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389896,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adam Zucker","original_name":"Adam Zucker","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be1c02fc3a36809e600e881","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389896,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adam Zucker","original_name":"Adam Zucker","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be1c01f0e0a263d8400fcad","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389896,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adam Zucker","original_name":"Adam Zucker","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be1c00fc3a36809fb0116a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126162,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Richard Hankin","original_name":"Richard Hankin","popularity":0.0693,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be1c0b79251414df800fa42","department":"Writing","job":"Story Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0995820","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"Greensboro-Closer-to-the-Truth-92745443417","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4LbEwSEHUsBuEzWo4l1sgAjsZb0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":40870,"name":"race"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"DVD","release_date":"2007-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Greensboro: Closer to the Truth","key":"Y26FNVsCJ50","published_at":"2009-05-08T20:58:15.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5be1c1ed9251414df800fbbc"}]}}}
