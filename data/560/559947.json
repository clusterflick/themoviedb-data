Helena Dietrich designed the textile figures with Janneke Raaphorst, based on one-on-one sessions with various guests. In these discussions, they investigated their personal perceptions of their own bodies. Does your personality completely coincide with this body and everything surrounding it? And if you change it in any way, do you change too? You literally inhabit an imaginary body and thus have the time to explore your own identity in an uninhibited, sensory, intuitive way.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/uXdxsbTsnaLwO3kMcX73Y4GOObA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70653,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kaaitheater","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2018-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elastic Habitat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2103040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irina Lavrinovič","original_name":"Irina Lavrinovič","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/rV1UjR1q8xRgpDIeo16tFolLJcz.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5be2bfabc3a36810ca0123c3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2170366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esta Matković","original_name":"Esta Matković","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/7MdmF5oSsHBO6Chza5AQmoFloAJ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5be2bfc30e0a2614b6011275","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2170368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julien Bruneau","original_name":"Julien Bruneau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5be2bfd30e0a2614b3010fe5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2170369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helena Dietrich","original_name":"Helena Dietrich","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5be2bfdc0e0a2614ba010ba8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2170371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janneke Raaphorst","original_name":"Janneke Raaphorst","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5be2bff09251415c7a00f83b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2170372,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lili Mihaijlovic","original_name":"Lili Mihaijlovic","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5be2c00a0e0a2614bf010766","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2170373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dolores Hulan","original_name":"Dolores Hulan","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5be2c017c3a36810d20108fb","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2170369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helena Dietrich","original_name":"Helena Dietrich","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be2c0290e0a2614b1010b59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2170369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helena Dietrich","original_name":"Helena Dietrich","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be2c0339251415c75010225","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2170371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janneke Raaphorst","original_name":"Janneke Raaphorst","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be2c0530e0a2614c3011646","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2170371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janneke Raaphorst","original_name":"Janneke Raaphorst","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be2c05d0e0a2614c301164c","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2170374,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mathieu Hendriks","original_name":"Mathieu Hendriks","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be2c080c3a36810d201094b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9244514","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uXdxsbTsnaLwO3kMcX73Y4GOObA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
