But she has a dream: she wants to become a star. One day the Orient Express, which never stops at the little station across the café she works in, is forced to pull up due to a technical incident. And out of a carriage gets ... a company of dancers, who start rehearsing before Edith's amazed eyes. She meets the director of the company, handsome dancing star Harry Belmont, who takes an interest in her beauty and in her natural talent. When she leaves her obnoxious father for Vienna, Harry is absent. She nearly gets seduced by a libidinous man but, after a narrow escape, she gets a job from Treberg, the owner of the restaurant she had dined in. Treberg finds her there, hires her as a dancer and the pair soon meets tremendous success. A star is born but, realizing that he comes second to her, he prefers to vanish.","popularity":0.4091,"poster_path":"/oyeUstV1uhi8hVaLwZVwVurv00w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":202251,"logo_path":null,"name":"Berna-Filmproduktion","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":25755,"logo_path":null,"name":"Donau-Filmproduktion","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":202250,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arta Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1949-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'inconnu d'un soir","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Rouleau","original_name":"Raymond Rouleau","popularity":0.1256,"profile_path":"/aZEHDDXKKt54D6w7Qco20hhUGhE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"620e75639ecf180043932a3d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadia Gray","original_name":"Nadia Gray","popularity":0.2438,"profile_path":"/zY6Zy7rgunfj8BLYXn2dA8NlBnr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Édith","credit_id":"620e75696840cc001c33c1ab","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claude Dauphin","original_name":"Claude Dauphin","popularity":0.2269,"profile_path":"/1Phmm4zdV1gX3R3Gbjz5W4m2DBq.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"620e757170309f006b463123","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Berri","original_name":"Robert Berri","popularity":0.1684,"profile_path":"/pDw3Al7ysvnaMAswDSopgy2BGq6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"620e7578f794ad0042440bd2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":24884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucienne Legrand","original_name":"Lucienne Legrand","popularity":0.2231,"profile_path":"/31BZZj4j3DhavI841MgFHqCt7bS.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"620e76fd1ad93b001d5542a0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"René Génin","original_name":"René Génin","popularity":0.1644,"profile_path":"/mRzt00oih1TH0rNvHpoatebESBX.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"620e758ef794ad0042440c0d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":277503,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Fonteney","original_name":"Catherine Fonteney","popularity":0.102,"profile_path":"/8Kug9poJiIDMUwxHZNs00h1LbtT.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"620e771ff794ad001bac486b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2657494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Palenc","original_name":"Max Palenc","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"620e77241ad93b001d554303","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1121837,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nicolas Farkas","original_name":"Nicolas Farkas","popularity":0.0584,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668fdb18ed292d409ee6a7bb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590738,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Karl Farkas","original_name":"Karl Farkas","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668fdb049cdde63b83b6339e","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1277558,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"André Legrand","original_name":"André Legrand","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668fdb0d590c1b7424d52c5e","department":"Writing","job":"Adaptation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1397400,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Siegfried Bernfeld","original_name":"Siegfried Bernfeld","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668fdafb5989cc18afb63356","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28244,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hervé Bromberger","original_name":"Hervé Bromberger","popularity":0.054,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bdfbc45c3a3682b27034289","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590582,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Max Neufeld","original_name":"Max Neufeld","popularity":0.2433,"profile_path":"/wufLoROapJZi1WBWkRhMG4gr7kT.jpg","credit_id":"5bdfbc4ec3a3682b2703429b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0207532","wikidata_id":"Q21427423","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.74,"height":1023,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oyeUstV1uhi8hVaLwZVwVurv00w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":757}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1949-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
