During his approximately ten years as a dancer, Vaslav Nijinsky (1889-1950) set a new standard both technically and expressively, while in his choreographic work he pointed the way towards modern dance. All three aspects - the dancer, the choreographer and the person Nijinsky - form the starting point for John Neumeiers latest creation. Neumeier, who as early as 1979 presented a short ballet Vaslav, is regarded as one of the leading Nijinsky experts worldwide.","popularity":0.0599,"poster_path":"/a9GCxmXgvwKi51FbkV4IDEvFiAw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nijinsky","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2170444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandre Riabko","original_name":"Alexandre Riabko","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/2tfuo9L1PFHg9cK6KiV4fJXTiQN.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5be2f94e0e0a2614bf014644","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2170445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carolina Agüero","original_name":"Carolina Agüero","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5be2f958c3a36810bf0154be","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2170446,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Friza","original_name":"Patricia Friza","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5be2f95ec3a36810bf0154d1","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188766,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"John Neumeier","original_name":"John Neumeier","popularity":0.0625,"profile_path":"/mAKpaiKDisBlWbmnQu6xXFxJosn.jpg","credit_id":"5be2f96a9251415c82012f76","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1272,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a9GCxmXgvwKi51FbkV4IDEvFiAw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":848}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
