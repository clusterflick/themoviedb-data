One of the problems of filmed live ballet is the video presentation often fails to capture the experience of being in the theatre, something this dynamic production shot on location and in the studio circumvents in a highly visual way. Relocating Hoffman's tale of Doctor Coppelia's automaton and troubled young love to contemporary run-down urban France, the opening folk-dances are set around a hard-court game of football which unequivocally evokes the opening of West Side Story (1961).","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/dclsQlnDDK47xynpR8Guz20da79.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coppelia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2169714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Françoise Joullie","original_name":"Françoise Joullie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5be1965f0e0a263d7700d4e4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2169715,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josu Zabala","original_name":"Josu Zabala","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5be19666c3a3680a0200d7ff","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2169716,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nerses Boyadjian","original_name":"Nerses Boyadjian","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5be1966c9251414df800cbd3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1724234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Brown","original_name":"Maria Brown","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5be19680c3a36809e600ba21","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dclsQlnDDK47xynpR8Guz20da79.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
