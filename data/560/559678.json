Instead, he decides to go on holiday with his newly married wife but the trip , due to his grim mood, is no bed of roses. In Juan-lès-Pins they finally meet Charles, who is so infatuated with Anita that he has forgotten to meet his old friend Henri Poupon, the Meridional actor. Thanks to cheerful Charles and to the sunny climate, Georges relaxes and things improve in his relationships with his wife.
