H. Auden and Chester Kallman, inspired by a series of 18th century prints by William Hogarth. This amazing production from La Monnaie De Munt jazzifies the setting by replacing Hogarth's sin city, London, with 1950s Las Vegas, turning it into a glittering, cinematic gallery of tableaux vivants inspired by the early days of television. Staged by one of the most visionary theatre directors of our age, the Québécois Robert Lepage, the neo-classical morality tale truly becomes a grand spectacle. Lepage's visual imagination works its magic superbly, while Kazushi Ono's energetic musical direction drives the sparkling ensemble to exhilarating heights. Recorded in High Definition and true surround sound.","popularity":0.1243,"poster_path":"/eI3NeyWhjG5e0UPtzIpAIKbbi80.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4775,"logo_path":"/z1HSU7AQ04jeOICLE1mBzEJxiEJ.png","name":"Opus Arte","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":171,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stravinsky: The Rake's Progress","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2168651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Kennedy","original_name":"Andrew Kennedy","popularity":0.048,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Tom Rakewell","credit_id":"5be014890e0a26059303ce60","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2168653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Claycomb","original_name":"Laura Claycomb","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Anne Trulove","credit_id":"5be01494c3a3682b270396e1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Shimell","original_name":"William Shimell","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/w5LOSXe2Wtul1sUWVWpw8d7WHP6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Nick Shadow","credit_id":"5be0149cc3a3682b270396ea","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1885336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dagmar Pecková","original_name":"Dagmar Pecková","popularity":0.0754,"profile_path":"/aXsgZEdrBx00pQyouij8aVNdGRs.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Baba the Turk","credit_id":"5be014a40e0a26057e03c2fe","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4650336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julianne Young","original_name":"Julianne Young","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Mother Goose","credit_id":"661a134e93db92014a0b073d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38527,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Lepage","original_name":"Robert Lepage","popularity":0.2823,"profile_path":"/cgPCsNrKLuRVQ0IwuIHmdje1N7H.jpg","credit_id":"5ff975c0ed28b9004174165a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1461425","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eI3NeyWhjG5e0UPtzIpAIKbbi80.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
