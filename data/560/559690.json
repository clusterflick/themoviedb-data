White spots on dark skin have set her aside from others. Weird, sympathetic, penetrating ‘normal’ eye sights have made her feel guilty and embarrassed for who she is and how she looks.One fine day a young and vibrant teacher joins her school. A fine young man with strong belief in freedom and self-pride, he creates space for Namrata to breathe freely. She finds solace in his gaze, relief in his presence. Her isolated bubble is about to dissolve in ether. Romance is kindling teenage desires. Too much at stake, too much to lose…. Destinations seem far away, but the journey prevails…the complexes, the taboos, the inner conflicts are about to resolve…making her in to a different being altogether.","popularity":0.0962,"poster_path":"/vp8zSSeKKMuynAqANEMCXPDWHDj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Marathi","iso_639_1":"mr","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Imago","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2269467,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aishwarya Ghaydar","original_name":"Aishwarya Ghaydar","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c9250160e0a2612fc5d5de7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2149591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amol Deshmukh","original_name":"Amol Deshmukh","popularity":0.1033,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c925021925141409fa5edd6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2269469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adarsh Kurne","original_name":"Adarsh Kurne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5c925029c3a368611f533052","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2269470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vishwas Kamble","original_name":"Vishwas Kamble","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5c925031c3a36874064d5ebb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2269471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neha Awati","original_name":"Neha Awati","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5c92503a9251410ff4a89604","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2269472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amaraja Patil","original_name":"Amaraja Patil","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5c925044c3a36874064d5ed8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2269474,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rinkle Chopde","original_name":"Rinkle Chopde","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5c92504e0e0a2613045deceb","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2269475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shreyas Gurav","original_name":"Shreyas Gurav","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5c9250580e0a2612ed5d4db5","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2169543,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karan Chavan","original_name":"Karan Chavan","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be152939251414df800820f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2169544,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vikram Patil","original_name":"Vikram Patil","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be152a2c3a3680a000086d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9627240","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":808,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vp8zSSeKKMuynAqANEMCXPDWHDj.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":539},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sJ9Y2cz6VwKvNiSnIeJ4fCwkA5r.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"mr","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Imago | Jio MAMI 20th Mumbai Film Festival with Star","key":"nqsoq0Vhs2A","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-10-24T05:34:28.000Z","id":"5c9251a40e0a2612fc5d606f"}]}}}
