He once lived alone with his son Juste, who helped him to farm the Mauvents land. One night Noguère fired at a couple of trespassers, hurting the girl and killing her fiancé. Giving Catoune, the girl, the shelter of his home, Noguère was forced - however reluctantly it may have been - to break the bad news to the fiancée. For all that Catoune recovered, settled down and later married Juste. After a while Juste left for the war and was soon reported missing. Noguère comforted the distressed young woman so well that she became her mistress. But Juste had not been killed.","popularity":0.3558,"poster_path":"/wDNICFpWtiN7Wt3pz2WyFWqGLSO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1952-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Malaire","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Tempête sur les Mauvents","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Vanel","original_name":"Charles Vanel","popularity":0.2808,"profile_path":"/dznVyOfBuL2cTDucr0xOpzp6iGT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62140aa30cd44600692d0d20","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arturo Marín","original_name":"Arturo Marín","popularity":0.1498,"profile_path":"/bg3zcrkjP178483YgpshdbgXr1P.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"62140abb383df2006bbe823c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":585366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrée Debar","original_name":"Andrée Debar","popularity":0.1493,"profile_path":"/5kL9knF6pb7iXHmQusuEHulSAFr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62140aa7a39d0b006c1d4d9c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1011123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francisco Arenzana","original_name":"Francisco Arenzana","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":"/pNW1KTKGE4DcqMIredfYdW9ZLE5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"62140ab63f4833001c9b54b7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1749248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfonso de Córdoba","original_name":"Alfonso de Córdoba","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"62140ac40499f2001bbc6c86","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuel Guitián","original_name":"Manuel Guitián","popularity":0.0771,"profile_path":"/jr7QH6M4GMLns8VJ4IEaDIheRAD.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"62140acee640d6006d58d21c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1820210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuel Alcón","original_name":"Manuel Alcón","popularity":0.0564,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"62140ad8b84cdd006e5a3ab7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joaquín Bergía","original_name":"Joaquín Bergía","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":"/6rT4mkfF4oIZXnux6jFK0HgKdCc.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"62140ae11a3248001c4a6b66","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2918155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benito Cobeña","original_name":"Benito Cobeña","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"62140aeb470ead00440c0a03","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1179858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugenio Domingo","original_name":"Eugenio Domingo","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":"/tZxvxKCpPdJeNJ0cZxJ7ljfRtmR.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"62140af30b5fd600690bb179","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3437799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"D.
