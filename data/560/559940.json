When Rudolf Nureyev asked set designer Petrika Ionesco to work on his forthcoming ballet, he did not expect him to give such an innovative arrangement of Perrault's or Petipa's Cinderella. Still, after a hostile reaction, the choreographer was seduced by the idea. Because in essence, the \"topic\" was preserved, although modernized. A young woman is victimized by a morbid family, and her only wish is to escape the oppressive world in which she lives. One day, her kindness is rewarded: while she runs to help a person who needs help, she changes her destiny forever. This character, who embodies the fairy in Perrault's tale, is a Hollywood producer... And this is how Nureyev turns the film star into a modern prince charming.","popularity":0.1603,"poster_path":"/aXLfmQv4jj1uAzlV5s04z0qKUSH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinderella - Prokofiev","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agnès Letestu","original_name":"Agnès Letestu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5be2b5930e0a2614bf00fc0a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Martinez","original_name":"José Martinez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5be2b59d0e0a2614ba010174","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1318545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laëtitia Pujol","original_name":"Laëtitia Pujol","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/hoYPrvPkgxQLhzsVUAL5DeKRAkt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5be2b5a4c3a36810d200fc4b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1193775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stéphanie Romberg","original_name":"Stéphanie Romberg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5be2b5ac9251415c6900fa6c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1559990,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Stéphane Phavorin","original_name":"Stéphane Phavorin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5be2b5b40e0a2614b101009b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2923085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paris Opera Orchestra","original_name":"Paris Opera Orchestra","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff9154c383df2003d3362c9","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v5OsShERU5no6d8u9fBlrEyrUIc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aXLfmQv4jj1uAzlV5s04z0qKUSH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
