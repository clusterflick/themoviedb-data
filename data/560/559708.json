She’s accomplished quite a bit in her life, but after her younger sister announces she is pregnant, Holly decides she is going to make an effort to meet Mr. Right. Meanwhile, David, another professor, is a single father, very smart and kind, but not the type that Holly takes notice of when the two are assigned to plan the Christmas Formal. At the insistence of her best friend, Holly signs up for the dating website “Cupid’s Arrow,” where she meets Josh, an attorney just hired by the school. He’s everything she wants on the surface, but has little to say beyond his work and good looks. Josh and David were roommates in college, so Josh recruits David to write poetic messages in an attempt to win Holly over.","popularity":1.0535,"poster_path":"/dzCM6jmBCnSwWgiFuUKGnQAyJB4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6345,"logo_path":"/7SriqZDgcJB67Mf3L2G9uum85Hl.png","name":"Lighthouse Pictures","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Holly, a single college professor, signs up for an online dating service, but begins to grow suspicious when the guy's beautifully-written texts don't match his actions.","title":"Christmas Cupid's Arrow","video":false,"vote_average":5.167,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Christmas Cupid","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":78197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisabeth Harnois","original_name":"Elisabeth Harnois","popularity":0.5597,"profile_path":"/yq9H8T5urAGhzvEBxbw4gBjvDN2.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Holly","credit_id":"5be176089251414dee009fdf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Togo","original_name":"Jonathan Togo","popularity":0.478,"profile_path":"/s6SVfTHfn4VLXmsl8l3QjJzpako.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"David","credit_id":"5be1761a9251414de900a300","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chad Michael Collins","original_name":"Chad Michael Collins","popularity":1.046,"profile_path":"/9lcEpAYRBCylYIVMZYXHqfmRzfP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Josh","credit_id":"5be1762a9251414df800ab20","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":212985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sasha Jackson","original_name":"Sasha Jackson","popularity":0.5305,"profile_path":"/e1dVUW0ch27YdavOKI9F8XZwt1W.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Emily Devine","credit_id":"5be17637c3a3680a0000b2c5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcus Lyle Brown","original_name":"Marcus Lyle Brown","popularity":0.2603,"profile_path":"/zHsqlROpMRsvtW70bgbkSEqakCd.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Sean Devine","credit_id":"5c0951c30e0a2638d301e1e4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77808,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Randy Charach","original_name":"Randy Charach","popularity":0.1265,"profile_path":"/kztbkYvm8QU8WFvf5BxDAJwvSFs.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Dr. Wendell","credit_id":"5c0951d0925141479201cb43","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1613974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Regina Ting Chen","original_name":"Regina Ting Chen","popularity":0.2566,"profile_path":"/7Lqwq6UYbZd7XyMujUKUVUHGSIb.jpg","cast_id":21,"character":"Cori Johnson","credit_id":"5c0951dd0e0a2638af01e6b5","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1939706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Covert","original_name":"Martin Covert","popularity":0.0924,"profile_path":"/1aG46YTpob1UVlFA1izF4jm6HKs.jpg","cast_id":22,"character":"Mr. Willinger","credit_id":"5c0951e9925141479501cbba","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1751007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kasey Cummings","original_name":"Kasey Cummings","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/aWFRBBDdGu7jdsw2MHswDWsHgqR.jpg","cast_id":23,"character":"Brian","credit_id":"5c0951f692514147aa01b789","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2189940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cheryl Lynn Shelton","original_name":"Cheryl Lynn Shelton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":24,"character":"Mrs. Gunderman","credit_id":"5c095212925141479801c653","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1289264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michelle Sherrill","original_name":"Michelle Sherrill","popularity":0.0971,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":25,"character":"Mrs. Willinger","credit_id":"5c095221c3a368252001ecc2","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2189942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mia Thibodeaux","original_name":"Mia Thibodeaux","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":26,"character":"Molly","credit_id":"5c095230925141479801c68c","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1755088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leslie Anne Whitman","original_name":"Leslie Anne Whitman","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":27,"character":"Woman at Table","credit_id":"5c0952480e0a2638b801db53","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1485332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel G.
