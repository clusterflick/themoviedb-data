The bad news falls rather well though given that Suzanne has developed a fondness for Albert Delpierre, a young Frenchman who has come to Brussels to study the brewing methods of her father. She decides to break up amicably but Séraphin does not dare admit it to his father, who becomes angry with the Beulemanses. Suzanne's uncle, a vicar, tries to settle the whole thing but the coronation of King Albert I gives rise to renewed resentment. Suzanne finally finds the way to solve the problem: she takes Meulenmeester apart, reminds him of his own misconduct when he was a young man, asks him to forgive Séraphin while her own father accepts Albert as his son-in-law.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":"/76fc6nHY7Pjdna7GTGho2oCu2mk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50003,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tellus Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1950-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Marriage of Mademoiselle Beulemans","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Alers","original_name":"Christian Alers","popularity":0.0524,"profile_path":"/cyMVWXxdWnHKK3FCkBUETwCWlC0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Albert Delpierre","credit_id":"620f4a9fe0ca7f00436d72fe","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3431794,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suzy Andremont","original_name":"Suzy Andremont","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Isabelle","credit_id":"620f4aabd9f4a6004382f41b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3431797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elise Bernard","original_name":"Elise Bernard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Madame Beulemans","credit_id":"620f4bc94c25920043478ded","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1121618,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hubert Daix","original_name":"Hubert Daix","popularity":0.0814,"profile_path":"/kV2q78j6fNLGTTryTLQHxPFlKKv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Monsieur Beulemans","credit_id":"620f4bcfa84ff7004752e4fc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saturnin Fabre","original_name":"Saturnin Fabre","popularity":0.1254,"profile_path":"/cxpVmAdqLqGkrlGBpJlOdpIvxra.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mr. Delpierre","credit_id":"620f4bdf1f0275006a6573a9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3431798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean François","original_name":"Jean François","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mostinckx","credit_id":"620f4bfaa242320044be28c9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2629101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Gillain","original_name":"Maurice Gillain","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Séraphin Meulemeester","credit_id":"620f4c05a84ff7006d1dd2ab","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Larquey","original_name":"Pierre Larquey","popularity":0.2587,"profile_path":"/hXNfCJTnejlhSXqwTA3K4qkKdcn.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Vicar","credit_id":"620f4c0caa78980042f5cb22","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3431800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raoul Leclerc","original_name":"Raoul Leclerc","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Meulemeester father","credit_id":"620f4c18aa78980069188df6","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3431801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Pierre Ray","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Ray","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Isidore","credit_id":"620f4c277ad08c0042d1ef23","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francine Vendel","original_name":"Francine Vendel","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Suzanne Beulemans","credit_id":"620f4c339824c80042b38870","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1082578,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"André Cerf","original_name":"André Cerf","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be26225c3a36810c600b543","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0140362","wikidata_id":"Q3224310","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.74,"height":968,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/76fc6nHY7Pjdna7GTGho2oCu2mk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":716}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Brussels","release_date":"1950-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1950-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
