She embodies the modest and charming Amina, this sleepwalker who, escaping from her bedroom, becomes another person as she wanders through the night.  This opera by Bellini is a score seemingly written in a daydream, where melody is apparently suspended in time and the heroine's very soul rises to the surface, and where instruments take on transparent tones.  At the same time, Bellini portrays the cruelest of worlds – our own – where it is more than difficult for fragility and gentleness to shine past the darker rashness and unfriendliness of the characters.","popularity":0.1024,"poster_path":"/rl3qExmZa48YKRZhvWCrl0C6KyS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Sonnambula","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":550023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalie Dessay","original_name":"Natalie Dessay","popularity":0.2413,"profile_path":"/wppFso5aGmto3Pj5cOU42Z1x2PF.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5be03438c3a3682b320408e7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1548495,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Javier Camarena","original_name":"Javier Camarena","popularity":0.1016,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5be034450e0a26058d03d194","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1316134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michele Pertusi","original_name":"Michele Pertusi","popularity":0.1226,"profile_path":"/fJx3QXGTMQ6Z0sCAQIvFIsyNLlE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5be0344d92514137c90377aa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2168691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cornelia Oncioiu","original_name":"Cornelia Oncioiu","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5be034550e0a26057903c25b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2168692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-Adeline Henry","original_name":"Marie-Adeline Henry","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Lisa","credit_id":"5be0345e92514137c90377ce","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2923085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paris Opera Orchestra","original_name":"Paris Opera Orchestra","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff95704383df2003d33c818","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rl3qExmZa48YKRZhvWCrl0C6KyS.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
