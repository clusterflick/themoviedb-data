Sephora Woldu plays \"Sephora\" who, like the director, is an architecture student but also a filmmaker. She is pitching to her traditional mother a film she wants to make about a man who fled their home country and ended up in San Francisco. As a recently arrived immigrant, he is terribly homesick for his native Eritrea, but will not admit it due to unease towards speaking ill of the country; and more consciously in hesitance of admitting hard truths about his culture and himself. \"Itâ€™s colorful and visually whimsical in a way that can only be described as if the Wizard of Oz went to Africa,\" said Woldu.","popularity":0.1833,"poster_path":"/tfmNpQWl1IAaNnjrEmhktPzs8cu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An experimental musical movie about Eritrea","title":"Life is Fare","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2169045,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sephora Woldu","original_name":"Sephora Woldu","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be08368925141682e0004a7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2169045,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sephora Woldu","original_name":"Sephora Woldu","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be08373c3a36854c800049d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2169045,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sephora Woldu","original_name":"Sephora Woldu","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be0835b925141682e000499","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7390122","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2222,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tfmNpQWl1IAaNnjrEmhktPzs8cu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":409,"name":"africa"},{"id":220343,"name":"diaspora"},{"id":225359,"name":"eritrea"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
