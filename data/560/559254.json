She believes that Ricardo is her father. In reality, he took her in at the age of eighteen months in a douar abandoned during the conquest. One day a Berber chief, Tamar, sees Conchita, tells her that she is from his tribe and wants to take her away. She rejects it, then accepts later to find that Muslim civilization is incompatible with the Christian training she received. She escapes and succeeds in obtaining forgiveness from Tamar. A French officer from the Intelligence Service offers to collect it.","popularity":0.7763,"poster_path":"/x0RRm3UfZqpVPt7k6G30cVvsNDe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119350,"logo_path":"/9cN16pXrShjqVtHN7h7OZN6pDps.png","name":"Les Films
