To calm him down she makes him believe that Jean dies of love for another woman and wants to commit suicide if his love is not returned. The two accomplices select a young creature named Claire Coussol for the (unwitting role)of the \"beloved\". As for Jean, he plays the suicidal man to perfection. But what the two lovers had not planned at all is that Claire, deeply moved by Jean's \"act of desperation\", starts growing fond of him.","popularity":0.2666,"poster_path":"/j1Q7Oi1HCfF85uMnll8KdI2odz1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1946-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Femme fatale","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Arnoux","original_name":"Robert Arnoux","popularity":0.2375,"profile_path":"/9OED4sVb9bKNECEKDeOjKUVvhLQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Monsieur Coussol","credit_id":"62087b511bf266001ce2f5cd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Brasseur","original_name":"Pierre Brasseur","popularity":0.3248,"profile_path":"/n15deEWYZZrzbaozdGSL9kxl8lI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jean Pleyard","credit_id":"62087b5acae17c00429cb463","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1342969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marguerite de Morlaye","original_name":"Marguerite de Morlaye","popularity":0.0518,"profile_path":"/wXkjqJag1YVzuzZIOnVGBQrHGIw.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The old player","credit_id":"62087b6435a61e00bb4c3987","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Dumat","original_name":"Philippe Dumat","popularity":0.1918,"profile_path":"/ypj6hYkv5bbL4rENybsQDS0wBZR.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The bartender","credit_id":"62087b6dc92c5d0068e44818","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arsenio Freignac","original_name":"Arsenio Freignac","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Antonio","credit_id":"62087b7726dac100663a3105","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":927557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacqueline Gauthier","original_name":"Jacqueline Gauthier","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":"/rZj1TIG0APV77H1ezPZMYNfeswF.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Fanny Le Doublond","credit_id":"62087b821cac8c006776c7c2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Hébey","original_name":"Jean Hébey","popularity":0.0847,"profile_path":"/crDa35hti1k9yxMbpw7eWx71l2A.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"The hotel manager","credit_id":"62087b90ae6f09009bbf7252","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcel Loche","original_name":"Marcel Loche","popularity":0.0694,"profile_path":"/c68BvrWZViNYiFS83u0EE60FtxI.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"62087b9626dac100663a3120","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Louvigny","original_name":"Jacques Louvigny","popularity":0.0498,"profile_path":"/5d3BY6ohlzDLwpNkueTvepDLJei.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mr. Le Doublond","credit_id":"62087b9fd7fbda009321c711","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":239342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madeleine Sologne","original_name":"Madeleine Sologne","popularity":0.0525,"profile_path":"/6WwusOIzu6IRauuWcSHkv5ewtJr.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"62087ba91d78f200db46c02e","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":28329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaby Sylvia","original_name":"Gaby Sylvia","popularity":0.1049,"profile_path":"/rrTae7cNccuuKzrDshAIL1N9B0S.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Claire Coussol","credit_id":"62087bb4945d3600659cc275","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29721,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Boyer","original_name":"Jean Boyer","popularity":0.1036,"profile_path":"/xCE7iLFjZxCLIlOzh6ATIbCJlHX.jpg","credit_id":"5bdf332192514137d40274ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0199519","wikidata_id":"Q16651987","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j1Q7Oi1HCfF85uMnll8KdI2odz1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1946-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
