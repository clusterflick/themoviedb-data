Verdi expert Gianandrea Noseda conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in a production that marked the return of the Canadian stage director Robert Carsen to the festival following a 17 year hiatus. Carsen sets his interpretation of this classic opera in the cutthroat world of the circus.  Based on Victor Hugo's play Le roi s’amuse, Verdi's opera in three acts Rigoletto premiered in 1851. Similar to the play that inspired it, the opera faced censorship because of its controversial subject of libertinism at court. The opera’s tragic story revolves around the licentious Duke of Mantua, his hunchbacked court jester Rigoletto, and the jester’s beautiful daughter, Gilda.","popularity":0.1578,"poster_path":"/rRx1xUUUaryNpYSwf94uKZjmC6b.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rigoletto - Festival d'Aix-en-Provence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1566660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Gagnidze","original_name":"George Gagnidze","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/uID691lBQtJ0delH6ZndTsSJ5QA.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5be295bb0e0a2614ae00dde6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1611734,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irina Lungu","original_name":"Irina Lungu","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5be295c59251415c8200ce90","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1629182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arturo Chacón-Cruz","original_name":"Arturo Chacón-Cruz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5be295cc9251415c7a00d04f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1897654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gábor Bretz","original_name":"Gábor Bretz","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/ykmAYWQChJIBEXTHXYYphrjlV3N.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5be295d3c3a36810c400e6fb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1684801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josè Maria Lo Monaco","original_name":"Josè Maria Lo Monaco","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5be295dd9251415c8200cea3","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":2141,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/rRx1xUUUaryNpYSwf94uKZjmC6b.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":885,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ytxA2dVW5Dm3ufSkkAqgAyTMRTD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":590}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
