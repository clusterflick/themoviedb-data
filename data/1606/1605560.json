In both parts, the connecting thread is the knock on the door. It is a story about a man who finds himself in various situations during his life, even being shot, and after each of those situations, he hears a knock on the door and when he opens it, there is a man in front of it who hits him on the head. That is the animated part, which has 32 frames. The live-action part is made up of 18 frames, divided into two sequences. In the first sequence, the animator makes the cartoon he has already seen, hears a knock on the door and when he opens it, he is also hit on the head by a man. In the second sequence, a woman makes a collection of photographs showing the animator in various situations, and suddenly hears a knock on the door. The dilemma arises whether to open the door?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/8y0cpT9GOi2tIECquWZBROp1hGv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28208,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vardar Film","origin_country":"MK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Macedonian","iso_639_1":"mk","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"That Is My Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1494255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kiril Psaltirov","original_name":"Kiril Psaltirov","popularity":0.0967,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"69518d6a74b02cdd3988de15","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2828991,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boro Pejčinov","original_name":"Boro Pejčinov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69518cbe1579cecae388dd70","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2828991,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boro Pejčinov","original_name":"Boro Pejčinov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69518ce8806ae764cf74e2d9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2828991,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boro Pejčinov","original_name":"Boro Pejčinov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69518cfc76a338c001d79637","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1364576,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dimitar Grbevski","original_name":"Dimitar Grbevski","popularity":0.3884,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69518d1566cca98c6a88dd3e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1543318,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gligor Pakovski","original_name":"Gligor Pakovski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69518d3a2f6fd97c8ac37881","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1543318,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gligor Pakovski","original_name":"Gligor Pakovski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69518d4925713176bbd796f4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8y0cpT9GOi2tIECquWZBROp1hGv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
