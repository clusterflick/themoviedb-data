At the Breaux Bridge Crawfish Festival we see everthing Cajuns value take to the stage: their language, music, food, and crawfish. As the film traces the thousands of pounds of crawfish served up at the festival to their natural habitat, the Atchafalaya Basin, fishermen from Catahoula tel stories of their fight to retain their way of life. It is an old story in Louisiana: the pople and land suffer from the exploitation of the oil companies. What is at stake is the loss of the most productive swamp in the world and the people's connection to that land.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"King Crawfish","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3506728,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Conni Castille","original_name":"Conni Castille","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6950b1651c3300effcc3745d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3506728,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Conni Castille","original_name":"Conni Castille","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6950b1701c3300effcc37460","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3506728,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Conni Castille","original_name":"Conni Castille","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6950b1895c07f65bbfcbce4d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1263329,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Allison Bohl","original_name":"Allison Bohl","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6950b1955c07f65bbfcbce51","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1263329,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Allison Bohl","original_name":"Allison Bohl","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6950b1a35c07f65bbfcbce59","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4147709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristi Guillory","original_name":"Kristi Guillory","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6950b1b8500dc3f9e07c6d2f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1263329,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Allison Bohl","original_name":"Allison Bohl","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6950b1d91ec993c09a4ace0a","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5902424,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Peter Dehart","original_name":"Peter Dehart","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6950b1e425901e7d0e70f281","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1695790","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
