The town council sends Lester to Dr. Mills of Boston to be treated for his condition. Now cured, his propensity for telling the truth on all occasions upsets village life: he works in a grocery store and informs customers of stale products; he also ruins a real-estate deal that would have meant prosperity for the town. Dr. Mills states that the only way to return Lester to his former safe tricks will be to arrange that he fall in love.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/20C3vNhjQlFJsqJDxCrbFz4HbMt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":166858,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sawyer-Lubin Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1921-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Garments of Truth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":156143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gareth Hughes","original_name":"Gareth Hughes","popularity":0.4593,"profile_path":"/pNlzPwHTsR0qJiBPkQ2ClQu9QZY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lester Crope","credit_id":"695195c21ec993c09a4ad220","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1070243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethel Grandin","original_name":"Ethel Grandin","popularity":0.1194,"profile_path":"/mwm51QkLuMj3UmIVE2XQL7Cuspe.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Catherine Willis","credit_id":"695195cc1c52822d3bcbd51b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1591718,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Steppling","original_name":"John Steppling","popularity":0.1833,"profile_path":"/3bmmaV4I0GfFNLkflGq8z00YMZR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Deacon Ballantine","credit_id":"695195d8bf210200927c7162","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":144012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frances Raymond","original_name":"Frances Raymond","popularity":0.1405,"profile_path":"/47pyPlR7hAVI4FDeyO6YK9aUlMc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mrs. Ballantine","credit_id":"695195e2bf210200927c7166","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret McWade","original_name":"Margaret McWade","popularity":0.7571,"profile_path":"/y0pqaVwZdPtGV0gDyVQwlO5Ldf2.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mrs. Crope","credit_id":"695195ed198c6023124ad292","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1795627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graham Pettie","original_name":"Graham Pettie","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mr. Crope","credit_id":"695195f81ae704f54d7c7159","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1254695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Norcross","original_name":"Frank Norcross","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"James H.
