Once there, Kendall realizes that Azalea is very poor and is also the abused wife of Major Caswell, a drunkard who takes from Azalea every cent she earns. Kendall is able to piece their story together by following the movements of a torn dollar bill, which he gives to Azalea's former slave Caesar and which eventually winds up in Caswell's hands. In order to help Azalea, Kendall convinces his editor to increase her stipend to eight cents a word and also to advance her $30.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/t9sMQ9n5yMTuMeJuoNHU1YTGhYS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Will Repay","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1054643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corinne Griffith","original_name":"Corinne Griffith","popularity":0.127,"profile_path":"/aBcI7FfEVDDlxPMnxOoX8bmozL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Virginia Rodney","credit_id":"69506c651a8f746b7788d841","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William R.
