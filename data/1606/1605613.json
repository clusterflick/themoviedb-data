Burke Marston seeks forgetfulness through drink, and Hugh MacLaren is searching for gold, but Evan Mears' reason remains a mystery. A weird cry outside leads them to a girl half-buried in the snow who has lost her reason and her memory. The efforts of the three men to help her regain her faculties seem fruitless until Burke tells her the story of the lawyer who years earlier had cheated his mother out of her fortune.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/1A2Aj3z6jUEYSBFdVSvjmHV3jcn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37904,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jesse D.
