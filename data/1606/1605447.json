Hamilton Vance travels to the mountains of Kentucky to get local color for his stories, and falls in love with Roxie Bradley, the daughter of a moonshiner. Regarded at first with suspicion by the mountaineers, Vance finally wins their confidence and is appointed teacher in the little log school house. The former teacher, resentful at the intrusion, attempts to shoot Vance through the schoolhouse window, but Roxie intercepts the bullet. Vance nurses her back to health, engendering the jealousy of Lily Bud Raines, who starts a rumor that Vance is a federal agent spying on the moonshiners.","popularity":0.1,"poster_path":"/hed5PfWuQMe4353sWpwigWrjAso.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1307,"logo_path":"/z6FFp0gxKiB2KLS9n3fC8uX6ZcR.png","name":"Triangle Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mountain Dew","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margery Wilson","original_name":"Margery Wilson","popularity":0.2816,"profile_path":"/lEcSh2qIB3tldz7wNPKU8qd87MS.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Roxie Bradley","credit_id":"69515abc67274c801d4ad144","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1569639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Gunn","original_name":"Charles Gunn","popularity":0.2349,"profile_path":"/4eQXdUj3Qz7weEbevE5NbmQgxIe.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"J.
