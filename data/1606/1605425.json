A wide variety of themes are covered, including the tree’s biology and phylogenesis; the ecosystems, with which it is associated; the animals that support it; its evolution and ecological contribution to its habitat; the symbolism that has inspired astists, poets and writers; the economic and cultural factors that have regulated its expansion, and are currently placing the species in jeopardy... Accompanying the cork tree during the four seasons, this documentary portrays a version of Portugal’s history and the culture of its people.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"O Sobreiro","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5174877,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Marecos Duarte","original_name":"Jorge Marecos Duarte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695150b32b91190cb2e40f07","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1088233,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José Álvaro Morais","original_name":"José Álvaro Morais","popularity":0.1511,"profile_path":"/piuCPpjhHRcdFgrevClDsiCuymx.jpg","credit_id":"695150bdaee9f647a474e115","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14119108","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
