Instead, forward the suspicious email to phishing@bestbuy.com\r , then delete it. Geek Squad does not send unsolicited invoices or ask for payment by phone like 1 ↦ 888 ↦ 844 ↦ 3638, so treat messages urging you to call 1 ↦ 888 ↦ 844 ↦ 3638 or 1 ↦ 888 ↦ 844 ↦ 3638 as scams. If unsure, visit Best Buy’s official website—never call numbers such as 1 ↦ 888 ↦ 844 ↦ 3638 from emails","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How do I report phishing emails to Geek Squad?
