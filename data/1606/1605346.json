Linking disparate twentieth-century Taiwanese histories, it employs an architectural framework to invoke Lee Guang-Hui, an Indigenous Taiwanese soldier who fought for the Imperial Japanese Army in World War II and lived in isolation on Indonesia’s Morotai island until 1974, believing the war had never ended. His return after three decades to a transformed Taiwan—whose language he no longer spoke—casts him as a figure seemingly outside history. His multiple names—Teruo Nakamura in Japanese and Attun Palalin in Ami—mark the shifting spaces, identities, and temporalities that structure Chronotopia.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/a3SOx1xO0Sq05ggp5X6GLg2C25t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chronotopia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5900847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"李光輝","original_name":"李光輝","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"self","credit_id":"69512f3631339b66b570f542","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5903045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"李哲雄","original_name":"李哲雄","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"695130395e13fdf58dcbcfe9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5903046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"李美花","original_name":"李美花","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6951304376a338c001d79488","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5903047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"李弘","original_name":"李弘","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6951304ecc4c9e73274ad14b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5903037,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernd Behr","original_name":"Bernd Behr","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69512f13478d01ceb570f44c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a3SOx1xO0Sq05ggp5X6GLg2C25t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
