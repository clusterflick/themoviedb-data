Though only 28 and 27 years old respectively, they've been living as hobos since they dropped out of college. They're stuck in a cycle of bouncing from city to city on trains, sleeping in the woods, digging through trash cans, and playing music for alcohol money. The documentary portrays their struggles to find a life for themselves on the road, while chasing their musical dreams and the eventual goal of slowing down and finding a home.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Tracks Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5904572,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josh Harrell","original_name":"Josh Harrell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695258fce4d7d287f5c37c8a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1763265","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
