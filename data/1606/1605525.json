Remarkable voices emerge to paint the picture of the great master boulderer, John Gill. Individuals who have been part of it all, such as Ron Kauk, Rich Goldstone, Tom Higgins, Royal Robbins, John Sherman, and filmmaker Pat Ament himself. New footage uncovered of Gill enriches these images, and his voice too comes alive with detailed analysis of some of his iconic climbs. As deep and touching as the first film, 'The disciples of Gill', this second incarnation continues but stands alone as well, as a work of art itself.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/iyf2Bj3e0K4SXgtyClsxe05kC5b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":284579,"logo_path":null,"name":"Two Lights Publishing","origin_country":""},{"id":284580,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ephemeral Train","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Gill Across Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1850028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Gill","original_name":"John Gill","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/jlmy0Ax0ZUr0QXjHdFzcA9CngK8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"69517886def737c09ae410e1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5903370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pat Ament","original_name":"Pat Ament","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"695178a0c9e9634b7474e23d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5903597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Higgins","original_name":"Tom Higgins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"695178b47830eb1426c3782a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5903598,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Layton Kor","original_name":"Layton Kor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"695178be9f1660edade41076","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1850029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Sherman","original_name":"John Sherman","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"695178c8466c3966b970f4e9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5903600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rich Goldstone","original_name":"Rich Goldstone","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"695178d4d721a2cf0fc37868","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ron Kauk","original_name":"Ron Kauk","popularity":0.229,"profile_path":"/3RZxnIelz495m0vjWBAbb9ixOYN.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"695178dd22d62acac1e410a8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Bachar","original_name":"John Bachar","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/1Kkxr1k5PF9wnRfSfySwp3I6KwX.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"695178e6b0d00ceac17c6f97","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Long","original_name":"John Long","popularity":0.1243,"profile_path":"/q225RGvJ2q44NxDL4EeQ1ngXDp9.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"695178f0def737c09ae410e7","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1408880,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Royal Robbins","original_name":"Royal Robbins","popularity":0.3374,"profile_path":"/kYicVA9fFNtwlb8AiXp6pdEKgtE.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"695178fa806ae764cf74e22c","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5903604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Horst","original_name":"Eric Horst","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"69517908692b5125254ad26d","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5903370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pat Ament","original_name":"Pat Ament","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6951787701fdd85625e41278","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iyf2Bj3e0K4SXgtyClsxe05kC5b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
