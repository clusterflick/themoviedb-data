After earning degrees from Harvard and Yale, Adams left a successful career designing skyscrapers to focus on spacecraft and habitats for the Moon and Mars. Filmed just four days before her passing at age 53, the documentary captures her reflections on a career defined by innovation, empathy, and curiosity, and her final mission to apply space architecture principles toward addressing Earth’s climate challenges.  This remarkable film is a must-see for all space architects and anyone inspired by the intersection of design, technology, and humanity. It celebrates not only Constance Adams’ pioneering contributions to the field but also her enduring belief that the lessons learned in space can transform life on Earth.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"US 2025 Rebecca Carpenter","title":"Space Architect","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5904124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Constance Adams","original_name":"Constance Adams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6951cabd53166d948ee412a3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2465759,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rebecca Carpenter","original_name":"Rebecca Carpenter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6951cb38c185755462d79769","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"The film premiered at the Architecture and Design Film Festival (ADFF) in New York City on October 17, 2025 followed by a panel with director Rebecca Carpenter, Prof. Deborah Berke (Dean of the Yale School of Architecture), and New York Times writer Julia Lasky.
