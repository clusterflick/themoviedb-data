It drops from the sky in delicate snowflakes, and pounds the ground in hailstones. It fills our ice trays and provides power for electricity. Water is the vital compound we need for life. Take a fresh look at this natural resource and you'll find out why ice floats when most frozen substances sink. And how water rises in the trunks of trees, working against the pull of gravity. And how God's supply of Living Water is the difference between spiritual life and death.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/dUdqTdjjFz53uR8IuGrgkF8ZGK3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Moody Science Series","title":"Where the Waters Run","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dUdqTdjjFz53uR8IuGrgkF8ZGK3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
