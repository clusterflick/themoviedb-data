Through striking imagery, it highlights how hands serve as tools of survival, communication, labor, creation, and even danger. The film juxtaposes tender gestures with more unsettling or surreal images, creating moments of intensity that feel almost shocking.  As the narrative unfolds, the sequences become less structured—shifting from bold, provocative scenes to looser, more meandering imagery. While the first half is arresting in its visual power and metaphorical depth, the momentum fades toward the end, leaving the conclusion less impactful than the earlier sequences.—A/V Geeks","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":90143,"logo_path":null,"name":"Contemporary Films","origin_country":""},{"id":8100,"logo_path":"/1HuVRo0SYPSzYvduxVf4baaWqOI.png","name":"Mafilm","origin_country":"HU"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hands","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5902133,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ágnes Varga","original_name":"Ágnes Varga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69506a9f272bd61a8670f13e","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5902134,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Gábor Vitéz","original_name":"Gábor Vitéz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69506b0f53166d948ee40ccb","department":"Crew","job":"Dramaturgy"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70917,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Zdenkó Tamássy","original_name":"Zdenkó Tamássy","popularity":0.0829,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69506be8d721a2cf0fc3731f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5231260,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tamás Kassai","original_name":"Tamás Kassai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69506c3e25901e7d0e70f132","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5902139,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Magda Boros","original_name":"Magda Boros","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69506c7a9f1660edade40c8d","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1839810,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"István György","original_name":"István György","popularity":0.1128,"profile_path":"/b6H2cQReQVbr6ug0KbhrmQiQlm2.jpg","credit_id":"69506cf71ae704f54d7c6bf8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1839810,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"István György","original_name":"István György","popularity":0.1128,"profile_path":"/b6H2cQReQVbr6ug0KbhrmQiQlm2.jpg","credit_id":"69506d0e5e13fdf58dcbcccf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1839810,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"István György","original_name":"István György","popularity":0.1128,"profile_path":"/b6H2cQReQVbr6ug0KbhrmQiQlm2.jpg","credit_id":"69506d277830eb1426c3734a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4061739,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ferenc Neményi","original_name":"Ferenc Neményi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69506d92a5dc163eac7c6c5b","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1271798,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"János Tóth","original_name":"János Tóth","popularity":0.22,"profile_path":"/kWaCjQMGZQh0D95zMq0s5Q4zOEE.jpg","credit_id":"69506da0678196e6c77c6bab","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hu","note":"","release_date":"1969-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
