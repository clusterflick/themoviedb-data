The Bishop desires Dan to become a minister, but he prefers to be a fisherman. The Deemster of Man has a son and a daughter, Mona and Ewan. Dan and Mona are in love. She consents to marry him when he can obtain her father's consent. Ewan, her brother, decides to become a clergyman, even in the face of his father's insistence that he take up business as a vocation. The Deemster opposes Dan's suit for Mona's hand because he has fallen from his high estate as the son of the Bishop by becoming a fisherman.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":41448,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arrow Film Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Deemster","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Bishop's Son","type":"Alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2074387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Derwent Hall Caine","original_name":"Derwent Hall Caine","popularity":0.1689,"profile_path":"/4Z7V0pkpDVpdSydGfqOcGoVaZB7.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Daniel Mylrea","credit_id":"6951c5500f0f03840970f520","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1120815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marian Swayne","original_name":"Marian Swayne","popularity":0.0733,"profile_path":"/mL3K4B1gNFTpBCldmFdKJXxvwK7.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mona","credit_id":"6951c56408f7423875e41267","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80546,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sidney Bracey","original_name":"Sidney Bracey","popularity":0.2036,"profile_path":"/g8ZJZVGVqa5Hn8sEsLjkIKjTVv9.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Bishop, Father of Dan","credit_id":"6951c56d08f7423875e4126b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1904781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Froom","original_name":"Albert Froom","popularity":0.0833,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Deemster, Father of Mona","credit_id":"6951c57622d62acac1e412f8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5904103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"K.
