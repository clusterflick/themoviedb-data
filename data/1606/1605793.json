Adithyaa, a socially awkward romantic, finally asks out his crush. But a divine error traps him in a time loop where the same date keeps repeating — again and again.  Watched over by two exhausted celestial officials, Adithyaa tries everything: changing himself, saying the “right” things, becoming the version she might love.  But the more perfect he becomes, the more he loses himself.  TRY, AGAIN is a romantic sci-fi short film about dating, destiny, and the dangerous idea that love has to be earned by becoming someone else.  Because sometimes… the only way to find love  is to stop trying.  A short film about modern relationships, self-worth, and emotional compatibility.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/5FkZBPx2EDsfrUt850zXA20mVT8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":244082,"logo_path":"/dLm7vdgKgwvEbrY2MCdhMgcHye4.png","name":"Jam
