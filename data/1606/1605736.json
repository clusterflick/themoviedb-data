His French fiancee, Martha Landeau, and her father flee to the family farm, which is near the Marne River, for safety. When German troops take over the area, they raid Marthe's farm and attempt to ravage her--but suddenly, out of the sky, comes a French fighter plane that scatters the Germans--and its pilot is none other than Gerald. However, that's not the end of their troubles, by any means.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/21pwJR98Rhz92qLEEhJ36sG0pcq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"For France","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Earle","original_name":"Edward Earle","popularity":0.4489,"profile_path":"/mybd58aGD8RYdfjObAcbdgx4og2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Edward Ackland","credit_id":"6951bddbab1bc5d69acbd2fe","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1721664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Howe","original_name":"Betty Howe","popularity":0.1065,"profile_path":"/mSplExdJxSsA9NOu3Z3lQLglcGz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Marthe Landeau","credit_id":"6951bde6cc4c9e73274ad4ec","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1388104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Donaldson","original_name":"Arthur Donaldson","popularity":5.8325,"profile_path":"/iNsq7CbzoyPfExTeXZoK1wJBTPa.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Rudolph Von Glahm","credit_id":"6951bdef650a414493e41238","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1387034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Maurice","original_name":"Mary Maurice","popularity":0.2082,"profile_path":"/rljSgfrSJetffMW7ZNhjQVmcjcg.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mere Loubette","credit_id":"6951bdf9b112fd556de41339","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5904063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Anderson","original_name":"Frank Anderson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Monsieur Landeau","credit_id":"6951be3366cca98c6a88de37","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erich von Stroheim","original_name":"Erich von Stroheim","popularity":0.4541,"profile_path":"/lUoSEdmX6Cl7lLUnV4ewLkVDnhY.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Minor Role (uncredited)","credit_id":"6951be3eb773c3216cd7977d","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21311,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wesley Ruggles","original_name":"Wesley Ruggles","popularity":1.3646,"profile_path":"/x0OBvXc9HY5aEHU9YDOF78qIGhV.jpg","credit_id":"6951beb93c734bde77c37990","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1147115,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Harry Warren","original_name":"Harry Warren","popularity":0.3593,"profile_path":"/hzqhJ0YEwHczJNLHwqvUJhf7Efv.jpg","credit_id":"6951bf04026c4cbe4388dd17","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1312749,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andre Roosevelt","original_name":"Andre Roosevelt","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6951bf1fb773c3216cd7979d","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1353751,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jules Cronjager","original_name":"Jules Cronjager","popularity":0.0861,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6951bf31ab1bc5d69acbd30f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1374701,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cyrus Townsend Brady","original_name":"Cyrus Townsend Brady","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6951bf43bf210200927c7234","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3285480,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William B.
