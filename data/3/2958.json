Teil: Die Liebeskomödie des Homunculus","overview":"The homunculus and his companion Edgar Rodin make an invention that would allow the hateful homunculus to destroy the world. But first he wants to find out about love. When he observes how young Anna is rejected by her parents, he takes care of her and asks her parents for forgiveness - without success. He brings her to her seducer, who also rejects the girl. The homunculus then takes revenge by ruining the man financially and throwing Anna at his feet. But she still loves the villain and asks Homunculus for mercy. The homunculus cannot understand this feeling of love - he wants to try it out on himself. He puts a young woman who loves him to the hardest test, but she will do anything for him, sacrificing her fiancé and her parents. Only when he reveals his artificial nature to her, she leaves him. This experience confirms the homunculus in his intention to destroy mankind.","popularity":0.4556,"poster_path":"/ao1Hj7MWK4EBKacMA5yijjfCXNL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1916-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Love Tragedy of the Homunculus","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":28988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aud Egede-Nissen","original_name":"Aud Egede-Nissen","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":"/271xabIyKpp8R0mjRRD6eZkfqjn.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"o.
