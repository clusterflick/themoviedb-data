Helene, who crosses the junction on her motor scooter every day, has taken a shine to Fritz a long while ago. Although Fritz yields right-of-way to her remarkably often, the two have not spoken to each other. In order to finally get to know him better, Helene deliberately performs a traffic violation. Her plan is working: She is ordered to take road safety education lessons from Fritz and they get closer. New problems arise in the shape of Mrs. Messmer who must pay a monetary fine. She feels discriminated against by Fritz and complains about him to his supervisor.","popularity":0.4083,"poster_path":"/7slPTUASqMkVonBrHbmTAc1AYko.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":602,"logo_path":"/pVsXRFbYVDe5BhsATCAh1rt5F0k.png","name":"DEFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"}],"release_date":"1964-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Small White Mouse","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Small white Mouse","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rolf Herricht","original_name":"Rolf Herricht","popularity":0.0917,"profile_path":"/m8jLuWZmuh3dQi0zGXDeIln6mhZ.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Fritz Bachmann","credit_id":"52fe433ec3a36847f80455af","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karin Schröder","original_name":"Karin Schröder","popularity":0.1062,"profile_path":"/cVU8Z5f1k2hRgRf8faFG9vyEO6R.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Helene Bräuer","credit_id":"52fe433ec3a36847f80455b7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marianne Wünscher","original_name":"Marianne Wünscher","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/feYd4Rv0VfjTn7PMPTxdWFrd3Rz.jpg","cast_id":21,"character":"Frau Messmer","credit_id":"52fe433ec3a36847f80455c3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerd Ehlers","original_name":"Gerd Ehlers","popularity":0.0802,"profile_path":"/zF6vHYwdMHIMnIjzOqIe90aVvIq.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Herr Simmel","credit_id":"52fe433ec3a36847f80455ab","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carola Braunbock","original_name":"Carola Braunbock","popularity":0.1656,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Nachbarin","credit_id":"52fe433ec3a36847f804559f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathilde Danegger","original_name":"Mathilde Danegger","popularity":0.1085,"profile_path":"/GAAMpc2gCfZatFnlz7l1rHx5e3.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Mutter Hirsch","credit_id":"52fe433ec3a36847f80455a3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Dommisch","original_name":"Peter Dommisch","popularity":0.3046,"profile_path":"/njDu5LmdnGb2x3lmhFtg74jKvwc.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Lörke","credit_id":"52fe433ec3a36847f80455a7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johannes Maus","original_name":"Johannes Maus","popularity":0.1379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Ekel","credit_id":"52fe433ec3a36847f80455b3","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22351,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabine Thalbach","original_name":"Sabine Thalbach","popularity":0.1179,"profile_path":"/y40argwAlBVSoKhP9a0UsHszjQk.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Dame im VPKA","credit_id":"52fe433ec3a36847f80455bb","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jochen Thomas","original_name":"Jochen Thomas","popularity":0.1275,"profile_path":"/11kflWEBh08qZpB0TAkLgoSPIWD.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Hauptmann Gabler","credit_id":"52fe433ec3a36847f80455bf","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14218,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Werner Lierck","original_name":"Werner Lierck","popularity":0.079,"profile_path":"/gNu38Me7SmY0SS1qPSNwdg8TWN.jpg","cast_id":23,"character":"Werbeleiter","credit_id":"52fe433ec3a36847f80455cd","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1832706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siegfried Göhler","original_name":"Siegfried Göhler","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":24,"character":"Kriminalkommisar","credit_id":"593f90ed9251414b0200a612","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1518398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolf Donath","original_name":"Rudolf Donath","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":25,"character":"","credit_id":"593f9127c3a36803b400ad55","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1832710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Kainz","original_name":"Walter Kainz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":26,"character":"","credit_id":"593f914cc3a368041a009edc","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1724659,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolf Fleck","original_name":"Rudolf Fleck","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":27,"character":"","credit_id":"593f91669251414af200adc4","order":14},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter E.
