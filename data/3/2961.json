Teil: Die Vernichtung der Menschheit","overview":"For a long time the homunculus had to hide from his pursuers. But now he mingles with humanity again and sows discord, strife and murder. One day, when he meets an orphaned girl, he takes her to the shepherd Rudolf's parents. His goal is to pair the two together in order to breed a new human race from them. To this end, he kidnaps her to a deserted island. But the plan fails because Rudolf tries to kill the homunculus after learning his true identity. In revenge, the homunculus destroys the entire island, including the young couple. His hitherto loyal companion Edgar Rodin is so horrified by this deed that he renounces the homunculus and threatens him with death.","popularity":0.5794,"poster_path":"/ddb3pyBsmfzFJd8bInXKGjAFtou.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1917-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Destruction of Mankind","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":28988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aud Egede-Nissen","original_name":"Aud Egede-Nissen","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":"/271xabIyKpp8R0mjRRD6eZkfqjn.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"o.
