Foenss, a Danish star, is the perfect creature manufactured in a laboratory by Kuehne. Having discovered his origins, that he has no 'soul' and is incapable of love, he revenges himself on mankind, instigating revolutions and becoming a monstrous but beautiful tyrant, relentlessly pursued by his creator-father who seeks to rectify his mistake.","popularity":0.2711,"poster_path":"/hYdwfZrgV3QeUr0eAeiS9B06wJE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51972,"logo_path":null,"name":"Deutsche Bioscope","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1916-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Perfect Man… Without Soul!","title":"The Artificial Man","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Die Geburt des Homunculus","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Homunculus - Manden uden Sjæl","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Homunculus","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":28984,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fern Andra","original_name":"Fern Andra","popularity":0.0723,"profile_path":"/t5Hplu5JNedrrPOwAf66iKWHmjL.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"o.
