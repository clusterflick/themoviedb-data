As they brutally kill a family in a remote area, including the parents and their little daughter, the family's teenage son, Aigin, observes the slaughter. He manages to flee from these killers and reaches a camp with other Sámi whose inhabitants are worried if he has been able to hide his track. Afraid of the murderous people, they decide to flee to the coast. The boy stays alone to avenge his family's murder. Unfortunately, they get him before he can do anything and force him to lead them to the other Sámi. He guides them but has a plan to destroy the barbarous people before reaching the camp.","popularity":0.8968,"poster_path":"/cpJvdyNZaD3j2DUHO10Xa7vG8rJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1003,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmkameratene","origin_country":"NO"},{"id":275,"logo_path":"/2MxNWlN5b3UXt1OfmznsWEQzFwq.png","name":"Carolco Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"1987-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Northern Sami","iso_639_1":"se","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When the invader comes...the hardest path to find is survival.","title":"Pathfinder","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":72,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","title":"Veiviseren","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Tiennäyttäjä","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Pathfinder - Die Rache des Fährtensuchers","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"探路者","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Ο Ανιχνευτής","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"AR","title":"Pathfinder","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Pathfinder","type":"Dubbed Version's title"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Die Rache des Fährtensuchers","type":"TV title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikkel Gaup","original_name":"Mikkel Gaup","popularity":0.1693,"profile_path":"/pStE5P1zBvElRWQdHK1cMCJ3H7m.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Aigin","credit_id":"52fe433dc3a36847f80450cb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Svein Scharffenberg","original_name":"Svein Scharffenberg","popularity":0.067,"profile_path":"/qIO5rKGfiQt6l6Dd7i5O5mMIYhm.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tchude Chief","credit_id":"52fe433dc3a36847f80450cf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":22559,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ingvald Guttorm","original_name":"Ingvald Guttorm","popularity":0.056,"profile_path":"/bt2rteYSQYMNAGUzndaWKvYLL4K.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Vater","credit_id":"52fe433dc3a36847f80450d9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nils Utsi","original_name":"Nils Utsi","popularity":0.0902,"profile_path":"/nKJvJGaHto70ju4KnCQ0hC9fYbo.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Raste","credit_id":"52fe433dc3a36847f80450dd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22561,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nils-Aslak Valkeapää","original_name":"Nils-Aslak Valkeapää","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/fr6CSt2eM8jMltoW1spmQXOdAJs.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Siida-Isit","credit_id":"52fe433dc3a36847f80450e1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helgi Skúlason","original_name":"Helgi Skúlason","popularity":0.1087,"profile_path":"/neA65D57CCerXNf5C2Te9SLnD7K.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Tchude with Scar","credit_id":"52fe433dc3a36847f80450ef","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Sigurd Kristensen","original_name":"John Sigurd Kristensen","popularity":0.0647,"profile_path":"/A003zVyQhP3Uv7NoXBQDY52TYOs.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Tchude Strongman","credit_id":"52fe433dc3a36847f80450f7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Knut Walle","original_name":"Knut Walle","popularity":0.1432,"profile_path":"/dZiPMzodnXoUgEqCJc5JET16YKw.jpg","cast_id":30,"character":"Tchude Interpreter","credit_id":"5a42be040e0a264fd204027d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henrik H.
