After a long approach walk through quasi-desert regions, then on a huge glacier, the caravan of 700 porters arrives at the foot of Hidden Peak. The expedition was led by Henry de Ségogne, with Jean Charignon, Pierre Allain, Raymond Leininger, Jean Carle, Jean Deudon, Louis Neltner, Jacques Azémar, doctor Jeand Arlaud and director Marcel Ichac. Weather conditions, logistical problems and a strike among Sherpas forced the team to retire at 6900m on the south face. The film received the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1938.","popularity":0.3743,"poster_path":"/nKVYLXXLTcPnYpyZOyUYb8wLhhG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":196912,"logo_path":"/nRtogyDc0ZaW7SHNxlXe0ZJO92l.png","name":"Club Alpin Français
