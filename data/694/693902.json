One of the most beloved VEGGIETALES characters is the cucumber LarryBoy, a mild-mannered janitor who transforms into a plunger-clad superhero to save the residents of Bumblyburg. This collection includes two classic LarryBoy adventures: LARRYBOY & THE FIB FROM OUTER SPACE (1997), in which a little white lie ends up causing big trouble; and LARRYBOY & THE RUMOR WEED (1999), an important lesson about the power of gossip. The volume also features DAVE & THE GIANT PICKLE (1996), a retelling of the Biblical story of David and Goliath; as well as four LarryBoy cartoons rendered in traditional line-drawn animation.","popularity":0.4556,"poster_path":"/tvMOXnsM0pusOlIZP8YlVCzw2yG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3204,"logo_path":"/kHOVsKg00Fn4hixW7UwMwrng4sj.png","name":"Big Idea Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":220,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"VeggieTales: The Bumblyburg Super-Hero Value Pack","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Larry Boy: The Cartoon Adventures","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2603596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shari Belgeau","original_name":"Shari Belgeau","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5e98792e0582240013aeab4e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2603597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Graue","original_name":"Marc Graue","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5e98797df6596f0014cdb4e9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Nawrocki","original_name":"Mike Nawrocki","popularity":0.2638,"profile_path":"/30Su5P2XK9F91YGZ8MDQqGCPzgx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Larry-Boy","credit_id":"5e987999fdf8b70015a3280c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Vischer","original_name":"Phil Vischer","popularity":0.1667,"profile_path":"/8qp9W0m8ZspnfeV2T71td6LWmsr.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Bob","credit_id":"5e9879b2d144430012513b93","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":110801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Vischer","original_name":"Lisa Vischer","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":"/gV7kqOe8bJvNLDEQKEcppm5DIB8.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Junior","credit_id":"5e9879c5fdf8b70013a30876","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Nawrocki","original_name":"Mike Nawrocki","popularity":0.2638,"profile_path":"/30Su5P2XK9F91YGZ8MDQqGCPzgx.jpg","credit_id":"5e987c55b33903001aa276b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":137994,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Terry Botwick","original_name":"Terry Botwick","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e987d14b339030013a26430","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2484903,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Larry Whitaker","original_name":"Larry Whitaker","popularity":0.0585,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e987cb419ab590019478767","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Vischer","original_name":"Phil Vischer","popularity":0.1667,"profile_path":"/8qp9W0m8ZspnfeV2T71td6LWmsr.jpg","credit_id":"5e987d43b33903001aa277a4","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1547220,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Bancroft","original_name":"Tom Bancroft","popularity":0.1424,"profile_path":"/ksc5uHbe2cT6VUuh4EDjhZOMxqk.jpg","credit_id":"5e987c319defda001abbdb67","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/57XrwomXe7O2beoUgYFrZja27fD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":755,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tvMOXnsM0pusOlIZP8YlVCzw2yG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":503}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9715,"name":"superhero"},{"id":6388,"name":"tomato"},{"id":6401,"name":"vegetable"},{"id":220790,"name":"cucumber"},{"id":258703,"name":"christian"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
