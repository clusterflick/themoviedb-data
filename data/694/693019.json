She is going to live alone in an old family house in the mountains, where the noises and the strange things that happen test her weakened nerves. She becomes suspicious of the few inhabitants of the place, who seem to be creating a world of conspiracies against her. Fantastic events end up showing that sensitive people can look out and see a world that is not ours, at the risk of their lives.","popularity":0.1662,"poster_path":"/vto5GLsj3J2mdW2uVQjsJQv4aPx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6458,"logo_path":"/eT4oMUK7ODM0vvZue8yq3Ojwqf8.png","name":"INCAA","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":132314,"logo_path":null,"name":"Batata
