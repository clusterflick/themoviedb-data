An anti-establishment group, they live as squatters, rejecting drugs while practicing a philosophy of love for the universe. They also reject the values of mainstream society, as embodied by the mayor of North Vancouver, who wants to turn their “home” into a shopping centre.","popularity":0.0413,"poster_path":"/zEW8Xn7mQg6tbxiqqkcwbpiyWA3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mudflats Living","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":552059,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Robert Fresco","original_name":"Robert Fresco","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e967b603cd12c0012bcfae4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2602005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kris Paterson","original_name":"Kris Paterson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e967b7c3cd12c0012bcfafb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0227086","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.653,"height":1540,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zEW8Xn7mQg6tbxiqqkcwbpiyWA3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1006}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
