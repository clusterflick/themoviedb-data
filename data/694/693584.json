She meets Maya, who's just a bit older. They bond, flee, fight, exchange passionate declarations - The dialogue is destabilizing and enigmatic, the shots are ingenious, and the black and white imagery nothing less than majestic. A film about wandering through simple places, seen in a thoroughly improbable way, with music seeping from the sets and doors opening between trees like so many narrative threads. Above all, this is a quest for infinite love. A waking dream, part poetic experiment and part art film, for the adventurous among us.","popularity":0.2796,"poster_path":"/xG5IQBdKi4xl7LYV6j0pCgprUwm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132249,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kanif, productions tous
