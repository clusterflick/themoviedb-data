This is how Rupert Everett introduces us to the British romantic poet Lord Byron. Between 1809 and 1810, his daring and eccentric personality led him on a journey from Portugal to Istanbul, through high society gatherings, Turkish baths and brothels. He leaps from one adventure to another, passing from one lover to another, causing scandal with his wild behavior. Ironic and entertaining narrator Rupert Everett accurately recounts Byron’s feats in this episodic, on-the-road period piece produced by Channel 4.","popularity":0.388,"poster_path":"/cuvb0YEdTCEP9YMPElnlbrZxZKx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":2600,"logo_path":"/ePDVrW3gJCd3kxi8ucLckJoG3Bu.png","name":"Blast!
