But when their daughter, Peggy, and her husband, Bill Trask, have a squabble, Clarice has a plan to show the daughter just how distasteful domestic bickering appears; She enters into an agreement with Henry that they will fake a fuss to serve as an object lesson. Clarice's will to play the game and her sense of humor play out at about the same time when Henry's remarks become more pointed as the charade goes on. Their fake fight is soon a real barn-burner.","popularity":0.8748,"poster_path":"/7KdrJBRLmQ6PsF4Eey4uMm9k7Hd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1935-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Papa was the big noise... but mama had the last word!","title":"People Will Talk","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Ruggles","original_name":"Charles Ruggles","popularity":0.3605,"profile_path":"/auirQUnJ5kKBTl2p6kHtkJBNeo1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Henry Wilton","credit_id":"5e95e86fc3c8910015804a40","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":88870,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Boland","original_name":"Mary Boland","popularity":0.1474,"profile_path":"/mqQFCk1l04bnqs5prmrDkupVy8B.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Clarice Wilton","credit_id":"5e95e8885cc11d0014b324e9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leila Hyams","original_name":"Leila Hyams","popularity":0.1868,"profile_path":"/opmYXK7fBjtP7NWqMMffGQzjw1U.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Peggy Trask","credit_id":"5ed424c0fea0d7001d8830c4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29313,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dean Jagger","original_name":"Dean Jagger","popularity":0.6027,"profile_path":"/fgAzRigYun0yXqIdAYPUA4GViFq.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bill Trask","credit_id":"5ed424d4528b2e001f688634","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1082774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruthelma Stevens","original_name":"Ruthelma Stevens","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":"/hPNw3B4FdlxtaDbvoGpTHXH5CQW.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Doris McBride","credit_id":"5ed424e547c9fb001e6a32a8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":77160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cecil Cunningham","original_name":"Cecil Cunningham","popularity":0.4159,"profile_path":"/rjNxYIHdW0gZPEm2OKwteGBgA5a.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Nellie Simpson","credit_id":"5ed424f8528b2e00206e83ab","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stanley Andrews","original_name":"Stanley Andrews","popularity":0.4338,"profile_path":"/zAW09eb1f0g4OPtNkJk83ej1os5.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Willis McBride","credit_id":"5ed42507528b2e001e6ae8c8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Constantine Romanoff","original_name":"Constantine Romanoff","popularity":0.1262,"profile_path":"/z9ERbNoNfll9giTWo04jYbOW2xr.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Prettyboy Plotsky","credit_id":"5ed42515c4f552001dbcee7d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Steinke","original_name":"Hans Steinke","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Strangler Martin","credit_id":"5ed42525c4f552001fbd11b9","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Brophy","original_name":"Edward Brophy","popularity":0.2478,"profile_path":"/gxAnTjS7tnVOFdhUjkWYcsdXhWm.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Pete Ranse","credit_id":"5ed42533e4b576001e2f5791","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":85957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Edwards","original_name":"Sarah Edwards","popularity":0.0958,"profile_path":"/qhS2kgNAmcaQDy8HZMeAOGqVTE9.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Martie Beemish","credit_id":"5ed4254947c9fb001e6a3305","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":958533,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alfred Gilks","original_name":"Alfred Gilks","popularity":0.0928,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b234ac57d3780042828d50","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89683,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alfred Santell","original_name":"Alfred Santell","popularity":0.1998,"profile_path":"/pehsZ5PMKALVUkur3PQfW3LMLbx.jpg","credit_id":"60b2344bfd140b0042408f4c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2761572,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"A.W.
