The mother is the communicative centre of an Indonesian family living in the suburbs. Because she spends her time alone at home, the television gradually takes on the role of a best friend. This situation causes her to apply the values that she sees in television to her family. But the other family members get their values from different outside sources, and they always reject her values.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4BxItKCpL2tGtUi5xYtUsTfvWZx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2013-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Another Colour TV","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2725085,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yovista Ahtajida","original_name":"Yovista Ahtajida","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2028a4d9f4a60034237c9e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2725084,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dyantini Adeline","original_name":"Dyantini Adeline","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f202899c50ad20033b06560","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2725085,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yovista Ahtajida","original_name":"Yovista Ahtajida","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2028b3b4a5430037363ba2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2725084,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dyantini Adeline","original_name":"Dyantini Adeline","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2028c4c50ad20036b1b0df","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2725083,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"The Youngrrr","original_name":"The Youngrrr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f2027dfd9f4a60033243723","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3550950","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4BxItKCpL2tGtUi5xYtUsTfvWZx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlin International Film Festival","release_date":"2014-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Experimenta","release_date":"2013-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"VN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"European - Vietnamese Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2014-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Mini DocFest","release_date":"2014-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
