Mozart and Da Ponte's witty, compassionate examination of young love has ensured its lasting popularity.  Jonathan Miller’s original 1995 production for Covent Garden is dear to the hearts of London audiences and has been revived numerous times. Necessity, they say, is the mother of all invention. With no money left for costumes, Miller has the genius idea of asking Giorgio Armani to lend a hand...  This production is from Sept 2010.","popularity":0.2683,"poster_path":"/yY62rHPEMxebKOwsCWdyfxowTOl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Così fan tutte - ROH","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1569470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pavol Breslik","original_name":"Pavol Breslik","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":"/1klDGmAOvQLE7Xrz951vRZZDXuZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5e9568b45cc11d001bb270c6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1548470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stéphane Degout","original_name":"Stéphane Degout","popularity":0.0683,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5e9568bca34911001441c61e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":314831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Allen","original_name":"Thomas Allen","popularity":0.0613,"profile_path":"/7CtZcvNyySzaCd5SKxULs7bSLNl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5e9568c5db72c00012ad2e6f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":585998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Bengtsson","original_name":"Maria Bengtsson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/nNyUsGPJRmneVDcOxbqZT6UYWw8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5e9568cdc3c89100157faafb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1424070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jurgita Adamonyté","original_name":"Jurgita Adamonyté","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5e9568d4db72c00019ad2a11","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2107757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Evans","original_name":"Rebecca Evans","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5e9568e0a34911001c4192c8","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1246494,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Miller","original_name":"Jonathan Miller","popularity":0.2077,"profile_path":"/jBhQSQavORk3DZzn5mDMgtxWjW3.jpg","credit_id":"6449496605a53305661b75c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1566609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Hengelbrock","original_name":"Thomas Hengelbrock","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9568ee5cc11d0016b28352","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giorgio Armani","original_name":"Giorgio Armani","popularity":0.2518,"profile_path":"/qGKeLznwWyHXISEQX93B0ygciOc.jpg","credit_id":"5e956916c3c891001a7f9037","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2435,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yY62rHPEMxebKOwsCWdyfxowTOl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1623}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
