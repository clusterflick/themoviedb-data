EJ suffers from a rare degenerative eye disease called Choroideremia, and several years ago, he was diagnosed as legally blind. However, instead of wallowing in self-pity, EJ has responded positively to his misfortune, and he's now doing everything in his power to help raise awareness and funding for a possible cure. EJ's journey while running these marathons is an inspiring tale of strength overcoming adversity, and it's ultimately a reminder that one person can indeed make a difference.","popularity":0.0535,"poster_path":"/fkW7gBP3G9kK1lAUjsSi0fNhO2j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Running Blind","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2601141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"EJ Scott","original_name":"EJ Scott","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5e959c11c3c89100137ff378","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2771150","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":875,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fkW7gBP3G9kK1lAUjsSi0fNhO2j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":591}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
