Lee, reeling from the death of his mother, visits the home of his old friend, Monty. Given his present state of mind (and body), it’s not a pleasant visit, at least from the perspective of Monty’s well put together wife, Virginia. This bold experiment from director Elliot Conrad roars beyond the limits of plot creating an indelible portrait of a friendship and a marriage ramming into one other.","popularity":0.2629,"poster_path":"/37RnBOTgkMGWXa1YSKIjIPoIcpK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132171,"logo_path":null,"name":"Serfdom Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"It's really a beautiful picture.\"","title":"Gottlieb","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2600677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shayne Kennon","original_name":"Shayne Kennon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Monty","credit_id":"5e9506412dda890014ceeb31","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2600682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lash Dooley","original_name":"Lash Dooley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Lee","credit_id":"5e95068edc1cb400167c6056","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2420490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoni Lotan","original_name":"Yoni Lotan","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/adO9it5wJFelovRhtRhMLG6WI3C.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Ehud","credit_id":"5ed861883a99370021557c4f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1815696,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgia Warner","original_name":"Georgia Warner","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/94SWasb5fddKu3KthhqSShAArUO.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Virginia","credit_id":"5f267cef7c6de300341c5831","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2600687,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Meghann Fruin","original_name":"Meghann Fruin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9506e15cc11d001bb1e86b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2600683,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elliot Conrad","original_name":"Elliot Conrad","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9506b62dda89001bcef241","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2600685,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nick Condes","original_name":"Nick Condes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9506cb5cc11d0016b1e57c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1748644,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tymon Brown","original_name":"Tymon Brown","popularity":0.062,"profile_path":"/97MB9ny9mBxpYIYA4iWvOPzqE3D.jpg","credit_id":"5ed8615a1b157d0020559686","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2600683,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elliot Conrad","original_name":"Elliot Conrad","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed861503a993700205591d4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2665100,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lillian Ross Conrad","original_name":"Lillian Ross Conrad","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed8617cfea0d7001e8f6d01","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":556890,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Chris Benker","original_name":"Chris Benker","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed8613f96e30b0022962b6c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2665099,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alex James Schwartz","original_name":"Alex James Schwartz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed861671b157d001e57af84","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7179654","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/37RnBOTgkMGWXa1YSKIjIPoIcpK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Nobudge.com","release_date":"2018-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
