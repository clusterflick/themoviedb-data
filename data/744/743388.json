He is often late, so his employer has been threatening to fire him for a long time. In his thirty-seven, Sasha still lives with his mother, with whom he cannot find a common language. His ex-wife wants to deprive him of his parental rights and the opportunity to see his son, whom he has not seen for a long time. The overdue loans turn into serious threats from the collector. He seems to live and not feel what is going on around him. But will he be able to change something if his life is threatened?","popularity":0.0603,"poster_path":"/zeGyAQG65UEjlSh8Zyu03F4umZx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2020-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Banana","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Banan","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2561572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maxim Solopov","original_name":"Maxim Solopov","popularity":0.0693,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f61b44d5a78840035a9d391","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":232859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicholay Kovbas","original_name":"Николай Ковбас","popularity":0.1578,"profile_path":"/3nl9JVNszHAHCgCu6UPvxMCNKUa.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f61b46d069f0e0035a0a85c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1112012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dmitriy Kulichkov","original_name":"Дмитрий Куличков","popularity":0.332,"profile_path":"/fpzttqO2qzzR0uh2n3SpwG9yxbJ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f61b4731684f70039420746","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2780018,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alexandra Orlova","original_name":"Alexandra Orlova","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f61b541069f0e00379f2c58","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2288382,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Denis Tsukanov","original_name":"Denis Tsukanov","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f61b53165c26c0034075d0f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2780017,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stepan Azaryan","original_name":"Stepan Azaryan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f61b507156cc70037dcc289","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2780017,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stepan Azaryan","original_name":"Stepan Azaryan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f61b50cce5d8200369b956e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2416770,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alexey Kestner","original_name":"Alexey Kestner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f61b528ce5d8200369b9592","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2722292,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Alexandra Makieva","original_name":"Alexandra Makieva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f61b575fd7aa40038e9fb55","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2780017,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stepan Azaryan","original_name":"Stepan Azaryan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f61b48965c26c0035077b25","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2530225,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alexandr Kitaytsev","original_name":"Alexandr Kitaytsev","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f61b51f156cc70038e887a6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2530224,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anna Sokolova","original_name":"Anna Sokolova","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f61b5171684f700363dfc2b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/zeGyAQG65UEjlSh8Zyu03F4umZx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"East & West Classics and Avant Garde International Film Festival","release_date":"2020-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"BANANA (реж.
