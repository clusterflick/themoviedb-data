But as time is compressed and he flows through spirals of love and sexuality, he begins to sand down distractions and distortions to reveal an essential wound at his core.

Words can fail in cinema where dance and movement may succeed.","popularity":0.4126,"poster_path":"/a5GC8AbBbLvGbjTOPGLoggnPSii.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Liminal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":180942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Poole","original_name":"Aaron Poole","popularity":0.3813,"profile_path":"/4amEyfzcaHq8DBLpkFjmqg5wwwS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Steve","credit_id":"5f63a9aad236e6003776f11f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1362996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Piggford","original_name":"Emily Piggford","popularity":0.4529,"profile_path":"/iX4mbmnPmFhGKyfXGXlL5Pn04VE.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Amy","credit_id":"5f63a9c3ce5d8200359fcc96","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2782117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vlad Alexis","original_name":"Vlad Alexis","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Rumi","credit_id":"5f63a9e50816c70037ba7a1e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2782118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tianna SwamiNathan","original_name":"Tianna SwamiNathan","popularity":0.0809,"profile_path":"/r52o2SgBLHYzjar0lodPlzPRVPy.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Chloe","credit_id":"5f63a9f1dd926a00373dd6b6","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1128321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Abramovici","original_name":"Dan Abramovici","popularity":0.2801,"profile_path":"/4bSe5xjUVFgVLQkpCkvWQGD9tuE.jpg","credit_id":"62a9259135d1bc4f94e79ff7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10519216","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a5GC8AbBbLvGbjTOPGLoggnPSii.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cinefest Sudbury","release_date":"2021-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DC Shorts film festival","release_date":"2020-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Liminal Trailer | Directed by Dan Abramovici","key":"mlL4SfWvsSI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-04-11T01:42:46.000Z","id":"63d03482b7a15400858e1e37"}]}}}
