But today, very few Americans are benefiting from the collective wealth of our great nation. Rising wealth inequality continues to reward the rich and powerful – leaving the rest of us behind to fight over crumbs. It’s time to reimagine a new social contract. INHERENT GOOD is a 60-minute documentary starring southern comedian Trae Crowder who takes viewers on a journey to explore a transformative idea of giving free cash to every citizen – no strings attached. This big idea called Universal Basic Income is examined through personal stories of perseverance by everyday Americans living in the heartland. It’s not a matter if we deserve it, but rather do we trust each other to make basic income a reality for everyone?","popularity":0.4755,"poster_path":"/AapDILUuG6GcEGZ82TBXlZjeAhr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inherent Good","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2368923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trae Crowder","original_name":"Trae Crowder","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":"/A2HMxLpPaYhAwEyhpvNpzEz4Sts.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f628089dbcade0036131cd4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3014108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Yang","original_name":"Andrew Yang","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6051fe231d820f00282060f3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3014109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andi Morrow","original_name":"Andi Morrow","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Monopoly Player","credit_id":"6051fe2f8c7b0f0028588bb2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3014110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Drew Morgan","original_name":"Drew Morgan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/LadyTP1x8zJJr7f11EoqcJSCjZ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Monopoly Player","credit_id":"6051fe41031deb00287bd33c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3014111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Stern","original_name":"Andy Stern","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6051fe4b22e480006ad94d87","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3014112,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alma Zelleke","original_name":"Alma Zelleke","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6051fe592cde98003ec7393b","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2368923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trae Crowder","original_name":"Trae Crowder","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":"/A2HMxLpPaYhAwEyhpvNpzEz4Sts.jpg","credit_id":"64addfaee24b9300c6b0d293","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1252346,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Steve Borst","original_name":"Steve Borst","popularity":0.0901,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64addfa63e2ec8012ee57793","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1252346,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Steve Borst","original_name":"Steve Borst","popularity":0.0901,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f62805b1684f7003540afb5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8825234","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cchn8AY75eCKxf35932fy3U55D8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1274,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/AapDILUuG6GcEGZ82TBXlZjeAhr.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":901},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tDJzTvieLdsF4khN0QG3RnJIbz9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":270974,"name":"universal basic income"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"INHERENT GOOD TRAILER","key":"aoeUyEdr-Bg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-08-27T01:22:23.000Z","id":"60c910b1ca8354005704de77"}]}}}
