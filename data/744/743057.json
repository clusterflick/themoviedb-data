After a stop at the Bayrischer Hof, it moves into the Glockenbachviertel, over the Reichenbachbr체cke to the Isar, further into the suburbs. These places are not alien to residents of Munich or tourists, but Lemke knows no tour guide romance. He has the usual group of main characters, two or three girls, a young man, and sends them off as if on a great expedition. They bring along the Lemkestyle, which doesn't fit in anywhere, but works like a contrast medium. Their fantasy figures make the reality around them more real.","popularity":0.2051,"poster_path":"/bqgQegq1usHaEt0tSB0C5pVan7F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2086,"logo_path":null,"name":"Klaus
