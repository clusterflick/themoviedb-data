Dawn was in the Army, now she’s a tribal cop in the midst of the North Dakota oil boom that threatens to pull the last threads of her Native culture apart. Patty teaches indigenous women’s self-defense across the Great Plains of her people. Sarah is an attorney and scholar fighting to overturn restrictions on tribal sovereignty and increase legislative protections for Native women. Loreline and Lisa are grassroots advocates working outside of the system to support survivors of violence and influence legislative change. Chalsey is writing the first anti-sex trafficking code to be introduced to a reservation’s tribal court.","popularity":0.6316,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":151196,"logo_path":"/6ePus5NY6FEjVc2GMKsFlbAZowT.png","name":"Haptic","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":24488,"logo_path":"/qR7gDm9nMYdrqnVpksmNMhwI1ZI.png","name":"Women Make Movies","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Native Women Reclaiming Sovereignty","title":"Sisters Rising","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2092261,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Willow O'Feral","original_name":"Willow O'Feral","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6085a1ae904f6d002a11b01e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3067169,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jaida Grey Eagle","original_name":"Jaida Grey Eagle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6085a1f233a5330040d0f032","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2092257,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Brad Heck","original_name":"Brad Heck","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6085a1be33a533002affac20","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3067170,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Allison Leialoha Milham","original_name":"Allison Leialoha Milham","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6085a2028d22fc0077232ff8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":7863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tantoo Cardinal","original_name":"Tantoo Cardinal","popularity":0.7586,"profile_path":"/rxhjfygJlPwztf36iRI7UDn5dr7.jpg","credit_id":"6085a1e99a8a8a0041f94248","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2092257,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Brad Heck","original_name":"Brad Heck","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6085a1d7ffc9de006e813785","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2766218,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Razelle Benally","original_name":"Razelle Benally","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6085a22333a5330058c4ecf8","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1179838,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jennifer Ruff","original_name":"Jennifer Ruff","popularity":0.1124,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6085a20de9c0dc004139d5b4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2092261,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Willow O'Feral","original_name":"Willow O'Feral","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6085a1d02da846003f17e4b0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2092261,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Willow O'Feral","original_name":"Willow O'Feral","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f61857e069f0e00379edb3c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2092257,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Brad Heck","original_name":"Brad Heck","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f61859dfd7aa40038e99bf3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7382456","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"sistersrisingmovie","instagram_id":"sistersrisingmovie","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ef7DCK2FJjj3UuUDQpuD0diPXDj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1551,"name":"indigenous"},{"id":10322,"name":"native american"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Big Sky Film Festival","release_date":"2020-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"\"America Reframed\" series","release_date":"2021-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Sisters Rising Trailer","key":"nhnHeFb9u3k","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-07-24T17:04:32.000Z","id":"5f6e453ca6e2d2003960e020"}]}}}
