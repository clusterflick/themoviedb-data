His first duty is to arrest a pair of lovers whom he catches kissing, but when he comes upon the love-sick couple, and threatens to arrest them, his heart is softened by their tears, so he allows them to go their way with some good advice.","popularity":0.1747,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1908-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Kind-Hearted Policeman","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"A Kind-Hearted Policeman","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1167399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Deed","original_name":"André Deed","popularity":0.3646,"profile_path":"/prazmRnbuIUeHO6McGOUQHDUeOd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Le malandrin","credit_id":"629a5b0d09ed8f4aa3cf863d","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1754094","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1908-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Le Bon gendarme (1908) A Kind-Hearted Policeman [Pathé Kok version c. 1912]","key":"lqBlXDXJt2I","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-09-11T23:58:28.000Z","id":"658c3ce86728a86e8027e6a9"}]}}}
