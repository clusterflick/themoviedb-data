This unique experience is a grand biopic - where the main character is place rather than person. Through volumetric capture and virtual reality technology, we join the myriad characters throughout time who have called this particular room home. Viewers witness the echoes and reverberations of human interactions that ripple through time, connecting with those who have come before, as well as those yet to come. The innovative VR narrative invites audiences to reflect on the nature of human experience across generations.
