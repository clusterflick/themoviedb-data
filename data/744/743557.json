To a great majority, therefore, this picture will be of keen interest. The first specimen subjected to examination is the Kestrel, its method of attack and defense is shown and the care of its young is illustrated. In like manner the hawk is treated, proving that paramount characteristic of the birds of prey is an exceedingly interesting cunning combined with a ferocity of attack that holds the smaller animals on which they feed spellbound until they have been devoured.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1913-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Birds of Prey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Les Rapaces","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1169204","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1913-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
