When the jeweler refuses to accept his check, John heads to the bank for the necessary funds. En route, he passes a little shop specializing in imitation jewelry. Figuring his wife will never know the difference, he buys a cheap duplicate of the 20-grand bauble. Later on, however, he reconsiders and purchases the genuine article. But before he can reach his hotel, John is detained by saucy chorus girl Rita Bori, whom he presents with what he thinks is the imitation necklace.","popularity":0.2605,"poster_path":"/aj9rJyHVFs7itaw7XbwHMHWLG2R.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29729,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Players-Lasky Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Laughable Series of Comic Tragedies.","title":"The Smugglers","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1130578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Brian","original_name":"Donald Brian","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/g5fDNUHtqK0ufbUgw9QrZRLSShg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"John Battleby Watts","credit_id":"5f6161badb154f0037ff93fd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1053959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cyril Chadwick","original_name":"Cyril Chadwick","popularity":0.0771,"profile_path":"/49tpBAMP8khe1Wor7sbDrBlRQyV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Brompton","credit_id":"5f6161c0d8cc4a003a006f9e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1383222,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Greene","original_name":"Margaret Greene","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/uAynDIG7oVJKc2DQ6To7sYadVdO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mrs. Brompton","credit_id":"5f6161c51684f70039407106","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2779787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harold Vosburgh","original_name":"Harold Vosburgh","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/pxCh4yG9LMeKt5fisu4xI89PTu7.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Detective Gray","credit_id":"5f6161cb1bf2660037dc5d70","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2779788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rita Bori","original_name":"Rita Bori","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Sally Atkins","credit_id":"5f6161d0d8cc4a0039f98d5f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3331477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Dodsworth","original_name":"Betty Dodsworth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/A99yN7jfMgZJS4TrdPzVjdWwbNy.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"61a790f03dc31300627c4705","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1264629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alma Tell","original_name":"Alma Tell","popularity":0.0653,"profile_path":"/gfGOv2zkHVb5VgrCNAm8yRSGsCk.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mrs. Watts","credit_id":"61a79100be4b36006a75009b","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sidney Olcott","original_name":"Sidney Olcott","popularity":0.1264,"profile_path":"/6Eym8aO1nG6jDTR7Fk5UbqcpieM.jpg","credit_id":"5f6161e11684f700394071c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2779789,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Charles F.
