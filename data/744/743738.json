Translation itself is at the heart of N.P’s narrative, which details the absurdities of protagonist Kazami’s attempts to translate the short stories of fictional author Sarao Takase-- as well as her sometimes disturbing interactions with the late author’s children. The previous three translators of Takase’s writing committed suicide in mysterious circumstances and Kazami’s encounters with his daughter (and lover) Sui increasingly pull her into a world of darkly chaotic energy.","popularity":0.048,"poster_path":"/n3xA35NmuULRTpCHUWIoYGQfctD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122603,"logo_path":null,"name":"Escautville","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2020-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"N.P","video":false,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3735920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clara Spilliaert","original_name":"Clara Spilliaert","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Kazami Kano","credit_id":"6345483e9bcd0f007d31853a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3735922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikiko Kawamura","original_name":"Mikiko Kawamura","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Sui Minowa","credit_id":"63454856cdf2e6007f3252cc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3735923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hiroshi Miyamura","original_name":"Hiroshi Miyamura","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Otohiko Takase","credit_id":"6345486bf3b49a0079d549d5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3040001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saartje Van de Steene","original_name":"Saartje Van de Steene","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/2oPY9MpIQP5aeetFdzXLVAFT84E.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Saki Takase","credit_id":"634548825b4fed0091d9c3c5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3735925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariko Ikeda","original_name":"Mariko Ikeda","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Kazami's Mother","credit_id":"6345489707e281007a051e60","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3176959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kosuke Fujita","original_name":"Kosuke Fujita","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Shoji Toda","credit_id":"634548c8cdf2e6007ad257e6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3735927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fumiya Naoe","original_name":"Fumiya Naoe","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Professor","credit_id":"634548dd71ffdf007fb0f49a","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2520157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hiroshi Ashikaga","original_name":"Hiroshi Ashikaga","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634549112dffd80082121baa","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3735928,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Yukiko Tamura","original_name":"Yukiko Tamura","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63454936d6c300007f5f6945","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup & Hair"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2781097,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa Spilliaert","original_name":"Lisa Spilliaert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f628a99ce5d8200369f139a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2783222,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Inneke Van Waeyenberghe","original_name":"Inneke Van Waeyenberghe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f649aad6a2227003983151a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2781097,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa Spilliaert","original_name":"Lisa Spilliaert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f649ab784448e003769cd3d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1059,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n3xA35NmuULRTpCHUWIoYGQfctD.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":750},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gvB9Eui0e2ZKBAW2vlsUKdyizlS.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1333}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berwick Film & Media Arts Festival","release_date":"2020-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"N.P TRAILER","key":"425083195","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-06-02T10:18:08.000Z","id":"5f649bccaf3da60036286116"}]}}}
