The film is a mixture of flickery, Letraset, light, scratching and hand-drawn colours. So rapid is the movement that it makes you wonder at times if you are looking at an image or its afterimage. Could a film like Frames be damaging to your retina or neurological functions? If you sat in front of this type of film long enough, would it send you on a trip? Could it awaken a patient out of a coma? After a confronting seven minutes I felt exhausted and slightly frazzled, such is the power of the film. A Dirk de Bruyn retrospective would certainly kill me. -Glen Hannah","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/lrtps2ObcJZJQwJsulhPqZpc2cg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frames","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1351976,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dirk de Bruyn","original_name":"Dirk de Bruyn","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/bnvs5MAoCf29KzNdw2RRWSKSXz8.jpg","credit_id":"5f62a01687f3f200397c1770","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lrtps2ObcJZJQwJsulhPqZpc2cg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
