The film was inspired by the Lambda award-winning book of the same name, and dives deeper into the personal stories at the heart of this unique underground artistic scene. Featuring Alison Bechdel (Fun Home), the recently departed Howard Cruse (Stuck Rubber Baby, Gay Comix), and others, this film aims to show how DIY queer cartoonists have represented, poked fun at, and celebrated LGBTQ lives and experiences in challenging, humorous, and profound ways.","popularity":0.72,"poster_path":"/Ojw5XcK6bBWNmHZ5vM8IajLnPc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
