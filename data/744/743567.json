Vania wishes a better life searching her personal independence and identity. She experiences illegality, isolation and exploitation while she tries to find answers for life's major decisions. This is a film about emigration from a feminine point of view. It tells us the hopes and fears of a common person and consists in reflection about everyday life's reality.
