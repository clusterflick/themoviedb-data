Through Lenox's eyes, ears and encounters with Kool Keith and Cam'ron, the film presents an innocent entry point into the idolized and often explicit world of hip hop. It reconsiders the age-old parental advisory debate and realities of a kid growing up in an adult world. As Skip confronts criticism about his intentions and parenting, Lenox remains unfazed. He isn't listening to any of it. In his world, art is 'medium important' compared to school, Lego's and Minecraft. And that's why the kid is everyone's favorite artist.","popularity":0.0616,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Live Fast, Draw Yung","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2779362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yung Lenox","original_name":"Yung Lenox","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f60f4ac706b9f0039083147","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2779363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Skip Class","original_name":"Skip Class","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f60f4bcd8cc4a003afe8810","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1325524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kool Keith","original_name":"Kool Keith","popularity":0.0932,"profile_path":"/76hyyNGY28XO191Pm5eeXrYASIi.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f60f4c41684f700373dd12c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cam'ron","original_name":"Cam'ron","popularity":0.4473,"profile_path":"/q6vORZVg65Xv9L05V43rlVlBbj.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f60f4d1fd7aa40038e81181","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2754957,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stacey Lee","original_name":"Stacey Lee","popularity":0.0966,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f60f3c13f7e1d003592eecf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1078025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anthony Mathile","original_name":"Anthony Mathile","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f60f3d3156cc70036dcf975","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4257978","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"Tribeca Film Festival","release_date":"2015-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
