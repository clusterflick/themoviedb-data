Her English-speaking husband, a prominent film director, criticizes her subjective approach to filmmaking; her young son, raised in Quebec, speaks only French. Interviews with Isabel Allende and other Chilean exiles reveal a deep bond in this powerful and resonant film about language and genre, exile and immigration.","popularity":0.1363,"poster_path":"/zCtimpEwGNVKCKdRs4sA9KdqjXs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140699,"logo_path":null,"name":"7 Art
