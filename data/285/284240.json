Heart of Spain was begun by Geza Karpathi and Herbert Kline, who ultimately turned their footage over to Paul Strand, Leo Hurwitz, and Ben Maddow to make the film. It is compelling both for its shrewd formal aesthetics and as a sympathetic human document of the war.","popularity":0.1725,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":6178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Frontier Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1937-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heart of Spain","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1347523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Bethune","original_name":"Norman Bethune","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/6U6WyquBbnKV06lpMmgNK4hgTTO.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"53d7a90c0e0a260331001ca2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1347524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hazen Sise","original_name":"Hazen Sise","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"53d7a9150e0a26033d001c38","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Korvin","original_name":"Charles Korvin","popularity":0.116,"profile_path":"/4gFgLmYZLrQzka0LRUrTiKEJ3k1.jpg","credit_id":"53d7a93b0e0a260334001c4c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932635,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Herbert Kline","original_name":"Herbert Kline","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/zjg8BK2JlqCIHdnBK8j7h9iifcu.jpg","credit_id":"53d7a92f0e0a260347001c1f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131469,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leo Hurwitz","original_name":"Leo Hurwitz","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/mk3yshXb2ZMUSeV6DLc0BhuA29.jpg","credit_id":"59892065c3a3687526007b72","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131470,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Strand","original_name":"Paul Strand","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/10rw1BdClbxzfwGEMJaj8GJEZyW.jpg","credit_id":"5989202ec3a36878ab0035c0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932635,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Herbert Kline","original_name":"Herbert Kline","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/zjg8BK2JlqCIHdnBK8j7h9iifcu.jpg","credit_id":"5fb009c0735205003f142db7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10536,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alex North","original_name":"Alex North","popularity":0.1311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fb00894a22d3e003f03a872","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Korvin","original_name":"Charles Korvin","popularity":0.116,"profile_path":"/4gFgLmYZLrQzka0LRUrTiKEJ3k1.jpg","credit_id":"5fb009806262080040b2aa7e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0162986","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1937-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
