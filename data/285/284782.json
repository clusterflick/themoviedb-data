A confident woman, she first countered racist resentments and remarks with irony and wit. Jokingly, she even referred to herself as a \"Kümmeltürkin\", a derogatory German term for Turkish migrants. Yet after fourteen humiliating years, her fighting spirit has given way to resignation: Melek Tez is returning to Turkey. Blending documentary, interviews and re-enacted scenes, director Jeanine Meerapfel chronicles Melek Tez' life experience.","popularity":0.1226,"poster_path":"/ofErWKUepj69OeRtgPUi2F5MX7c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29627,"logo_path":null,"name":"Journal-Film Klaus Volkenborn KG","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1985-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Melek Leaves","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Melek geht","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4064134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melek Tez","original_name":"Melek Tez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"646294f20f36550153c754ff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4064303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gülcin Tez","original_name":"Gülcin Tez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6462a4198c44b97809614a16","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1097492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeanine Meerapfel","original_name":"Jeanine Meerapfel","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/gQ6J9TsXgsCtPwE0wfES0G2CCKZ.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self (voice)","credit_id":"6462a425dbbb420119f5d465","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195565,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Johann Feindt","original_name":"Johann Feindt","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605cceb95ed8e90054f16b28","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1097492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeanine Meerapfel","original_name":"Jeanine Meerapfel","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/gQ6J9TsXgsCtPwE0wfES0G2CCKZ.jpg","credit_id":"53dcc7670e0a2648220020bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1097492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeanine Meerapfel","original_name":"Jeanine Meerapfel","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/gQ6J9TsXgsCtPwE0wfES0G2CCKZ.jpg","credit_id":"5c979cb30e0a264cbdc0de09","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1528031,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Klaus Volkenborn","original_name":"Klaus Volkenborn","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c979cbc0e0a264cc9c0e02d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1528031,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Klaus Volkenborn","original_name":"Klaus Volkenborn","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c979cd99251416b3af56bd4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2272707,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jakob Lichtmann","original_name":"Jakob Lichtmann","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c979cf10e0a264ccec0dbb5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0089450","wikidata_id":"Q1214217","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1070,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d687S6xs3buLoAmfzO3ZjzRWzLO.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1902},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oEeH1jk3ZU4V5ASAJyL8ObpjfMU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1918},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1072,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pkiYMJXA2pMsw42x9XXSaLv4oAR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1905},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1hI7C4EJeaIZYTXmfRXr8zWJIXL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1899,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/ofErWKUepj69OeRtgPUi2F5MX7c.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1266},{"aspect_ratio":0.749,"height":774,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x8OmeTSOdRgMbUVCQOWl9esrKPv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":580},{"aspect_ratio":0.716,"height":1899,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/8XmU1HkvmdPVZQ5jxOojo4RFs1k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1360}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
