His refusal of the gift attracts the admiration of Princess Madhuri. When the nasty Ranamal, who wants to marry her, imprisons her father the king, she becomes the masked Hunterwali, 'protector of the poor and punisher of evildoers', and performer of stunts like jumping over a moving cartand fighting 20 soldiers at once. She steals Jaswant's prize horse, Punjab, but returns it later. Jaswant chances upon a nude Hunterwali bathing in the river and after a long duel captures her and takes her to Ranamal to claim his reward.","popularity":0.0998,"poster_path":"/oxNN16qsF4qit8GAsB8vAPdtqR9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48495,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wadia Movietone","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1935-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":164,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hunterwali","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Princess and the Hunter","type":"world-wide English title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2714857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Ann Evans","original_name":"Mary Ann Evans","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/bVrrkbvlexqjs2sVzY6hxkhiPrC.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Princess Madhuri aka Hunterwali (as Fearless Nadia)","credit_id":"65d49850e640d6017decc9b1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1347796,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharifa","original_name":"Sharifa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Krishnavati","credit_id":"53d8d3f5c3a3682c32001f5f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1347797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gulsham","original_name":"Gulsham","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"53d8d3fec3a3682c46001f49","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1439060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boman Shroff","original_name":"Boman Shroff","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Jaswant","credit_id":"5502f51292514174f6000e9d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1029054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Homi Wadia","original_name":"Homi Wadia","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/cEfzi3Y1Rc9qZtrQX3lmST53fIh.jpg","credit_id":"53d8d3e1c3a3682c2e001e57","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1029054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Homi Wadia","original_name":"Homi Wadia","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/cEfzi3Y1Rc9qZtrQX3lmST53fIh.jpg","credit_id":"65bebf06a7e363016053f9b0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1348635,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"J.B.H.
