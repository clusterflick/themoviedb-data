The latter asks Quasimodo, the deaf and deformed bell-ringer of the cathedral, to kidnap the girl. Quasimodo, who has been adopted by Frollo and obeys his every word, captures the gypsy but she is saved thanks to Phoebus, a handsome captain, and his archers. Arrested by Phoebus, the hunchback is condemned to be flogged at the pillory. When Esmeralada, moved to pity by his lot, gives him water to drink, Quasimodo falls in love with her. Later, Phoebus is stabbed to death and Esmeralda is wrongly accused of the murder. Sentenced to hang, she is saved by Quasimodo who offers her asylum and... the love of his heart.","popularity":0.2928,"poster_path":"/w25iyMvlumIVQaQKPW0m5dfRCu1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7981,"logo_path":"/6Yv1gIAuGkHS5Vis4UjnqHhCPWV.png","name":"Pathé","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1911-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hunchback of Notre Dame","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1125362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Krauss","original_name":"Henry Krauss","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/mfLDKcswVLTgFQ95NyWVPr7bUd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"53d8d06c0e0a261c7500217f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":102851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stacia Napierkowska","original_name":"Stacia Napierkowska","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/jX1e970q4lAAHp3dLB73LHx74UF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"53d8d0750e0a261c7b0021dd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"René Alexandre","original_name":"René Alexandre","popularity":0.0764,"profile_path":"/eo2lDk1nH6P3Fh4IEeu4dNRgcVw.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"53d8d07d0e0a261c7e0021f9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1351574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claude Garry","original_name":"Claude Garry","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/wtwIe1ZQOYF2bF8bjvzy1fge01C.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"61d39566944a57001f8cc6a2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Angelo","original_name":"Jean Angelo","popularity":0.1152,"profile_path":"/5Ta30wFchtuJaMUEEuK9cKAD96r.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"61d3956d1b722c00412e8238","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157999,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Albert Capellani","original_name":"Albert Capellani","popularity":0.1701,"profile_path":"/qELciPNN4zCstbffwkXKR84qJ66.jpg","credit_id":"53d8d0620e0a261c84002122","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37127,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Victor Hugo","original_name":"Victor Hugo","popularity":0.3915,"profile_path":"/g9AOq3TufNgZgeQyHm1J2tINtvC.jpg","credit_id":"61d3953e8c22c000413bafed","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1342312,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pierre Trimbach","original_name":"Pierre Trimbach","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d3955bd19a33008e7b43cc","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4043402,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Carré","original_name":"Michel Carré","popularity":0.0805,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6452e9ec33ad8f00e3c84eb0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0241776","wikidata_id":"Q7740945","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/w25iyMvlumIVQaQKPW0m5dfRCu1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1365}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1911-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
