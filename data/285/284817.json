True, there were others before him (Buddy Holly and Roy Orbison come to mind), but the Sir Douglas Quintet counterattacked the British invasion of the mid 1960's with their own brand of Chicano-influenced rock that they had been playing around their hometown of San Antonio. This performance, recorded October 14, 1975, came after Doug had temporarily retired the Sir Douglas name, but features original member Augie Meyer along with musical compadres Martin Steitle, John Barber, Steve McDaniels and Harry Hess.","popularity":0.4233,"poster_path":"/uydS8V8FSUqYuBH6KzZRephdPqG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28897,"logo_path":null,"name":"New West Records","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sir Douglas Quintet: Live from Austin, TX","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":977810,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doug Sahm","original_name":"Doug Sahm","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/1RhomZ08VVhPTabL2e3d1rCNPPj.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself (vocals, guitars, fiddle)","credit_id":"53dcf74dc3a3684348001282","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1242694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Augie Meyers","original_name":"Augie Meyers","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself (keyboards, guitar, vocals)","credit_id":"53dcf764c3a368433b00138c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1348675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Steitle","original_name":"Martin Steitle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself (drums)","credit_id":"53dcf775c3a3684336001377","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1348676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Barber","original_name":"Jack Barber","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself (bass)","credit_id":"53dcf780c3a368433100135d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1348677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve McDaniels","original_name":"Steve McDaniels","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself (drums)","credit_id":"53dcf789c3a368434100159f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1348678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Hess","original_name":"Harry Hess","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself (steel guitar, guitar)","credit_id":"53dcf7b5c3a3684348001292","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1348679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobby Earl Smith","original_name":"Bobby Earl Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself (guitar)","credit_id":"53dcf7c4c3a3684345001250","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1348693,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ron Rendon","original_name":"Ron Rendon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53dcfa1d0e0a2648160026a3","department":"Crew","job":"Post Production Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":559543,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jay Woods","original_name":"Jay Woods","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53dcf9270e0a264822002602","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1348690,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Clare Surgeson","original_name":"Clare Surgeson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53dcf98b0e0a2648250026bc","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":559548,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Chet Himes","original_name":"Chet Himes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53dcf93c0e0a26482b002590","department":"Sound","job":"Sound mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1348684,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"B.
