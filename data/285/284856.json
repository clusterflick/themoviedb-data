In 1968, the area has diminished to strip clubs and juke joints inhabited by Vietnam War draftees that pass through from nearby Fort Riley. Heads of the group include a wino who lost a leg in WWII, a taxi dispatcher, a saloon owner, and a crazed bag lady. The younger generation is represented by a young prostitute who is trying to get off the streets, but is forced to continue to work by a no-good boy friend and the need to feed her baby. Martin Sheen also appears as a white minister who prefers the people in the area over his own congregation.","popularity":0.6221,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":68807,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hodcarrier Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ninth Street","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541626,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Washington","original_name":"Don Washington","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Bebo","credit_id":"5657e269c3a368308b001272","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91585,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kevin Willmott","original_name":"Kevin Willmott","popularity":0.1155,"profile_path":"/5A9g34TC3GwuopS0JYFNxDH1mM3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Huddie","credit_id":"5657e27f9251416dde001319","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadine Griffith","original_name":"Nadine Griffith","popularity":0.1056,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Carrie Mae","credit_id":"5657e28cc3a368308b00127d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Byron Myrick","original_name":"Byron Myrick","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Love","credit_id":"5657e2a6c3a36830960012dc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6542,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isaac Hayes","original_name":"Isaac Hayes","popularity":0.4417,"profile_path":"/wHZOIi0LJNZ55dswVMX5AqKtMlT.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"TippyToe","credit_id":"5657e2b59251416dde00132f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Queen Bey","original_name":"Queen Bey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mama Butler","credit_id":"5657e2d7c3a36830830013bb","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":143438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaycee Moore","original_name":"Kaycee Moore","popularity":0.0586,"profile_path":"/7e3SzMwd9i5GEHNUhvfLEY0fBzB.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Pop-Bottle Ruby","credit_id":"5657e2e9c3a368309000141e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Sheen","original_name":"Martin Sheen","popularity":1.2177,"profile_path":"/m2Y3Q0uyuW6htrn2W9UWCWMkpZu.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Father Frank","credit_id":"5657e3489251416ddb0013e8","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91585,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kevin Willmott","original_name":"Kevin Willmott","popularity":0.1155,"profile_path":"/5A9g34TC3GwuopS0JYFNxDH1mM3.jpg","credit_id":"5657e3719251416dde001365","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541630,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Rebman","original_name":"Tim Rebman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5657e38fc3a36830830013ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91585,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kevin Willmott","original_name":"Kevin Willmott","popularity":0.1155,"profile_path":"/5A9g34TC3GwuopS0JYFNxDH1mM3.jpg","credit_id":"5657e3d19251416ddb001412","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1319402,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rick Cowan","original_name":"Rick Cowan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5657e3f09251416dd80013ca","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91585,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kevin Willmott","original_name":"Kevin Willmott","popularity":0.1155,"profile_path":"/5A9g34TC3GwuopS0JYFNxDH1mM3.jpg","credit_id":"5657e40bc3a36830930013d2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541631,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Troy Paddock","original_name":"Troy Paddock","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5657e4259251416de00013eb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541632,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michael Brendt","original_name":"Michael Brendt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5657e434c3a368308b0012f0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0185547","wikidata_id":"Q7039233","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
