Apparently they have no eyes for anything but the game. An unfortunate stray chicken, however, comes that way and appears on the scene. The delights of craps are immediately forgotten while all engage in chasing the fowl. Feathers fly and a scene of wild confusion ensues.\" (Selig Polyscope catalog).
