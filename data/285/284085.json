But the nurse hired to pull off this transfer refuses to go through with it, leaving each baby with its proper family. When the babies are grown, the man from the poor family (who has been led to believe that he did come from the rich family) goes to the house of the other and throws him out. The remainder of the film deals with the frustrations of mistaken identity.","popularity":0.0668,"poster_path":"/iHOjMMxRfwR0ZuCwcx8bPEXYZL4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1914-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The World, the Flesh and the Devil","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1743490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stella St. Audrie","original_name":"Stella St. Audrie","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5d1affa8532acb0011ccdffe","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1432881,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"F.
