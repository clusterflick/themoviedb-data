Trying to spare her beloved husband the ordeal, the woman turns to a family friend, Dr. Lang, to help end her life. When this doctor declines to help with the assisted suicide, however,  she is forced to turn to her husband.  After much soul-searching, Dr. Heyt, her husband, assists in her suicide. The act, however, is witnessed by a chambermaid, who reports him to the police.  Dr. Heyt is put on trial for murder and, at first, Dr. Lang testifies against him in court. Soon, however, Dr. Lang is faced with a similar case in his professional practice and this, along with Dr. Heyt’s impassioned performance in court, convinces Dr. Lang that, in some instances, mercy killing may be the right thing to do.","popularity":0.4767,"poster_path":"/nnV8GqKv0Ezn22BboBOAv6ZVzrb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7448,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tobis Filmkunst","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1941-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Accuse","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":11934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heidemarie Hatheyer","original_name":"Heidemarie Hatheyer","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":"/91xVeXGGbdiBzDe7tlCibA67UBq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Hanna Heyt","credit_id":"53d8e16f0e0a261c8400232d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Hartmann","original_name":"Paul Hartmann","popularity":0.1228,"profile_path":"/7XuDPxgxobjDzQTvwUPLcucc8YW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Professor Dr. Thomas Heyt","credit_id":"53d8e1770e0a261c7e002409","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathias Wieman","original_name":"Mathias Wieman","popularity":0.0908,"profile_path":"/lrTjCfMpZUJSvkWt6s2aqVPmXh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dr. Bernhard Lang","credit_id":"53d8e17f0e0a261c7200231b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margarete Haagen","original_name":"Margarete Haagen","popularity":0.2028,"profile_path":"/vTjwPXwDxEtB1zFHKTnT5cTEHZF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Berta Link","credit_id":"572f9b0a9251410272000636","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Florath","original_name":"Albert Florath","popularity":0.2963,"profile_path":"/ciYf1a97dXw3J3RnTpH0nPajPYk.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Prof. Schlüter","credit_id":"572f9b22c3a368496e001bc1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilse Fürstenberg","original_name":"Ilse Fürstenberg","popularity":0.105,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Marie Günther","credit_id":"572f9b329251413c270019d8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":45284,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karin Evans","original_name":"Karin Evans","popularity":0.1145,"profile_path":"/savuL4VBocYcLBnSj4rpcUlegb7.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Erna Balg","credit_id":"572f9b40c3a368496e001bc5","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Nielsen","original_name":"Hans Nielsen","popularity":0.3072,"profile_path":"/c4fuFr8SCKvUqkvXD9p8RSGGXTp.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Dr. Höfer","credit_id":"572f9b55c3a3685b5c0025d6","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz Schafheitlin","original_name":"Franz Schafheitlin","popularity":0.3509,"profile_path":"/waBnCjhX3M73pKaKDJFRyM7wKKN.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Rechtsanwalt Straten","credit_id":"572f9b6692514118d30021a1","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erich Ponto","original_name":"Erich Ponto","popularity":0.1613,"profile_path":"/rzAmMnbpSIOCJZSMghiqacc7vrj.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Prof. Werther","credit_id":"572f9b7b9251413c270019e4","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1549152,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernst Sattler","original_name":"Ernst Sattler","popularity":0.0587,"profile_path":"/1Emi6c2Qcy1qgW84fyirkWiPeVZ.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Major a.D.
