The Israelites are engaged in a bloody battle against the Philistines, and Samson is the influential judge and powerful warrior who has given the war-weary Israelites a newfound sense of hope. That hope is soon diminished, however, when the irresistible Delilah ensnares the long haired Samson in a hopeless web of passion. Samson draws power from his flowing locks, and without them he is but a mortal man. The only way to defeat Samson is to shear his formidable mane, and the temptress Delilah is the only one capable of getting close enough to do so.","popularity":0.0757,"poster_path":"/mkeu8KkQ3LA81ulkvX2Ea4mqNCc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Samson and Delilah","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1348807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Alvez da Cruz","original_name":"Charles Alvez da Cruz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"53dd60f90e0a265a8a00068c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1348808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klara Uleman","original_name":"Klara Uleman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"53dd61060e0a265a83000732","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1348806,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Corina Van Eijk","original_name":"Corina Van Eijk","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53dd60ec0e0a265a86000735","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1348806,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Corina Van Eijk","original_name":"Corina Van Eijk","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53dd61130e0a265a9900062f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1348809,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tinus Holthuis","original_name":"Tinus Holthuis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53dd61250e0a265a8600073f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0872293","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mkeu8KkQ3LA81ulkvX2Ea4mqNCc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-08-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
