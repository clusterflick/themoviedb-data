Initially disinterested, the journalist begins to uncover unflattering truths about the national hero and experiences visions in which he seems to be witnessing events that transpired over 300 years ago.  As he obsessively pursues the investigation, his personal life and his grip on reality disintegrate, drawing him relentlessly toward the fatal carnival at which Jenatsch was killed.","popularity":0.5359,"poster_path":"/tDWAFahaKLDTKupxFXnyLuMIDNK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12997,"logo_path":null,"name":"Limbo Film AG","origin_country":""},{"id":167037,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beat Curti","origin_country":""},{"id":167038,"logo_path":null,"name":"Société de Banque Suisse","origin_country":""},{"id":38696,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bleu Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":167039,"logo_path":null,"name":"Schweizer Fernsehen (SF)","origin_country":""},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1987-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jenatsch","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"デ ジャ ヴュ","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Voïta","original_name":"Michel Voïta","popularity":0.1859,"profile_path":"/sSNUp70P6nAInUxR2uXv6otFz4W.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Christophe Sprecher","credit_id":"53dd41910e0a265a8a000393","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":91573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Boisson","original_name":"Christine Boisson","popularity":0.1767,"profile_path":"/aU8dQjROQt6sqyC9yQw9s76ZtLG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Nina","credit_id":"53dd419a0e0a265a9000040b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23734,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vittorio Mezzogiorno","original_name":"Vittorio Mezzogiorno","popularity":0.2494,"profile_path":"/8xxQrh1CDcMSAxyvM4P5dWWq25I.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jörg Jenatsch","credit_id":"53dd41a30e0a265a8a000398","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Bouise","original_name":"Jean Bouise","popularity":0.2639,"profile_path":"/oRUMbNX21qfcTmxodcn3SRqkoe6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dr. Tobler","credit_id":"53dd41a80e0a265a93000388","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":7710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Betti","original_name":"Laura Betti","popularity":0.2077,"profile_path":"/7fQu63Y9LDvAKLGVprtvVBGTbi1.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Mademoiselle von Planta","credit_id":"60c38c8e8eda870029af2271","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carole Bouquet","original_name":"Carole Bouquet","popularity":1.0528,"profile_path":"/nCyI95wVvhXFH1GiornFHsL9YOx.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Lucrezia von Planta","credit_id":"60c38c969369a2004032b27a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1662202,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jean-Marc Henchoz","original_name":"Jean-Marc Henchoz","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Pompejus von Planta","credit_id":"60c38c9e9369a2002912152e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143018,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fredi M.
