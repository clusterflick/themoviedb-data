Tony recognizes the man as Jorny, mayor of Avalonia, a straitlaced town where Tony was once arrested for playing his hurdy-gurdy. After this meeting, Tony's travels take him again to Avalonia. Camped on the outskirts of town, he meets June Ramsey, a cousin of the mayor's wife, ejected from town by the mayor because his reelection campaign is jeopardized by her having been seen in a roadhouse. Under considerable pressure because he wishes to conceal his previous encounter with Tony from the opposition, Jorny returns Tony's favor by asking June's forgiveness and inviting her to return to Avalonia. June accepts his apologies; she then follows Tony, with whom she has fallen in love.","popularity":0.4739,"poster_path":"/9qd5gwqUHPTDZL8Yb5vzuluwe33.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19384,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tiffany-Stahl Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1929-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Laugh Along the Road to Romance with Mr. Antonio, His Strange Caravan and his Delightful Dialect.","title":"Mister Antonio","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Carrillo","original_name":"Leo Carrillo","popularity":0.1883,"profile_path":"/2vnSRTNNUcaay4PcnOTCqDCwjqf.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Antonio Camaradino","credit_id":"53d75fe50e0a26033d0013ae","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":532628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Valli","original_name":"Virginia Valli","popularity":0.4259,"profile_path":"/6MUPusOIZUXkj1ADgWawHeZK5Kl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"June Ramsey","credit_id":"53d75fee0e0a26033d0013b1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":156143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gareth Hughes","original_name":"Gareth Hughes","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":"/pNlzPwHTsR0qJiBPkQ2ClQu9QZY.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Joe","credit_id":"53d75ff90e0a26033a0013eb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Reicher","original_name":"Frank Reicher","popularity":0.2139,"profile_path":"/5q5kXKMDiBg7MrdcSdU5CZSQTgS.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Milton Jorny","credit_id":"53d760040e0a26033a0013ee","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugenie Besserer","original_name":"Eugenie Besserer","popularity":0.1852,"profile_path":"/fcej4GbVD6SSlwbmDotLlv68Nbt.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mrs. Jorny","credit_id":"53d7600f0e0a2603440013cb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1122375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lewis Franklin","original_name":"Lewis Franklin","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/wWZxIcLoFlIqRd2ByUY5Ukteedj.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Earl Jorny","credit_id":"53d760190e0a26033a0013f0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Ford","original_name":"Francis Ford","popularity":0.5663,"profile_path":"/v5MKJZbr5kwP7KbLjNgw7Bqwsto.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"53d760210e0a2603440013ce","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121247,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lloyd Ingraham","original_name":"Lloyd Ingraham","popularity":0.1387,"profile_path":"/rt2FD3CxxiBDcyQAUvyb9P0OasY.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"53d760280e0a26033d0013bc","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gus Leonard","original_name":"Gus Leonard","popularity":0.0752,"profile_path":"/7g5P7qb8EDDn3lojyoU6EpQSSVT.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"53d7602e0e0a26033d0013be","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1347412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viola Louie","original_name":"Viola Louie","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"53d760350e0a260347001392","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1001023,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Flood","original_name":"James Flood","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":"/hufovJD0429A7Tq7S2USM2KTyYy.jpg","credit_id":"53d75fbd0e0a26033d0013a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Reicher","original_name":"Frank Reicher","popularity":0.2139,"profile_path":"/5q5kXKMDiBg7MrdcSdU5CZSQTgS.jpg","credit_id":"53d75fd60e0a26033a0013e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148834,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Booth Tarkington","original_name":"Booth Tarkington","popularity":0.1809,"profile_path":"/pYYORhDh0s0aT1DzlNy4UqK9sPm.jpg","credit_id":"6747c4a85434388e1a589882","department":"Writing","job":"Original Film Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0020175","wikidata_id":"Q20949913","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9qd5gwqUHPTDZL8Yb5vzuluwe33.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5867,"name":"caravan"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1929-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
