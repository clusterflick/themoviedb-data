In these boondocks, a displaced Filipino family, lead by Military Commander Ricardo and his wife Julia, become acquainted with a group of Japanese officers, similarly camped nearby. Their son Joselito, a Japanese speaker, becomes the conduit with the neighboring Japanese. Their daughters Niña, an aspiring concert pianist and the musically gifted, Maria, who is able to play by ear, are alternately repulsed and intrigued by the officers. Family values are questioned as the family treads the thin line between enmity and friendship with the occupying Japanese. Based on true stories from the director's own family history, Concerto celebrates a family whose reverence for life, expressed through their love of music and friendship, can survive even war, and shows how beauty and compassion does grow in even the harshest of conditions.  - Written by anonymous","popularity":0.0976,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":19505,"logo_path":null,"name":"Roadrunner Network","origin_country":""},{"id":58376,"logo_path":null,"name":"Casa San Miguel","origin_country":""},{"id":15808,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinemalaya Foundation","origin_country":"PH"},{"id":58384,"logo_path":null,"name":"Solito Arts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2008-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Concerto","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1128306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ynna Asistio","original_name":"Ynna Asistio","popularity":0.0817,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Maria dela Torre","credit_id":"53d75f470e0a260347001362","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":140422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meryll Soriano","original_name":"Meryll Soriano","popularity":0.1409,"profile_path":"/u1598ndZBZ9AKWuPub9eGfZuDEk.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Niña dela Torre","credit_id":"53d75f530e0a26033a0013cd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1347408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Aquitania","original_name":"Jay Aquitania","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Joselito dela Torre","credit_id":"53d75f610e0a260340001444","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1092051,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shamaine Buencamino","original_name":"Shamaine Buencamino","popularity":0.1049,"profile_path":"/azNT9bphgxVw5FGd8DeXIgJ875I.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Julia dela Torre","credit_id":"53d75f6e0e0a26034700136b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1347409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nonoy Froilan","original_name":"Nonoy Froilan","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ricardo dela Torre","credit_id":"53d75f7d0e0a2603370013cf","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1490319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alyssa Marie Lescano","original_name":"Alyssa Marie Lescano","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"55b3a34492514125da012517","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1347410,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Alexander Morales","original_name":"Paul Alexander Morales","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53d75f900e0a260347001370","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1347410,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Alexander Morales","original_name":"Paul Alexander Morales","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54d89891c3a3683b8f007e53","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1244528","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
