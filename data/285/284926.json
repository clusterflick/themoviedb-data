Well, think again! Unfortunately for Lana, she encounters Marty (Clark Gregg), a cocky, beer-guzzling plumber who is sent to Lana's address by mistake. He thinks he's stumbled upon a beautiful young business woman's attempts to seduce him. And she thinks he's the doctor that responded to her ad - although, with his tool kit in hand and his name printed on his shirt, he's a bit different than what she imagined. When the real doctor calls, life for Lana becomes even more complicated. What follows is a hilarious adventure of failed romance and twisted human relationships. Will Lana get her pipes checked? Will Marty get his tool kit back? Does it really pay to advertise?","popularity":0.3737,"poster_path":"/5NhZy9emZEEGf5XE9EjDu02CUR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lana in Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1021557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daphna Kastner","original_name":"Daphna Kastner","popularity":0.1096,"profile_path":"/4k8ZTegyk0djAbH7ZhFvcETmnBp.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lana","credit_id":"53ddd1590e0a265a8d00153d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clark Gregg","original_name":"Clark Gregg","popularity":1.6977,"profile_path":"/zwyhwrxgpiufSPpjC9dxCy5kAB0.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Marty","credit_id":"53ddd18e0e0a265a9900142c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1348940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Eyton-Jones","original_name":"Susan Eyton-Jones","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Kate","credit_id":"53ddd1a60e0a265a8d00155a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":292193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan E.
