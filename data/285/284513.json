Monsieur Broc, a town hall employee, discovers his daughter is taken with Alban. When he rejects her, she collapses. Suddenly, the river rises and floods the village. One evening, Margot disapears… This peasant drama, adapted from a novel by André Corthis and shot during an actual flood of the Rhone, was Delluc’s last. The human madness is an echo to nature’s fury, magnified by moving images of a Provence submerged by water and mist.","popularity":0.0528,"poster_path":"/qzghdo91vw5MquDSKUUYN6Ebnl6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1924-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Flood","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1001945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ève Francis","original_name":"Ève Francis","popularity":0.0605,"profile_path":"/reFIqAeKnQ7ju8LqvAayeQFLytp.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Germaine Broc","credit_id":"53da26d9c3a3681eea001c70","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edmond van Daële","original_name":"Edmond van Daële","popularity":0.135,"profile_path":"/UyMRqHMEtS4L8ohmMHH5cmw0L2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Broc","credit_id":"53da26e0c3a3681ed0001405","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Hériat","original_name":"Philippe Hériat","popularity":0.2026,"profile_path":"/nNI7fWO0k7t59KzBrqJbz6yVmR9.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Alban Perrin","credit_id":"53da26e7c3a368623600002a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1656267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ginette Maddie","original_name":"Ginette Maddie","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/SFEDlkOL7qhVZADcef3JJonlTY.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Margot Doucet","credit_id":"57963bb9c3a3683c57000587","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1263035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Prélia","original_name":"Claire Prélia","popularity":0.1406,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Margot's mother","credit_id":"57963bc3c3a3682923009f63","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1057974,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Delluc","original_name":"Louis Delluc","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":"/tRBryDkoT0jTaA3Pxy9sAjb1wkH.jpg","credit_id":"541c2e8e0e0a26123c00400c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1446930,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alphonse Gibory","original_name":"Alphonse Gibory","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6368ecf366565a007a457a51","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1057974,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Delluc","original_name":"Louis Delluc","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":"/tRBryDkoT0jTaA3Pxy9sAjb1wkH.jpg","credit_id":"6368ecddebb99d009089ed91","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3240854,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrée Cortis","original_name":"Andrée Cortis","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6368ece91684f7007f78f05f","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1995434,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Georges Lucas","original_name":"Georges Lucas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6368ed0e9653f6007af6823b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0231794","wikidata_id":"Q3204209","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2035,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sUmWWndBXcPV4TNbF6DJVMiEQIW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3619}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/qzghdo91vw5MquDSKUUYN6Ebnl6.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1380,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/fpNMaSf3WzHtdGu2nOvkoAl3EAW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":920},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/281M5UFFPkQxDbRQ04FKqBDl8a8.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1929,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/2ii4NEoStbArS6UJ3N4grdb5ql7.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1286}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1924-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
