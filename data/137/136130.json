Except as actors, no Americans took part in the production. The three-hour film was made for television and evidently had no theatrical release, but is available on DVD for home viewing.  A combination of dramatisation, historical footage, and eyewitness interviews, the film alternates between documentary footage and the dramatic recreations. Both the dramatisations and most of the original footage are presented as sepia-toned images, serving to blur the distinction between them. The languages are English and Japanese, with subtitles, and the actors are largely Canadian and Japanese.","popularity":1.1132,"poster_path":"/9E2WuVGDTXlmdBzE6MO1e9DAA8o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":190,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The grisly events leading to the first attack with a nuclear weapon.","title":"Hiroshima","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wesley Addy","original_name":"Wesley Addy","popularity":0.1962,"profile_path":"/j0DmXhowoVNXR21jQy9QhTD8BOz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Secretary of War Henry L.
