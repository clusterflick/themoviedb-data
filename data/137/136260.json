And when the government decides to curb this right, the whole village quietly rises up in a comical rebellion.  After their vessel runs aground during a storm and is impounded by the British authorities, local smugglers must find a way of disposing of their contraband brandy cargo before it's discovered by the Customs Officers.","popularity":1.2685,"poster_path":"/uO9QKV9LjU3GADu2u1urmqdfLOS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13724,"logo_path":"/3j4cIV80cyoKW2oEE1obGw4C9vB.png","name":"A.C.T.
