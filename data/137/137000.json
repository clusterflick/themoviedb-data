The film is an ode to the texture, the beauty, the singularity of aging faces and silhouettes, a hypnotic poem in the Dwoskin meaning of the term which is long observations of very tiny details. A gesture, a pause, a look, a moment. Throughout his films intimacy has always played a leading role and this is also true for Age is..., all the faces being close friends, or close friends relatives and sometimes even Stephen himself.","popularity":0.3324,"poster_path":"/dvf6oQba1jK6bA5AohlVp0A7O6V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74860,"logo_path":"/pTTMbWTvq1cLOPSk2tkFuaD88hq.png","name":"House on Fire","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":93404,"logo_path":null,"name":"Centre National des Arts Plastiques (CNAP)","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":311,"logo_path":"/TNGvZ8zOklntjPP3EcsHtrR8Rc.png","name":"PROCIREP","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":309,"logo_path":"/eVdJe4ha50lW1Eop1tq93TMh1XW.png","name":"Angoa-Agicoa","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":310,"logo_path":"/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png","name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Age Is...","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1364039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antoine Barraud","original_name":"Antoine Barraud","popularity":0.1219,"profile_path":"/9F9OhMf3KzMNwjegYCwOy4a699T.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f5043c04cd912003678aec3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2422531,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gilles Bénardeau","original_name":"Gilles Bénardeau","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f5043d44cd912003477b3eb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2764310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Françoise Bridel","original_name":"Françoise Bridel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f5043de498ef90038a299b0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1132633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tonino De Bernardi","original_name":"Tonino De Bernardi","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/6t3K7VZymqWMpJKifzN6xEFlPqK.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f5043e5c5840d003979a6df","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1605376,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mary Dickinson","original_name":"Mary Dickinson","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5f5043eea1074b0034ee7d2c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2764311,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michele Fuirer","original_name":"Michele Fuirer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5f5043f6f29d6600315e5608","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2049968,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rachel Garfield","original_name":"Rachel Garfield","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5f5043fff29d6600335e0d14","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2764312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samantha Granger","original_name":"Samantha Granger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5f504410439be10035690397","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2764313,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexis Kavershine","original_name":"Alexis Kavershine","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5f504417fba625003525f381","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1304690,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anthea Kennedy","original_name":"Anthea Kennedy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5f5044236782590032cd8f00","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2764316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"S.
