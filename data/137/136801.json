The group initially attempts to rationalize the occurrences, but they soon escalate into horrifying paranormal events and, ultimately, the apparent possession of Giorgio.  Desperate, the terrorized group pleads with the local priest to exorcise the unholy force. But its demonic powers may be more than he can handle… and a bigger menace than any of them could have imagined.","popularity":0.3731,"poster_path":"/7qP8MzapfdojnV3o02QOTVTte2Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25196,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Talking
