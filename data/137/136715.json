It provides an inside look at women's roles in the strike. The film was one of the first to put together archival footage with contemporary interviews of participants and helped spur a series of films on left and labor history in the US utilizing this technique. The film was also important in helping bring into view the history of American women being active in the public sphere, particularly in union and labor actions. The film was, further, ground breaking because it was produced and directed by women. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.","popularity":0.2774,"poster_path":"/ehoMsWpsKq9d1SP3807NCrBMQqh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160837,"logo_path":null,"name":"Women's Labor History Film Projecta","origin_country":""},{"id":160838,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Day Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1978-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"With Babies and Banners: Story of the Women's Emergency Brigade","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1106126,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lorraine Gray","original_name":"Lorraine Gray","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c1bc3a368484e1a7811","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1106126,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lorraine Gray","original_name":"Lorraine Gray","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56b208a3c3a36862210030a8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1572014,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anne Bohlen","original_name":"Anne Bohlen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56b208c092514171f1001d27","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1572015,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lyn Goldfarb","original_name":"Lyn Goldfarb","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56b208e19251414cea000128","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0078501","wikidata_id":"Q8027968","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ehoMsWpsKq9d1SP3807NCrBMQqh.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dA5g8sBkCauTDnZzzTkHAvz4K54.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6346,"name":"trade union"},{"id":159783,"name":"labor strike"},{"id":164400,"name":"labor union"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
