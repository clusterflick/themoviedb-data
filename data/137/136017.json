One thing it is never is immaterial.  The film manages to break down the Middle East conflict into individuals and to show what enormous influence it has, even into the most intimate of spheres.","popularity":0.1262,"poster_path":"/3RnwE60fsItpedo6SS3fallHr5e.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2011-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Would You Have Sex With an Arab?","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Acteurs Inconnus","original_name":"Acteurs Inconnus","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c0cc3a368484e1a44b1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1104855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yolande Zauberman","original_name":"Yolande Zauberman","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/s3TUxyhV4fAv7oWfdreMaXGKYhp.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c0cc3a368484e1a448f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1104858,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Basile Belkhiri","original_name":"Basile Belkhiri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c0cc3a368484e1a44a7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1104855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yolande Zauberman","original_name":"Yolande Zauberman","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/s3TUxyhV4fAv7oWfdreMaXGKYhp.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c0cc3a368484e1a44b7","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1104857,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Selim Nassib","original_name":"Selim Nassib","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c0cc3a368484e1a4495","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1104855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yolande Zauberman","original_name":"Yolande Zauberman","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/s3TUxyhV4fAv7oWfdreMaXGKYhp.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c0cc3a368484e1a44bd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":213259,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yves Chanvillard","original_name":"Yves Chanvillard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c0cc3a368484e1a449b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":213260,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nadim Cheikhrouha","original_name":"Nadim Cheikhrouha","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":"/4aYFqFAONcuFGLPwJjQNkfDhr3F.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c0cc3a368484e1a44a1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1104859,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Idit Bloch","original_name":"Idit Bloch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c0cc3a368484e1a44ad","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1995494","wikidata_id":"Q3570065","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zCUsJkiQNbQjpmP0jdb07oXwMI5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/3RnwE60fsItpedo6SS3fallHr5e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"Venice Film Festival","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
