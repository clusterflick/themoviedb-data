Ana finds herself a summer job as an intern for CCN, a radio station, along with several other graduates. But the working environment isn't all its caught up to be... at least it's not what they had in mind. Overbearing and demanding supervisors who will make their lives impossible, make them realize soon enough the difficulty of getting a real job once the internship comes to an end. Ana, intelligent and remarkably funny, decides to take full leadership in rebelling with the other interns. Prepare yourself for a rollercoaster of hilarious situations in which love, jealousy and way too much partying takes place!","popularity":0.3649,"poster_path":"/Lxs3L6irjKNl0b91pGvS3wbhvj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2004-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diario de una becaria","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":275949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramón Langa","original_name":"Ramón Langa","popularity":0.2721,"profile_path":"/xqF6bJrJOOac88IVgPVVl3fX869.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Luis","credit_id":"52fe4c1cc3a368484e1a7c1b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Hortelano","original_name":"Antonio Hortelano","popularity":0.1306,"profile_path":"/cL24L5LwF3b7WREjomSrAZVl7bu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Marce","credit_id":"52fe4c1cc3a368484e1a7c1f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1154731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniela Costa","original_name":"Daniela Costa","popularity":0.2023,"profile_path":"/fKCdDBqmmMoEw3kdeL1q1vMnomU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ana","credit_id":"5572f05a925141456e000066","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":180202,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josep Linuesa","original_name":"Josep Linuesa","popularity":0.1098,"profile_path":"/u6Htou10bRZxGmPgdK4OzzvrqHG.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Koldo","credit_id":"5572f06ac3a3687094001762","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":17523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cristina Brondo","original_name":"Cristina Brondo","popularity":0.1173,"profile_path":"/czjecyVfFq2yJE4ZPbM9tLWDX22.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"María","credit_id":"5572f0d992514110f9002076","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alejo Sauras","original_name":"Alejo Sauras","popularity":0.2277,"profile_path":"/mdqxyeniyvLw7pAH1VBA0PUJPf0.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Raúl","credit_id":"5572f0ecc3a3686ef9001740","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Unax Ugalde","original_name":"Unax Ugalde","popularity":0.4573,"profile_path":"/t4jKbvmXSjMBnZZjNZEr3P46q6s.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Marcos","credit_id":"5572f1029251416af7003970","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1405731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillermo Ortega","original_name":"Guillermo Ortega","popularity":0.3415,"profile_path":"/n1JFmmUMZrPasXmxkNlyTQk89K1.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Policía","credit_id":"5572f124c3a3686f580017ed","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":138715,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josetxo San Mateo","original_name":"Josetxo San Mateo","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c1cc3a368484e1a7c17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4901281,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ricardo Luis González","original_name":"Ricardo Luis González","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a4bafdaca91da4ba85bf18","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2013154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nacho Abad","original_name":"Nacho Abad","popularity":0.048,"profile_path":"/aCgEd9zMiHuzRgfUdZF4OHk2kw8.jpg","credit_id":"67a4bb09aca91da4ba85bf39","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0346866","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Lxs3L6irjKNl0b91pGvS3wbhvj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
