Bush should be prosecuted for the deaths of American soldiers in Iraq because he deliberately took our nation to war under false pretenses. Based on Bugliosi's New York Times bestseller, the movie discloses shocking hidden details of how Bush and his people systematically lied to Congress and the country. He shows incontrovertible evidence that Bush, Cheney, Rice, et al committed a monumental crime under our constitution and the laws of this land. He leads us through a legal understanding of what is needed to bring a formal prosecution, setting the stage for what would be the biggest and most important trial in U.S. history.","popularity":0.7183,"poster_path":"/aHfq8ArP7sjl4X00GLJ26oavSV1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's time for justice","title":"The Prosecution of an American President","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent Bugliosi","original_name":"Vincent Bugliosi","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4c13c3a368484e1a56fb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1105420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth de la Vega","original_name":"Elizabeth de la Vega","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4c13c3a368484e1a56ff","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":585015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Dershowitz","original_name":"Alan Dershowitz","popularity":0.3136,"profile_path":"/db6q6R2gsmrtPRXs1097gTxOE2a.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4c13c3a368484e1a5703","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1105421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Ides","original_name":"Alan Ides","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4c13c3a368484e1a5707","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62696,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David J.
