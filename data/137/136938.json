It is exactly what you call a light hearted movie that never takes itself too seriously. Liu Kai Chi impresses as the guy who never gives up on his dream and at the same time dealing with the fact that he is a failed father. Fiona Sit suits up well in a role that requires more than on paper. At the end of the day, this is an interesting and easily missed little film that works. The Way We Were may not make a single cent at the box office, but it is certainly the most underrated Hong Kong film of the year…","popularity":0.2861,"poster_path":"/tyzl9ts3rwoPV4nFs6wwgrneMwX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Way We Were","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"Suan Le Ba Pa","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":137132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fiona Sit Hoi-Kei","original_name":"薛凱琪","popularity":0.7056,"profile_path":"/9obXBdd4WctLY4QBwo2IHszkX93.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Kiki","credit_id":"52fe4c21c3a368484e1a8d15","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116423,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liu Kai-Chi","original_name":"廖啟智","popularity":0.7004,"profile_path":"/tOqH5blJzabTfM9dk6EWQ6uIDz7.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"廖祥貴","credit_id":"5a940f91c3a36824f9030ecc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1123831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pakho Chau","original_name":"Pakho Chau","popularity":0.3682,"profile_path":"/yhCcx2GXlIhrppiVW6vkbmIiNRX.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5a940f9a925141418302bafe","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tats Lau Yee-Tat","original_name":"劉以達","popularity":0.3625,"profile_path":"/8UVwCgTn5TLFEGwsRl6UaQhJC8g.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"黑達明","credit_id":"5a940fa10e0a2616c3031dd6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pal Sinn Lap-Man","original_name":"單立文","popularity":0.6183,"profile_path":"/9efm5ogg9PzhDwSCCWzqevfo1iV.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5a940fb90e0a265c4e01d0cf","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1106517,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lau Kin-Ping","original_name":"Lau Kin-Ping","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c21c3a368484e1a8d0b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106518,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hui Shu-Ning","original_name":"Hui Shu-Ning","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c21c3a368484e1a8d11","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.684,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tyzl9ts3rwoPV4nFs6wwgrneMwX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1401}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
