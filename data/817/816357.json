Audubon was also a gifted painter. His life’s work in the form of the classic book ‘Birds of America’ is an invaluable documentation of both extinct species and an entire world of imagination. During the same period, early industrialisation and the expulsion of indigenous peoples was in full swing. The gorgeous film traces Audubon’s path around the South today. The displaced people’s descendants welcome us and retell history, while the deserted vistas of heavy industry stretch across the horizon. The magnificent, broad images in Jacques Loeuille’s atmospheric, modern adventure reminds us at the same time how little - and yet how much - is left of the nature that Audubon travelled around in. His paintings of the colourful birdlife of the South still belong to the most beautiful things you can imagine.","popularity":0.8669,"poster_path":"/f72SeQ2NYOJP0QdIrwY7thwfJaw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6274,"logo_path":"/ngZoa368SAnERTz3IBvgTT4eWeB.png","name":"MK2 Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":154746,"logo_path":null,"name":"Météores Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Birds of America","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2211566,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Lœuille","original_name":"Jacques Lœuille","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606f8154dff66e004003ef09","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14686256","wikidata_id":"Q112130366","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oJ7Srdr0M1QYrbFSStgFIE7vrV6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/f72SeQ2NYOJP0QdIrwY7thwfJaw.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6JTOlZQ9q2KnINcOJ3YNh0XILKk.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jMqYnWbVchGonaA8hJ4oLxSw7g6.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2149,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/8U0clrk2RsUiLlCoysqwjVC77Rt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1433}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3134,"name":"louisiana"},{"id":4434,"name":"interview"},{"id":18007,"name":"birdwatching"},{"id":178027,"name":"environmental destruction"},{"id":221355,"name":"nature documentary"},{"id":229777,"name":"expert opinion"},{"id":238508,"name":"environmental issues"},{"id":240242,"name":"birds"},{"id":257092,"name":"industrial pollution"},{"id":262228,"name":"observational documentary"},{"id":262408,"name":"french painter"},{"id":272851,"name":"environmental documentary"},{"id":281331,"name":"extinct animals"},{"id":281332,"name":"extinct animal"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"CPH DOX","release_date":"2021-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"VOD","release_date":"2022-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD","release_date":"2022-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2021-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
