Eckersberg! – works on mastering the motifs of nature. It’s not going so well. Therefore, he embarks on an educational journey to the island of Møn, where a transformation begins. Ancient folk tales and figures borrowed freely from Norse mythology meet hypermodern high-tech in a lavishly baroque adventure. Like a spiritual relative of Matthew Barney, he lets its hybrid characters explore the historical past and possible futures at the same time.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/16sapHC7ORHRyliJgIQNEZPVbri.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Picturesque Beast","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3044608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Theodor Præst Nymark Jensen","original_name":"Theodor Præst Nymark Jensen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606ff492e92d830057892d72","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/16sapHC7ORHRyliJgIQNEZPVbri.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
