When his beloved wife passes away, he reaches for filmmaking as a way to give his grief a form. ‘The Banality of Grief’ is a cinematic love letter to a loved one and to the places where they shared their lives for 35 years. South Africa, the USA, their shared home by the water. The boundaries between past and present end in an impressionistic and deeply personal film, where existential and artistic thoughts are countered by new impressions, which testify that life is the greatest of them all. Jon Bang Carlsen is a rare and precious figure in Danish cinema. An adventurer with an ever-recording camera, who directs his gaze outwards even when his thoughts are turned inwards.","popularity":0.1176,"poster_path":"/sGy7eqjuvst5d1vnnqm72fPNet2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131093,"logo_path":null,"name":"C&C Productions","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2021-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Banality of Grief","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1172089,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Bang Carlsen","original_name":"Jon Bang Carlsen","popularity":0.0663,"profile_path":"/qwPxGQ6IKuW7gt6JB034CKkHXtj.jpg","credit_id":"606ff0c481da39002a5c1a1d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15185172","wikidata_id":"Q110892400","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":1427,"iso_639_1":"da","file_path":"/sGy7eqjuvst5d1vnnqm72fPNet2.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zhqVQ29YGEoQGH0FP3FnTHyIIgP.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"CPH:DOX","release_date":"2021-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
