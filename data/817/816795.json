In the earliest days of the early Church, God called the first missionaries to this region. Gospel opposition and Gospel opportunity would go hand in hand as churches were established amid paganism and persecution. Jesus’ servants continue to come here—a new generation of Pauls and Timothys, Aquilas and Priscillas. Walk with these believers as they give the Gospel, show mercy to the poor and hurting, and extend God’s gracious offer of life to all who will receive it.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/fX2mMw6XeHtvjoKJFxT1UnnU3m2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Luke's Dispatches: Turkey - City On A Hill","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fX2mMw6XeHtvjoKJFxT1UnnU3m2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
