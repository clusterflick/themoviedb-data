What intensifies the situation, is that it's located just 30 miles from Downtown Los Angeles.  For twenty years, this nuclear meltdown was concealed from the public eye; the resulting contamination never to be fully eradicated. Years of\r subsequent investigations have uncovered a number of catastrophic accidents that occurred on the site as well as decades of improper handling of radioactive materials, including the practice of open air burn pits that spread clouds of radioactive waste across the surrounding valley.  SSFL is now believed to be one of the most contaminated sites in the world.","popularity":0.0407,"poster_path":"/a1Ug808yEviET9Z75KP84UejdYM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Cancer moves faster than bureaucracy","title":"In the Dark of the Valley","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1727116,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicholas Mihm","original_name":"Nicholas Mihm","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6070817281da39004152512d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1727116,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicholas Mihm","original_name":"Nicholas Mihm","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6070814c81da390041525109","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1727116,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicholas Mihm","original_name":"Nicholas Mihm","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6070811c9979d20029b40cdb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3045268,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Martina De Alba","original_name":"Martina De Alba","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6070816781da39005750e354","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11684668","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a1Ug808yEviET9Z75KP84UejdYM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Cleveland International Film Festival","release_date":"2021-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"In the Dark of the Valley | Trailer","key":"527030898","site":"Vimeo","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-03-21T22:28:00.000Z","id":"607080530929f6006e367573"}]}}}
