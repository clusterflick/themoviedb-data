But the two brothers are at very different places in their lives. Popal was granted asylum in Denmark a long time ago and he is a fighter full of dreams for the future. Darmal, on the other hand, has just arrived in Denmark, with a heavy heart and lots of insecurities about his future. When Darmal’s asylum case is rejected, the brothers’ dream of a future together shatters. With a caring pastoral couple, as his closest allies, the ever so resourceful Popal gets hold of a human rights lawyer and goes all in on keeping Darmal above water. But can reality match the brothers’ dream of a future together? And is Darmal still the same brother, he once was so close with? With sibling love as its driving force – and the pastoral couple as mediators when the brothers clash - Kathrine Ravn Kruse’s gripping film is a story about a brother’s struggle not to lose his little brother once again.","popularity":0.0822,"poster_path":"/ldc7XFPYv2E8qogrj7lMVgPPtiq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2021-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Follow You Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1459886,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kathrine Ravn Kruse","original_name":"Kathrine Ravn Kruse","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625e9fbfbb260251c54693e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14552768","wikidata_id":"Q117311045","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ldc7XFPYv2E8qogrj7lMVgPPtiq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"CPH DOX","release_date":"2021-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
