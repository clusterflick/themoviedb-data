And what do you do when you have tried everything? You call on the spiritual dimension for help! The collective performance project ‘The Healing’ must expel the evil forces before it’s too late and before 60% of the residents risk being forcibly relocated. With contributions from young and old – and with a deeply dedicated chairman of the residents’ association as their anchor – the community gets creative.
