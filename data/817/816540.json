Her father took care of her with love and affection. Today, she returns to the tragic loss to understand who her mother was and how her father experienced it. Old video and audio recordings from the 1990s bring back shared memories and strengthen the bond between father and daughter in a moving but warm and funny film about an exceptional relationship. Her father’s story of how he met Smilla’s mother is almost an entire film in itself, told with a twinkle in the eye by an incredibly likeable man.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/7ze0Ff20Akcc3ViCcyUDQtUUF53.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tapes - Tell Me Everything","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3044579,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Smilla Khonsari","original_name":"Smilla Khonsari","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606fefce9979d200401dcea0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7ze0Ff20Akcc3ViCcyUDQtUUF53.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
