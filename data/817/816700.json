Everything is already there. But, in the end, without her, without her 22 films, the history of world cinema would be incomplete. In our country, her name has become one of the undisputed geniuses-Tarkovsky, Parajanov, Herman, Sokurov. The brilliant Kira Muratova looks at a person with irony, as if from a distance and from above, as if at a funny puppet theater, but her gaze is full of sympathy. It divides artists into two categories: preachers and gamblers. Of course, he considers himself one of the latter. Chance is her muse. Improvisation is a feature of the method. And what is life but improvisation? In contrast to Rene Clair with his phrase \" my film is ready. It remains only to remove it\", goes to the set, opening up to life, the game of chance.","popularity":0.1818,"poster_path":"/7q6rYMZNhclUq9HXdroRGNmSgY5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65960,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fishka Film","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2019-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Furtively About Kira","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1320610,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Yevhen Holubenko","original_name":"Yevhen Holubenko","popularity":0.1206,"profile_path":"/eBirpaRo88F1ldA31On1LGYhmaX.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66d6fec1abd65fa1fedf81c9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":32564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renata Litvinova","original_name":"Рената Литвинова","popularity":0.4376,"profile_path":"/hnUCQmHPsnjlnNnGPJ0sf2g8L9R.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66d6fed853b2e2fa0a5041f8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":141646,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Natalya Ryazantseva","original_name":"Наталья Рязанцева","popularity":0.122,"profile_path":"/5jfLDgf4lUnKI4zGgg0jVA41H42.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"66d6fee12fa1a4e760946af8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1163607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalya Buzko","original_name":"Наталья Бузько","popularity":0.1423,"profile_path":"/nn8LsDLCpvpZaPeQYlM9iAd7exo.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"66d6ff22afdebb2f399d32bd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":143679,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vera Storozheva","original_name":"Вера Сторожева","popularity":0.25,"profile_path":"/tgxhOv5XalkOuS2MrZ3cyC2pbCb.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"66d6ff2d278f6ae1dab82188","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1717229,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergei Popov","original_name":"Sergei Popov","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":"/ncNpmjFf5SXQKZs5XRPdZZMBePB.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"66d6ffab7d53fb69bddd5686","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4920627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elena Vasilyeva","original_name":"Elena Vasilyeva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"66d700196801f001e06603f9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":257628,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kira Muratova","original_name":"Kira Muratova","popularity":0.0935,"profile_path":"/dzZ9XaGVSAcHDlytr1qj6hcJUJs.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Archive footage","credit_id":"66d6ff70527e5b6119056047","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2182577,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irina Vasilyeva","original_name":"Irina Vasilyeva","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607086460929f60058c27779","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1287863,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Irina Uralskaya","original_name":"Ирина Уральская","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/3AbX5fIWtoapeVK3jn4mi2b0WgX.jpg","credit_id":"62526ad32f1be049be131c42","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2182577,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irina Vasilyeva","original_name":"Irina Vasilyeva","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62526abf447f9c0067b5a2cc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2182582,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alexandr Radov","original_name":"Alexandr Radov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62526acc5a07f5005004fc2b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12320710","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7q6rYMZNhclUq9HXdroRGNmSgY5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
