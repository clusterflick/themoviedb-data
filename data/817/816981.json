The animated sculptures made of pebbles present us with short stories. The soundtrack of the animation - original arrangements of melodies from Karlheinz Stockhausen's \"Music Boxes\" - is performed by Gidon Kremer and the musicians of his orchestra Kremerata Baltika.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Images d'Orient","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3046547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sandro Kancheli","original_name":"Sandro Kancheli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6071e48478570e005791b014","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1656280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gidon Kremer","original_name":"Gidon Kremer","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/AkErB3GvV1tSjUOy3YIVUG0o15a.jpg","credit_id":"6071e492839d930077449573","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
