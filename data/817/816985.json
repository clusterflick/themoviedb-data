The houses in it, almost to the roofs, are covered with sand, and the streets are somewhere deep under the sand dunes. From a distance, this village can be mistaken for an abandoned one. But people live there. The film tells the story of the dramatic transformation of Shoina-a thriving fishing village-into a dying village, almost completely buried in the sand.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/j8qDbjv5feqi3fpF529jgHbckZP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Between Sky and Sand","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3046555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vadim Kondakov","original_name":"Vadim Kondakov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6071e61b498bc2006c7fd3da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":752,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j8qDbjv5feqi3fpF529jgHbckZP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
