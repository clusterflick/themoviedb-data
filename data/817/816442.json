Contemporary television resembles a gigantic farm; the lure of success and fame which it offers is analogous to Pinocchio's experience when he was assured that he would never have to work again (lifelong entertainment) - and was transformed into a donkey! Individuality does not exist; Don Quichotte is not alone in believing in windmills.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Que Sera Sera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2586360,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Derek Woolfenden","original_name":"Derek Woolfenden","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606fb9bb1ad93b0029615593","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
