As a young black woman from the working class, it is a dream that requires stamina – and she has plenty of it. Raja Amari’s film follows her up to the election in 2019 when she is on the streets to gather votes and give especially young people renewed faith in democracy in a polarised society plagued by racism and inequality. A smaller film might turn a blind eye on realism in favour of a good story, but here both Ghofrane nor Amari are aware of the exhausting struggles that have to be overcome before she can bring about the change she so fervently longs to see happening. An inspiring film about a true idealist and a rich image of a society full of contrasts.","popularity":0.0725,"poster_path":"/e8qqQoIvDM8F5KdrHWCp0csksqs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TN","name":"Tunisia"}],"release_date":"2021-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"She Had a Dream","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"Tunisie","title":"Ghofrane et les promesses du printemps","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3046503,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ghofrane Binous","original_name":"Ghofrane Binous","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6071d5392f791500769d73c0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":139385,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raja Amari","original_name":"Raja Amari","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/dB9T70B24Ul4X5mr5EV5LBP6ge5.jpg","credit_id":"606fe784cd2046002a583fa2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1337042,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sébastien de Sainte Croix","original_name":"Sébastien de Sainte Croix","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6071d5644d0e8d007b001c87","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3046504,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Karine Aulnette","original_name":"Karine Aulnette","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6071d58e839d930056939150","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":139385,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raja Amari","original_name":"Raja Amari","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/dB9T70B24Ul4X5mr5EV5LBP6ge5.jpg","credit_id":"6071d5d54b9bae006ef2a5de","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14076048","wikidata_id":"Q111173340","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1131,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/pYsZEVashEHpgdvXQFYz6hzFt6W.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1191,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/e8qqQoIvDM8F5KdrHWCp0csksqs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":794}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"One World Online","release_date":"2021-05-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
