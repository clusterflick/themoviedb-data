To Harrington’s amazement, and in spite of her lapsed religious beliefs, she must admit that her life has been transformed by the event. And when the press gets a hold of the story what ensues is a funny and touching look at what it means to believe and to belong.","popularity":0.0627,"poster_path":"/nDRVJjKEKKcBqNytOWRmjEXf0j3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Blinking Madonna and Other Miracles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288836,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beth Harrington","original_name":"Beth Harrington","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6070c90d2dda890040323480","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1288836,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beth Harrington","original_name":"Beth Harrington","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6070c9217776f000297bb1f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0115706","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":1900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nDRVJjKEKKcBqNytOWRmjEXf0j3.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1350},{"aspect_ratio":0.721,"height":1900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jUABH91I42Df0PpT3zHZGZbirw.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1370}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
