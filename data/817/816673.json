Thus, Lily van den Berg got a unique opportunity to observe their acquaintance with Western society and decided to capture it on film. No one suspected that in a year Olga would lose her life in this city. On July 26, 1992, on the third anniversary of her husband's death, Olga's body was found in a canal in Amsterdam. Her sudden death forced the director to look at the footage in reverse perspective.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inverted Perspective","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Обратная перспектива","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3045207,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lili van den Berg","original_name":"Lili van den Berg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60707867924ce50029b3a5cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
