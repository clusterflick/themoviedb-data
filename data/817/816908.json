Over the years of consultations, Andrey identified three main feelings of patients: confusion, fear, and apathy. And he believes that the doctors themselves are to blame for the fact that patients are afraid and do not understand what is happening. Together with the project\" Such things\", Andrey begins an experiment. From that moment on, the illness, the changes in his life, the memories, the everyday thoughts become public. Viewers and listeners will learn about the obstacles faced by a person who knows everything about cancer himself. It is not customary to speak publicly about such problems of oncology as training specialists or paternalistic relations between doctors and patients, but Andrey is ready for this, because he believes that the main weapon in the fight against cancer is information.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Human Life: Good News","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2043604,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristina Kuzhakhmetova","original_name":"Кристина Кужахметова","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/62myz2Vz3R7rjfIpj28sQ7FtXci.jpg","credit_id":"60719d6ed4b9d90040d5f976","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
