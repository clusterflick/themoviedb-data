She has just moved to Tórshavn and is seeing Trygvi, a hip-hop artist and poet locally known as Silvurdrongur (Silver Kid). He comes from a secular family and writes poems and texts about the shadow sides of humanity. Dania herself sings in a Christian band but is fascinated by Trygvi’s courage to write brutally honest lyrics. As she tries to find her place in the world and understand herself, she starts to write more personal texts. Her writings develop into a collection of critical poems called ‘Skál’ (‘Cheers’), about the double life that she and other youths must live in the conservative Christian world.","popularity":0.2953,"poster_path":"/nmZEAUxdSYYcSyjFQTRWdGknbyn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16439,"logo_path":"/saXOIbS0x4LxBUHQZvuKuoV4tAk.png","name":"Made in Copenhagen","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":168213,"logo_path":null,"name":"KYK Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":119,"logo_path":"/1di2gITGUZr730AMuMKiCrP90Vl.png","name":"DR","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":168217,"logo_path":"/nU6DF3Id1SoZpURX0E8rNmxZbcM.png","name":"Kykmyndir","origin_country":"FO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"FO","name":"Faeroe Islands"}],"release_date":"2021-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Faroese","iso_639_1":"fo","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Skál","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Skål","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3389674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dania O.
