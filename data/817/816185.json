But at heart, it is the story of one man’s daring stand against the tide of contemporary atheism and its drive to relegate belief in God to society’s catalogue of dead ideas.  Join the conversation between Dr. John Lennox—esteemed Oxford professor, mathematician, and philosopher of science—and veteran Hollywood actor and director Kevin Sorbo as they journey from Oxford to Jerusalem and explore the evidence on which Lennox’s Christian faith stands firm.","popularity":0.8463,"poster_path":"/u3r21Fx4KUT2BGpL8fXM3yO3Lp3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":222113,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pensmore Films","origin_country":""},{"id":222114,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kharis Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":222115,"logo_path":null,"name":"Capstone Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Against the Tide: Finding God in an Age of Science","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":132862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Lennox","original_name":"John Lennox","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/alMn6WMUvl3TIsPNU7lJE9N9h44.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"606eb73fe93e9500557c1e0e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51965,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Sorbo","original_name":"Kevin Sorbo","popularity":1.4535,"profile_path":"/a6rDi3tkNJwaVoP7VGbdGelwtYw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"606eb7490816c7002a7456a1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4564497,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ralf W.
