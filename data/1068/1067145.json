Born of Polish and Czech origins in what is now Slovakia, he soon showed solidarity with his new fellow citizens, due to the political troubles. A chemist by profession, he invented over 80 patents in various fields: from a hot water bottle, a precursor of the vacuum flask and a rotating toothbrush to medicines, detergents, insecticides, a brake system, the first anode battery, a compound for gramophone records and a fountain pen. 45 years before Sir Christopher Cockerell and his hovercraft, he came up with a craft that floated on air, and the principles of the helicopter. Croats were indebted to him for his patriotism, his invention and his construction of the first domestic aircraft, only a few years after the Wright brothers, as well as his role in the industrial development of the country in the early 20th century.","popularity":0.1233,"poster_path":"/5JKVd1er4aEo63wDnB6NNg7zYgS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Penkala","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3849571,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Milka Barišić","original_name":"Milka Barišić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ad6ede5ad76b007dc67769","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1936346,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dragan Ruljančić","original_name":"Dragan Ruljančić","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ad6f19c56d2d00d841ac89","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3849473,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mladen Radaković","original_name":"Mladen Radaković","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ad6f271f748b0082371025","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3849571,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Milka Barišić","original_name":"Milka Barišić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ad6f0a5ad76b0094c6d919","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1911392,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dalibor Grubačević","original_name":"Dalibor Grubačević","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/5Rz1V3yglrWBsPsjZf3zbPtDbvr.jpg","credit_id":"67b5ccb23751180bfcdfd882","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2605656","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5JKVd1er4aEo63wDnB6NNg7zYgS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
