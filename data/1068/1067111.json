We follow the exact route depicted in his book, Il millione, documenting the peoples, customs and cultures along the way to bring into sharp relief the cultural differences within the Asian mainland. Viewers are introduced to their development, becoming familiar with three completely different and, to us, relatively unknown spheres of civilisation and religion - Arabic Islam, Indian Hinduism and Oriental Buddhism. The host takes us through regions and cultures that may seem exotic - and, at times,dreamlike - in our search for the evidence of Marco Polo's passage.","popularity":0.188,"poster_path":"/drd37VcJ3VNFgY3xmOhbJjYLW61.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20915,"logo_path":"/g0ZgDi0m0RubOnoUFYaHsa8M5To.png","name":"Hrvatska Radiotelevizija","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2013-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"#marcopolo","title":"In Search of Marco Polo","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3849459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miro Branković","original_name":"Miro Branković","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Host","credit_id":"63ad53fa57530e00850039aa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3849460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Anđus","original_name":"Mario Anđus","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"63ad54361f748b00a0f16529","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1434741,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franjo Kuhar","original_name":"Franjo Kuhar","popularity":0.0823,"profile_path":"/h1z9Ex0ykn6qdRyTA9Vpc4R0AHo.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Voice of Marco Polo","credit_id":"63ad54557ef3811fde340407","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3849459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miro Branković","original_name":"Miro Branković","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6573acd2a84a47011b5f715a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3849463,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Siniša Tvorić","original_name":"Siniša Tvorić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ad54f457530e00a357f563","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1936346,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dragan Ruljančić","original_name":"Dragan Ruljančić","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ad5482be4b3600b63aea76","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3849462,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Boris Harmić","original_name":"Boris Harmić","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ad54d5c56d2d00a9811fef","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3849461,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Zdravko Borko","original_name":"Zdravko Borko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ad549d1f748b00c8b726e5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3849459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miro Branković","original_name":"Miro Branković","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ad54671f748b008a51a297","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1911392,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dalibor Grubačević","original_name":"Dalibor Grubačević","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/5Rz1V3yglrWBsPsjZf3zbPtDbvr.jpg","credit_id":"67b5cb13902f5e20a688bcb2","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2646050","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/drd37VcJ3VNFgY3xmOhbJjYLW61.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":853}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":173308,"name":"marco polo"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hr","note":"","release_date":"2013-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
