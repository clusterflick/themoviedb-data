The young peasant beyond her beauty is a humble woman who doesn't rely on her beauty alone but her strength of character, her education and on true love.  The poor farmer's daughter veils her face, but that doesn't prevent Arthur, the Prince of the kingdom from recognizing her true inner beauty and falling deeply in love with her.  The King cannot accept such a union. Her parent's farmhouse is burned. To save her life, she decides to change her identity by disguising herself as a valet and will henceforth be called Misfortune.  “As Pretty as Seven was once my name, But it changed to Misfortune when here I came.”.","popularity":0.5496,"poster_path":"/vxf0BHvbBn6Obc9GvW0VxhivEaF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Siebenschön","video":false,"vote_average":3.167,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Sechs auf einen Streich - Siebenschön","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Les Contes de Grimm ː La fille déguisée en garçon","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":576094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xenia Assenza","original_name":"Xenia Assenza","popularity":0.2542,"profile_path":"/zU8DxV1sxujBqNfMikH32h9bTkL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Siebenschön","credit_id":"63ad60835ad76b0094c6d3ad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz Dinda","original_name":"Franz Dinda","popularity":0.1289,"profile_path":"/oUEAVFkXWCYTCnWMxyuLo0zlEzs.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Prince Arthur","credit_id":"63ad60901f748b007da0d544","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Kind","original_name":"Michael Kind","popularity":0.5302,"profile_path":"/pGP1CV07GBO117n0aMFpeU8zO6S.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"King Richard","credit_id":"63ad609ebe4b3600b63aef47","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gustav Peter Wöhler","original_name":"Gustav Peter Wöhler","popularity":0.3625,"profile_path":"/jI1FZbiU4UYZ0Sn268cm0kIZgf0.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"King Johann","credit_id":"63ad60a75ad76b00cf412666","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florian Panzner","original_name":"Florian Panzner","popularity":0.4292,"profile_path":"/6hltmMrlXbAvcIgtirg1VNqnmzJ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Baron von und zu Wildungen","credit_id":"63ad60b15ad76b00e6f79c60","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1404576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Meier","original_name":"Barbara Meier","popularity":0.1497,"profile_path":"/kFiQad1dOVkzHXgx9PLMhf3f9Hw.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Bauernmädchen","credit_id":"63ad60ba5ad76b0094c6d3c0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":23120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teresa Weißbach","original_name":"Teresa Weißbach","popularity":0.1338,"profile_path":"/xO8CSIMgI4orvl00PSEBXVyHb4h.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Princess Zilly","credit_id":"63ad60c31f748b00a0f16ad1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":45820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esther Schweins","original_name":"Esther Schweins","popularity":0.5231,"profile_path":"/mZNgGt77c7H3tXDfgl4rkd38edx.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Genoveva","credit_id":"63ad60cc57530e0085003f36","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49798,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carsten Fiebeler","original_name":"Carsten Fiebeler","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ad60d95ad76b00cf412679","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2900015,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ludwig Bechstein","original_name":"Ludwig Bechstein","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ad60e61f748b007da0d568","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1290494,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anja Kömmerling","original_name":"Anja Kömmerling","popularity":0.0729,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ad60f07ef3811f6c1555d2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1290493,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Thomas Brinx","original_name":"Thomas Brinx","popularity":0.1016,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ad60fb1f748b00a0f16ae6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4305972","wikidata_id":"Q19309105","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1564,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mR6Pb4P68eLnGA8DaCNmUv2SMT4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2780}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vxf0BHvbBn6Obc9GvW0VxhivEaF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":846}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3205,"name":"fairy tale"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
