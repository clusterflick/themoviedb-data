After a 1961 series of concerts featuring Roscoe Holcomb, Clarence Ashley and Doc Watson, Alan Lomax invited the artists and a whoâ€™s who of the folk revival back to his West 3rd Avenue apartment for an impromptu song swap. Filming was arranged on the fly and a raw, many-layered evocation of the art and attitude of the period emerges from the footage, with some of the biggest names of the era, old timers and revivalists alike: Memphis Slim, Willie Dixon, Jean Ritchie, Ernie Marrs, Peter LeFarge, Ramblin Jack Elliott, Guy Carawan,the Greenbriar Boys, and the New Lost City Ramblers.","popularity":0.072,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ballads, Blues & Bluegrass","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545532,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Lomax","original_name":"Alan Lomax","popularity":0.0728,"profile_path":"/cl0OKLtG2KwIPPHwMekmUz88HDy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63aed6f35ad76b00e6f8258b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1124027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Memphis Slim","original_name":"Memphis Slim","popularity":0.0942,"profile_path":"/6i0wRASATS2mEmKLTTB2dHKdgPC.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63aed6fa57530e00c4814a0b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willie Dixon","original_name":"Willie Dixon","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63aed702c56d2d0089b10772","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1794616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Ritchie","original_name":"Jean Ritchie","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":"/9TifePnZ6FQEW6FKN3cr6HPdiI.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63aed70e57530e008013b583","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":186018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Elliott","original_name":"Jack Elliott","popularity":0.1079,"profile_path":"/qPmPFHqRQeO6sKHi4QIEn6hKE48.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63aed7977ef3811f6085e683","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545532,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Lomax","original_name":"Alan Lomax","popularity":0.0728,"profile_path":"/cl0OKLtG2KwIPPHwMekmUz88HDy.jpg","credit_id":"63aed6937ef3811f6085e60a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1670403,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"George Pickow","original_name":"George Pickow","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63aed69a5ad76b00e6f82566","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3850853,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anna Lomax Wood","original_name":"Anna Lomax Wood","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63aed6e0c56d2d00f30e82aa","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1794616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Ritchie","original_name":"Jean Ritchie","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":"/9TifePnZ6FQEW6FKN3cr6HPdiI.jpg","credit_id":"63aed71f5ad76b00cf41a626","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545532,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Lomax","original_name":"Alan Lomax","popularity":0.0728,"profile_path":"/cl0OKLtG2KwIPPHwMekmUz88HDy.jpg","credit_id":"63aed748be4b3600d73f7f4f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1670403,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"George Pickow","original_name":"George Pickow","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63aed7505ad76b007dc6f37f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1794616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Ritchie","original_name":"Jean Ritchie","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":"/9TifePnZ6FQEW6FKN3cr6HPdiI.jpg","credit_id":"63aed75857530e008dca2b40","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
