Still it is not. The village comes to life back with past voices. There is no people in the village. But their voices exist. There are no animals and no living things. But their voices exist. The past voices, together with scenes happenning right now, create memory about what happened there. It is the story of people, animals, nature and all the living things of a village before it is ruined.","popularity":0.1451,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Homeland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3849724,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nazif Coskun","original_name":"Nazif Coskun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ada66b7ef3811fab63bd8a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21228454","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":229952,"name":"kurd"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":297504,"name":"landscape film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ku","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
