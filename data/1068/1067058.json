[EP1] Onari (Tatsuya Tanaka), who makes a living by posting psychic videos, went to Moanmu Village in the name of a parade of psychic attractions. There, the enshrined \"person\" was stolen from the shrine guarding the village. No one has seen him since that day. [EP2] At the same time, the psychic master Minagawa (Miura Kiyomitsu) in Tokyo also began to chain the curse on the village of Moanmu he had visited. One day, someone sent a \"person\" from Minagawa. His ability is unmatched. [EP3] Dark traveler Mifuyu (Kanako Seta) interviewed the place where a certain incident in Yamanashi happened alone. Soon lost in the forest. Then she saw something she must never see. Didn't know there was Moanmu Village.... The fate of the three people who had nothing to do with each other arrived at that village.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/qN08Kn7Wbh1iudq28vRE9h4vMbS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97940,"logo_path":"/kOF6C4l0WZNqRjUjfgKKegx3sA3.png","name":"BBB","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2022-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"富士五湖奇譚 呻母村","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":3731036,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kenji Mochizuki","original_name":"Kenji Mochizuki","popularity":0.001,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6429c7750f36550076536167","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":3731036,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kenji Mochizuki","original_name":"Kenji Mochizuki","popularity":0.001,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644fbaebc0a30802dd70e2f0","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qN08Kn7Wbh1iudq28vRE9h4vMbS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
