He and Princess Ella love each other and want to get married and discover the world together. But Ella's father King Wilbur does not accept it. He traps Gaspard in a dungeon and makes his daughter believe that he has gone around the world.  In prison, Gaspard meets Lucas \"The Strong\", who is stronger than 10 men, and Flora \"The Witch\", who orders plants. Thanks to Lucas, they escape from prison, and on their way they meet Marcus \"The Runner\", who carries an anvil in his bag to prevent himself from running faster than the wind; Benjamin \"The Marksman\", who has a view that carries further than that of an eagle; and Lisa \"The Icy\", who has a breath of ice.","popularity":0.4618,"poster_path":"/uqQX6QcYbR5DQSwVmzJRFRR1nHG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sechse kommen durch die ganze Welt","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Sechs auf einen Streich - Sechse kommen durch die ganze Welt","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Les Contes de Grimm ː Les six compagnons qui viennent à bout de tout","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sebastian Bezzel","original_name":"Sebastian Bezzel","popularity":0.3729,"profile_path":"/tsH7sdL0m5ILypke3OzQFtbTydE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"King Wilbur","credit_id":"63ad61e2be4b36008a6cc45f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rafael Gareisen","original_name":"Rafael Gareisen","popularity":0.1822,"profile_path":"/8BBApYITilcBvE7XQKPnQdPCh55.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jasper","credit_id":"63ad61ea7ef3811f60856794","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1401494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Maria Heid","original_name":"Laura Maria Heid","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":"/ysg1KThlRotYbOD2FVoplZ7ytC.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Princess Ella","credit_id":"63ad61f3c56d2d007c829398","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":135075,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tonio Arango","original_name":"Tonio Arango","popularity":0.2682,"profile_path":"/wDgtv0UoQifjDaegO9t7WdDcXPL.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Chancellor","credit_id":"63ad61fcbe4b3600b63aefbb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1412182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maximilian Gehrlinger","original_name":"Maximilian Gehrlinger","popularity":0.1008,"profile_path":"/7tgxTS29b5BwTmB9DvYUumPEyv2.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Markus","credit_id":"63ad620457530e0085003f99","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":207812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emil Reinke","original_name":"Emil Reinke","popularity":0.3184,"profile_path":"/hXdmylxaOMFnu0ZZ3NL8lFOWVtf.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Benjamin","credit_id":"63ad620b5ad76b00e6f79ce5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1158344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mercedes Müller","original_name":"Mercedes Müller","popularity":0.4478,"profile_path":"/aDC4fl4b5mHsg51wuKaYNPoxBY5.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Lisa","credit_id":"63ad62157ef3811f58c9a0b3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1324548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anton Rubtsov","original_name":"Anton Rubtsov","popularity":0.4965,"profile_path":"/eKWjFP7wAr9ndIbAnUdAXj0UXJz.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Lukas","credit_id":"63ad62221f748b00823709a6","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1155563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alissa Wilms","original_name":"Alissa Wilms","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Flora","credit_id":"63ad622d7ef3811fab63a791","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1412183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Kuske","original_name":"Kevin Kuske","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":"/fo48qH5WbharLe0MBynHcZGGCV8.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Theodor","credit_id":"63ad62355ad76b007dc671e8","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":48401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rüdiger Kühmstedt","original_name":"Rüdiger Kühmstedt","popularity":0.0456,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"63ad623cbe4b36008281e9b4","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928706,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Ungureit","original_name":"David Ungureit","popularity":0.1083,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ad62555ad76b00ae8f7046","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":221508,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Uwe Janson","original_name":"Uwe Janson","popularity":0.0686,"profile_path":"/aKB2vCxb7SquxfwAOQpN0eAh6qU.jpg","credit_id":"63ad62491f748b007da0d5c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4306002","wikidata_id":"Q18630663","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8sl0MoV3BWkxQKfaWC1HYvDgjn1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uqQX6QcYbR5DQSwVmzJRFRR1nHG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":846}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3205,"name":"fairy tale"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
