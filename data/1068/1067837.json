While penning his next book in an isolated chalet, he receives a strange visit from Jota, a somewhat troubling character, who claims to be a journalist. No one is aware of Leo’s true identity and only Victoria, his agent, knows his whereabouts, so... How has Jota managed to track him down? What are his intentions?
