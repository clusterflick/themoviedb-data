It receives more than 6 million tourists a year and has a population of 930000 inhabitants. These figures are born from the terrible way in which the island has been managed during the last decades and currently. An infinite and untenable growth which is threatening more than ever the natural spaces and biodiversity from Tenerife, more and more deteriorated each day. This documentary seeks to boost a change towards real sustainable development, so we can have a future in which we live alongside nature and we can keep enjoying Tenerife (and the rest of the Canary Islands) in their wild and natural state.","popularity":0.1063,"poster_path":"/23XxP7qVuP1EOdiDKewxfqbIXxU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":189361,"logo_path":null,"name":"Especies de Canarias","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Salvar Tenerife","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3851045,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Felipe Ravina","original_name":"Felipe Ravina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63af112fc56d2d0096d3454e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3851045,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Felipe Ravina","original_name":"Felipe Ravina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63af11a57ef3811f6c15f18f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3851045,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Felipe Ravina","original_name":"Felipe Ravina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63af114a7ef3811f58ca393b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"@salvartenerife","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/23XxP7qVuP1EOdiDKewxfqbIXxU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18330,"name":"nature"},{"id":223524,"name":"canary islands"},{"id":283805,"name":"biodiversidad"},{"id":323691,"name":"sobreexplotación"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
