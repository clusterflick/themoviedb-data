Marty talks about his kids, football, taking it like a man, looking for lost dogs, spelling bees, roller coasters and \"the code\". Everything he says is a true story based on something that either happened to him, his kids, or that he made up entirely. He also talks about the chief purpose of man and being Christ-like.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/p6F9fUgzGFo3uRDiVYHilMJ5tpM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clean If It Kills Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3849189,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marty Simpson","original_name":"Marty Simpson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/n8KWQVXQCtDnPKVjrs0mzQNtuMd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"himself","credit_id":"63acfe835ad76b0085e4f51c","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p6F9fUgzGFo3uRDiVYHilMJ5tpM.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.719,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oq3MnEYLOscQbc0axZ1wXkbPi7l.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":575}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
