Particularly pictures of women.”  In this unique and intimate interview, Collier Schorr takes us through her life and career – from an early childhood room turned into a female utopia until today, where she recognizes herself in the ancient myth of Medusa.  “The importance of images today and the idea of there being so many, let’s say, in social media and Instagram, and why make another one and how does your picture exist in this sea of pictures is so interesting because you decide at some point that your pictures are the best. And for me, what that means, is that my pictures are intimate, inclusive, anti-harm, and anti-violent.”","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Collier Schorr: Medusa is Never Far","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
