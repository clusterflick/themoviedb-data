What does that teach us about the mystical experience of oneness with nature? Based on these questions, psychiatrist Franz Vollenweider and Zen master Vanja Palmers set up a legal science experiment in a monastery at the top of Mount Rigi in Switzerland. Exactly 50 years after the magic mushrooms were officially banned, a new story begins in what is now called the “psychedelic renaissance”. While in 2021 most studies with psychedelics mainly focus on their promising medical applications, Frans and Vanja are already going a step further. Can the combination of meditation and psilocibin help humanity get out of the mess we have created on ourselves and the planet with our neo-liberal society?","popularity":0.1665,"poster_path":"/pyKr06A1dObz7IBHUjxWsYnaDyd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131167,"logo_path":null,"name":"MAGNETFILM GmbH","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2021-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Descending the Mountain","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3663772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vanja Palmers","original_name":"Vanja Palmers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"62f93d67e267de007b6fbc83","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3663774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz Vollenweider","original_name":"Franz Vollenweider","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"62f93d7c1dbc880084515021","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3663776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sister Theresia  Raberger","original_name":"Sister Theresia  Raberger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"62f93d8a6f53e10083f4d9c7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3663779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dr. Peter Gasser","original_name":"Dr. Peter Gasser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"62f93d991dbc880084515030","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3663780,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Annette Badenhorst","original_name":"Annette Badenhorst","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f93db4c04429009ab9c574","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3663781,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Monette de Botton","original_name":"Monette de Botton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f93dc4a313b8007cf4174c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3663782,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bohdana Tamas","original_name":"Bohdana Tamas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f93dd9326ec100821c8cd1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168194,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gys Zevenbergen","original_name":"Gys Zevenbergen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f93deb9a64350098798c06","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1705263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cosmo Sheldrake","original_name":"Cosmo Sheldrake","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/7UH0EVtPiW1Q20dhLZXvhM3cxE.jpg","credit_id":"62f93dfd7eb5f2007ea46a79","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1785888,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jean Counet","original_name":"Jean Counet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62f93e371750510084a37144","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1411433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maartje Nevejan","original_name":"Maartje Nevejan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61811efff6596f002a1b2a94","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt17061814","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4Qs3ifd0lEsKZGvtzeHRe7OxNAq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":1511,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hAvcNKOp1kZFzo1MnJoYzwI6SfY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pyKr06A1dObz7IBHUjxWsYnaDyd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":184392,"name":"psychedelic"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Descending the Mountain | Trailer","key":"4T8gDFITzVk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-11-10T13:36:06.000Z","id":"62f93ce2175051007f907c7f"}]}}}
