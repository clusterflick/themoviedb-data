Thousands of victims from drug trafficking in a country amongst the most dangerous in the world. Indigenous peoples struggling for dignity, Marxists against imperialism, pharmacies selling cigarettes, 50% of the population dying of starvation, the Zapatista Movement shuts itself off from the outside world, the left is fragmented, the jeopardized right governs. The mixture of vitality and atrocities mark a volatile and yet brewing social situation. Crossing Mexico becomes a political reflection in a sense, both historical and anthropological. Without stopping, the words and images of this film are woven into concepts and feelings, creating a continuous flow, a domino effect in the chain of the contemporary human condition.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/kR8kFBphxXrDnVtcZKk3ZgYQa53.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140688,"logo_path":null,"name":"NOMADICA","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El tiempo del no tiempo","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3060615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giulia Mazzone","original_name":"Giulia Mazzone","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61814818d236e6004344b2de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2703878,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giuseppe Spina","original_name":"Giuseppe Spina","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/A4Cr9zx36iR3lVV4XILvu7lrxoV.jpg","credit_id":"6181480b075288008d0717ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kR8kFBphxXrDnVtcZKk3ZgYQa53.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
