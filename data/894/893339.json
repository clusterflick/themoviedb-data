This work is a hybrid of filmed performance, CGI animation and sound art. It draws on Chinese myth and a sense of belonging from an Asian queer diasporic perspective.  ‘you must everywhere wander 你必顧盼’ is a meeting point of transgressive queer desire, a dream homeland and reality. We are what we eat, we are what we remember, we are what we believe.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/seYT2seC9MXvl4Hk6OM5bPzT3nv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"you must everywhere wander","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"你必顧盼","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3294526,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Whiskey Chow","original_name":"Whiskey Chow","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618180cc8ed03f0063697c82","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/seYT2seC9MXvl4Hk6OM5bPzT3nv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
