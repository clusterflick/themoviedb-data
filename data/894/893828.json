Bradley Hunt, the celebrated Heiltsuk artist on whose work the characters in Totem Talk are based.","popularity":0.1086,"poster_path":"/ocVhf3y8QnFiuhJNAGdG84x6jvf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1997-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Totem Talk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3295837,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morgan Rose","original_name":"Morgan Rose","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Teen","credit_id":"6182ef714a4bfc008d631be4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3295840,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Thomas","original_name":"David Thomas","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Teen","credit_id":"6182ef9ae741460043886ddc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3295842,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Sherwood","original_name":"Michael Sherwood","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Teen","credit_id":"6182efad0d417e002d8f88a0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3295843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stella Johnson","original_name":"Stella Johnson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Totem (voice)","credit_id":"6182efd0e54d5d0043ad1008","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2959939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Bob","original_name":"Sam Bob","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/paFvbgt734PNECTsRMivwmIPbHN.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Totem (voice)","credit_id":"6182eff9cb6db5002c2b1b57","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3295846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chief Henry Seaweed","original_name":"Chief Henry Seaweed","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"6182f00c8ed03f00636c33fc","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3295847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Taylor","original_name":"Jason Taylor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"6182f01e0d417e006984b8f0","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3295848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
