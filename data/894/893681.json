Figures and objects are isolated, linked together only by their presence on a beach, all exposed to direct or indirect threats. The different jellyfish are as much at threat – washing up dead, stranded in the desolate landscape – as they are a threat – appearing suddenly and making people vanish.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/yFnLybM1AjGLSzj6wqrv4t3JtCm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38052,"logo_path":"/8uZNsz3zVarlswxx3CDBtfLPgMT.png","name":"Amber Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1973-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Jellyfish","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1502548,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Roberts","original_name":"Peter Roberts","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6238b8dedb4ed600451d48af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d5yuXk08k4KsN3cKfmE90trQxwT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oIPrpICZC3xN3Tp7J0TSmeQSIao.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yFnLybM1AjGLSzj6wqrv4t3JtCm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
