What little evidence there is suggests it may be the work of the Chupacabra, a creature most believe to be little more than urban legend. According to folklore, Chupa kills small livestock, living off their blood. But why has it started preying on people? To answer that question, a small Federal, military, and civilian task force has been sent deep into Ohio’s expansive Cuyahoga Valley National Park to find and capture the mythical monster. But it won’t be taken without a fight, and as the hunters quickly become the hunted, they soon realize their “Chupa” may be something else altogether. Something that feeds in secret has started feeding... on them!","popularity":0.1134,"poster_path":"/ywcNaTjoUSrIXsg8jGOG8a917YF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":163778,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tempe Digital","origin_country":""},{"id":195456,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seeing Eye Cinema","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"THEY FEED IN SECRET...
