Like in a kaleidoscope relatives as well as friends and strangers pass the eye of the camera. Album 1 is a silent film shot in super 8 that is intended to be screened with live sound: a piano improvisation and several voices that read texts by William Burroughs, Henri Michaux and the filmmaker himself, all these things make this screening a unique event.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":"/c9hIsHs9yriFR1xGhhAzZd1Jaac.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Album 1","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1266093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boris Lehman","original_name":"Boris Lehman","popularity":0.1108,"profile_path":"/1CElhTCznn4EcV5rBJoPMixCoqA.jpg","credit_id":"61826a2f0752880063c56b5c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/c9hIsHs9yriFR1xGhhAzZd1Jaac.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
