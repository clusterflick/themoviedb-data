We begin in 1809 where we will meet Thomasina, a teenager and mathematical prodigy, who works with her tutor Septimus. Yet we learn there are many secrets within the family on the estate. Affairs of the heart, unrequited love, and debates about chaos theory and the ideal gardening landscape flow throughout these scenes in the past. When the story moves to 1992, a garden historian and a literature professor visit to unearth the past. Was Lord Byron actually a guest? Was there a duel? Why is there a hermitage on the estate? What do the the current inhabitants of Sibley Park know about the past? Scenes move fluidly between two centuries, with an increasing reminder to cherish our time together. Arcadia is a play about passion, longing, astrophysics, and both the strength and fragility of the human heart","popularity":0.2576,"poster_path":"/wo9unjoMLwle65Ghd8R1r6uImJ8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":163781,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shotgun Players","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arcadia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1218821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabrielle Christian","original_name":"Gabrielle Christian","popularity":0.2101,"profile_path":"/hXtsJt67cUFR7SFnwG1MzkBdDQc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Valentine Coverly","credit_id":"6183082ef6596f0088a7fea9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3296005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justin DuPuis","original_name":"Justin DuPuis","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Ezra Chater","credit_id":"6183083d13a3880096d1026c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2199660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessma Evans","original_name":"Jessma Evans","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Hannah Jarvis","credit_id":"61830853f6596f002a1e9d71","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3296009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Forman-Mullin","original_name":"Max Forman-Mullin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Septimus Hodge","credit_id":"618308aacb6db5008d5100f1","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3296010,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Patrick Dooley","original_name":"Patrick Dooley","popularity":0.0523,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618308e8d388ae006126d780","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3296011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Perry Fenton","original_name":"Perry Fenton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6183090ea097dc00922ce6cf","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2582133,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Cliff Caruthers","original_name":"Cliff Caruthers","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6183092c13a388002b0ffc44","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3296012,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Brooke Jennings","original_name":"Brooke Jennings","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61830947e54d5d0064c162f3","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":372,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tom Stoppard","original_name":"Tom Stoppard","popularity":0.264,"profile_path":"/mLkxQBDf3QRx8MhSremy35YcZoC.jpg","credit_id":"6648901c658beb2b0695b578","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":839,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6oFHh2fkZgCzQHhugAmKPomNvMx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1491}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wo9unjoMLwle65Ghd8R1r6uImJ8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
