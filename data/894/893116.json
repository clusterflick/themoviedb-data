Along the way they had to sub one sibling for another, with younger brother Jerry (\"Curly\") coming in to replace brother Shemp, who was on his way to a successful solo career in Vitaphone movies comedies. Ted Healy may have been the nominal headliner, but it's Howard, Fine and Howard's comedic antics that captivate across these frothy MGM musical comedy shorts that combine slapstick and show-stoppers, and even some snazzy two-strip Technicolor. Best of all, this collection contains the long-through-lost Stooge-sational short \"Hello Pop!\", which was recently rediscovered and restored! Collection includes Plane Nuts (1933); Roast Beef and Movies (1934, two-color Technicolor); Beer and Pretzels (1933); Nertsery Rhymes (1933, two-color Technicolor); Hello Pop! (1933, two-color Technicolor).","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Classic Shorts from the Dream Factory Volume 3","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
