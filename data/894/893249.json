We often translate it into “wonder”, but this is an improper definition. To assert, like Aristotle did, that every knowledge and every technique come from the wonder is not enough. For Homer, zauma is Polyphemus eating the Odysseus’ comrades, that is to say that it means something more strong and negative than “wonder”. Homeric poems evoke an eerie monstrosity. As it has provoked the whole knowledge and philosophy, zauma is generally intended to be the anguished terror in front of world’s becoming. (E.
