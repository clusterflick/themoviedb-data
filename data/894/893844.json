Inspired by the cautionary tale 'The Boy Who Cried Wolf', this hand-crafted animation gives humour and heart to a grim true story. The intention for this production was to create a film that accentuates the tactile nature of stop-motion animation technology to immerse the audience in the colourful narrative world. The intricate sets, dynamic lighting and complex sound design enrich the visual experience, and encourage audiences to reflect upon their own childhood stories.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2021-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Girl Who Cried Sick","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3295901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ruby Taylor","original_name":"Ruby Taylor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6182f737e93e9500625c0022","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3295901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ruby Taylor","original_name":"Ruby Taylor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6182f73e4a4bfc00658a2feb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Girl Who Cried Sick- Ruby Taylor","key":"jLm9gmP26jw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2021-02-02T21:26:10.000Z","id":"6182f72ca097dc00428bc437"}]}}}
