Time passed. Different political winds blew in the country, slogans and portraits of leaders changed at mass celebrations, sculptures on alleys changed ... Gradually it turned from a \"factory of happiness\" into a banal \"place of leisure\", and by the beginning of the XXI century it finally became dilapidated. Today, the old park is actively changing, being reconstructed, trying to adapt to the needs and demands of the new time. At the same time, it is important not to forget that the CPKiO was the product and evidence of a terrible, but very significant era. And to erase her traces does not mean to get rid of her complexes at all","popularity":0.0579,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Alleys of the Central Park","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2092177,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boris Karadzhev","original_name":"Борис Караджев","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/dlFlQrYjBuVY7aBOPAnqh4pTPTN.jpg","credit_id":"623aec0a58361b004aa13bc9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
