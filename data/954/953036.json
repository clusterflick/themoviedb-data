And he does so with his poetic and visionary style, interweaving other images with the filming of the play, sequences shot specifically in the slum to carry out the alchemical operation of transforming theatre into cinema. Around them a chorus swarming with bodies recites the tumult of being both beasts and damned, thieves and murderers, devils and corrupt politicians and poets who indicate the ways of salvation: between songs and acting, frenetic races and wild dances, the 150 protagonists give life to a fresco full of moving poetry, further confirmation of the universality of Dante's masterpiece.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/rrfgVhe4FdRkmF2XR9yh2tB04e2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The sky over Kibera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3071348,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Martinelli","original_name":"Marco Martinelli","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623aefcc719aeb00915501ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3071348,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Martinelli","original_name":"Marco Martinelli","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623aefd26bdec300477ad08f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1946844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ermanna Montanari","original_name":"Ermanna Montanari","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/6s9ELz67URqLaIe8Ba4z1fXtkWN.jpg","credit_id":"669ed7961819b19f3647a967","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3071348,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Martinelli","original_name":"Marco Martinelli","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669ed7a20cdc8e4842d176a0","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4844306,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniele Roccato","original_name":"Daniele Roccato","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669ed7c1efa9caf41859198f","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4844309,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Rosalba Ruggeri","original_name":"Rosalba Ruggeri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669ed8118e958f2a33e5316f","department":"Crew","job":"Public Relations"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4844305,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Riccardo Bonacina","original_name":"Riccardo Bonacina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669ed7b5c14f29b235a6ef29","department":"Writing","job":"Script Consultant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3808660,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alessandro Cappello","original_name":"Alessandro Cappello","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669ed7f34e58612bc24c59a8","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4844307,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Redaelli","original_name":"Laura Redaelli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669ed7ce67930317dff37875","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1500533,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Francesco Tedde","original_name":"Francesco Tedde","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669ed7d8560a7e68d44becfa","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18358142","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rCMBUF9QYMX3pfxNKD82PWcK4cD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/rrfgVhe4FdRkmF2XR9yh2tB04e2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Filmmaker Festival","release_date":"2019-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
