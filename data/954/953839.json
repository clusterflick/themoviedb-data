A biography is a less significant thing. Most readers of Don Quixote do not know the biography of Cervantes and do not particularly need it. But sometimes the biography of a writer can become an explanation for the incident of a genius who turned out to be unnecessary or unidentified, unrecognized. This is precisely the case of Friedrich Gorenstein, the author of Andrey Rublev's monologues in Tarkovsky's film and the screenwriter of his own \"Solaris\", the author of the dialogues in Konchalovsky's film \"The First Teacher\" and co-author with him of the script for the film \"Slave of Love\"","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Place of Gorenstein","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3463730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yury Veksler","original_name":"Yury Veksler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623cc05ba1c59d005dd33af6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
