Atmosphere and moods are induced by watercolour designs, mostly washes, suggesting landscapes through which faces and figures appear. The effect is dreamlike, an ebb and flow of colour, form and line, to the accompaniment of music. The animation is largely of textures rather than of design, washes of colour that come and go to the bidding of the music or the whim of the artist.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/inXZSXlN61eiVZVc29xgwPRyrDs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1974-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Climates","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Climats","type":"French"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1335896,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suzanne Gervais","original_name":"Suzanne Gervais","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623c9ab7a1c59d005dd2ab93","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0228147","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/inXZSXlN61eiVZVc29xgwPRyrDs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
