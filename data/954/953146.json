On one of her excursions, she befriends a cantankerous old millionaire, George Bassett, who later bequeaths to her his entire estate. Ralph Long's car plunges down an embankment, and he is dragged from the wreckage and looked after by the Weed, who soon captivates him with her charm and ingenuousness. While he is in the hospital, however, the lecherous Kenneth Stewart snaps a photo of the girl swimming in the nude in a mountain pool and hangs an enlargement of it in his club.","popularity":0.1004,"poster_path":"/2mJpNY1pFNjqfJOFhtZxKVG4G5B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":41056,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Film Corporation of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Far-famed screen comedienne makes her debut in picture drama in a happy story of how a mountain waif found love, riches and a husband by being her joyful self.","title":"The Girl of My Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1157064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billie Rhodes","original_name":"Billie Rhodes","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/8oXEkqwiT8FsWfgdyPW57zM3tN9.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Weed","credit_id":"623b29eb719aeb00486b2afa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1042599,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack McDonald","original_name":"Jack McDonald","popularity":0.1628,"profile_path":"/ugI4hSBdSZk7m7H8ij60dDWVW2K.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"George Bassett","credit_id":"623b29fe6bdec3005b4539ee","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1689725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lamar Johnstone","original_name":"Lamar Johnstone","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/bemomrIJwU6rvbBQDsWhIAHz4P3.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Kenneth Stewart","credit_id":"623b2a0ee942be00877f7e36","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2317724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Golda Madden","original_name":"Golda Madden","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Madelin Stewart","credit_id":"623b2a225541fa00925fcf41","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":121293,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Keckley","original_name":"Jane Keckley","popularity":0.0731,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Ma Williams","credit_id":"623b2a3a58361b0095b61995","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1795626,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank MacQuarrie","original_name":"Frank MacQuarrie","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Pa Williams","credit_id":"623b2a50719aeb00486b2c16","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2123485,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Suslow","original_name":"Ben Suslow","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Jed Williams","credit_id":"623b2a62d7dcd2008bc70cde","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1274885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Pierson","original_name":"Leo Pierson","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/qma5dVgDWItCqfhWXEWYjvAC5yM.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Ralph Long","credit_id":"623b2a74a34911005dc3250a","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157060,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Otto A.
