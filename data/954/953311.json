An intentionally crude cartoon with a live action epilogue in which Milius appears with Gayle Hunnicutt. The film was made when Milius was a student at the University of Southern California and was a parody of Italian cinema. The film was edited by George Lucas. Milius' first film is important because it was the beginning point for his contribution of a style emphasizing depth and meaning in American popular films.","popularity":0.3902,"poster_path":"/9VxkwOeT6A8Je6Hm9oAJAA8eOxi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marcello, I'm Bored","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8328,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Milius","original_name":"John Milius","popularity":0.6831,"profile_path":"/5e9PS8MtgEqpSAeqgUp7gaVU0gU.jpg","credit_id":"623b9134a1c59d004947391e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1937509,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Strawbridge","original_name":"John Strawbridge","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623b92165541fa00494d7d61","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Lucas","original_name":"George Lucas","popularity":2.1174,"profile_path":"/mDLDvsx8PaZoEThkBdyaG1JxPdf.jpg","credit_id":"623b924a93bd690049bb8142","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0249785","wikidata_id":"Q20649597","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9VxkwOeT6A8Je6Hm9oAJAA8eOxi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
