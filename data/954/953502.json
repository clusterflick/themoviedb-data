But this film is not about the most famous political prisoner. This is the reaction of the population of our country to the arrest of Khodorkovsky, recorded conversations on the streets of different cities with the first passers-by. The people's ruthlessness, the desire for blood, the joyful readiness to execute lynching themselves, saving the fatherland, over all who are smarter, richer, freer, over Jews and people of a different mentality – this is a frighteningly objective assessment of us, residents of sovereign Russia, a country whose future may never come.","popularity":0.0314,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reaction","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3475857,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir Gerchikov","original_name":"Vladimir Gerchikov","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/6O8468LGtg95dxYBTCYd68OlY44.jpg","credit_id":"623c299e6bdec3005b48b894","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
