(An example: “A house of steel / Among high mountains / Using candles / Inhabited by people who sleep almost all the time.”) This significant, jam-packed exhibition revives Knowles’s poem on an old-school dot-matrix printer, and includes related ephemera, including a film by Allan Kaprow. The show also highlights forebears of Knowles’s aleatory composition, with a never-completed book by Mallarmé whose pages could be reordered at will, as well as Marcel Broodthaer’s 1969 homage to it. There are also successors: Nicholas Knight’s intricate paintings of overlapping colored curves were generated by an algorithm, and Katarzyna Krakowiak’s audio piece remixes Knowles’s original poem into skittering musique concrète.","popularity":0.2517,"poster_path":"/ld0CMbalWMk7vvlIwj7ytZebjV9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172214,"logo_path":null,"name":"Emily Harvey Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The House of Dust","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3159356,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alison Knowles","original_name":"Alison Knowles","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"623cc37bd7dcd200492feaad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1324173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessica Higgins","original_name":"Jessica Higgins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"623cc3a16f43ec005c9ddee5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3478644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joshua Selman","original_name":"Joshua Selman","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"623cc3cf5541fa005d38ea4a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3478645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clara Joy","original_name":"Clara Joy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"623cc3e1efca000047acc8e3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3478646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Hubert","original_name":"Andrew Hubert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"623cc3f8a34911005dc956b7","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3159356,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alison Knowles","original_name":"Alison Knowles","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623cc415a1c59d00494af1b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3478644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joshua Selman","original_name":"Joshua Selman","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623cc485211ce500478aff6c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143921,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jeffrey Perkins","original_name":"Jeffrey Perkins","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623cc469a34911005dc95959","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3478644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joshua Selman","original_name":"Joshua Selman","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623cc48fefca000047accbb2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1324173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessica Higgins","original_name":"Jessica Higgins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623cc4274fd1410049fbb3aa","department":"Art","job":"Creative Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3478644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joshua Selman","original_name":"Joshua Selman","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623cc47dd1a89300479952be","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ld0CMbalWMk7vvlIwj7ytZebjV9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1365}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10583,"name":"performance art"},{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"},{"id":171438,"name":"poetry recitation"},{"id":199685,"name":"live play"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"ALISON KNOWLES: THE HOUSE OF DUST (1967 / 2021)","key":"foYCInyzsow","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2021-07-25T15:46:29.000Z","id":"623cc528a31440005d79f2ec"}]}}}
