What happens? He doesn't have time to understand that the scenery changes again: Stefano is now on the stage set up together with Colin Firth, in stage clothes, to recite the beginning of the opera. Until the spell is broken: we are back to the present, Stefano is in the animated theater of people. He smiles. Whatever happened, the theater is alive, stronger than any closure.","popularity":0.4477,"poster_path":"/94mGQhjJWkwV3l6XphcESbJbDOf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chiusi
