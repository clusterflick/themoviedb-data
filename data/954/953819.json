The idea to build a monument on Bunardzhik Hill in honor of Soviet soldiers-liberators was born among the residents of Plovdiv back in 1948. The initiative came entirely from \"below\", from the people, without any recommendation from \"above\". On May 9, 1948, the Citywide Initiative Committee for the construction of a monument to Soviet soldiers was established, which included public figures, architects, artists, writers and teachers. It was headed by the head of the Plovdiv military garrison, General Asen Grekov. On the same day, the symbolic laying of the base of the monument was made.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alyosha","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2327199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikhail Degtyar","original_name":"Mikhail Degtyar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623cb90f6f43ec005c9db7af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
