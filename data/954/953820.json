Most of them were Jews. The Soviet authorities did not want to bury these people. Even the obelisk at the place of execution was put up after the war with the money of the relatives of the victims... In July 1994, Mikhail Degtyar came to this firing pit and saw a terrible picture - skulls, bones, documents of people shot 53 years ago were scattered very close to the Yalta International Hotel. 9 years later, Mikhail Degtyar returned to the place of execution of Yalta Jews. What has changed during this time? This is the movie \"Execution\".","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Firing Squad","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2327199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikhail Degtyar","original_name":"Mikhail Degtyar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623cb964a1c59d00494ac94a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
