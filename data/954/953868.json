A former thief and murderer, today he is a hospitable host and an exemplary family man. The sea became for Volodya not only a source of survival in post-war Abkhazia, but also a refuge from the bustle of the outside world. Children, animals, mountains, grapes, Abkhazia seems like an earthly paradise, but traces of shells on the walls and military helicopters in the sky constantly remind of its fragility.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sea in Bambor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3478669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilya Kosachev","original_name":"Ilya Kosachev","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623cc6a8a7e363005db9382b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
