The film explores the fourth state of matter, the plasma that fills the infinite void between stars and galaxies. Single atoms in space, or planets as large as the sun, are each seen to have their own magnetic fields, attracting to themselves streams of invisible particles just as iron filings are drawn to a magnet. This has the same awe-inspiring quality as the earlier Universe, with colour adding to its wonder and dimension.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/1rVLAm39KJBpn8fDbPBQherNXqT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1969-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fields of Space","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Champs de l'espace","type":"French"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1403988,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sidney Goldsmith","original_name":"Sidney Goldsmith","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623c8d114fd141005ecc974e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0280669","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1rVLAm39KJBpn8fDbPBQherNXqT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
