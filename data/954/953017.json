Perhaps one of the rare examples of this kind gives us a creative direction that has gone down in history under the name \"social art\", which is regarded in the West as the most significant contribution of Soviet fine art to the world artistic process of the second half of the twentieth century. In our film, the fate of this creative direction is reflected by its brightest representatives – Vitaly Komar, Alexander Kosolapov, Leonid Sokov, Boris Orlov, Rostislav Lebedev and Mikhail Roshal. Their collective story about the fate of \"social art\" unfolds against the background of the chronicle of the political and artistic life of the 70-90s.","popularity":0.0789,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All Our Life is Sots Art","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Вся наша жизнь – соц-арт!","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"ВСЯ НАША ЖИЗНЬ – СОЦ-АРТ","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2092177,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boris Karadzhev","original_name":"Борис Караджев","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/dlFlQrYjBuVY7aBOPAnqh4pTPTN.jpg","credit_id":"623ae640e942be00877f03be","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
