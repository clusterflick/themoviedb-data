Прощай, королева!","overview":"\"When I pray morning and evening, I always ask: I want to die first, and then finish singing!\" - this is how Elena Obraztsova said in her last interview. She gave it to our film crew on November 28, 2014. That evening there was a Big Ball at the Bolshoi Theater in honor of Elena Obraztsova's 75th birthday. And for the first time, the best voices of the world sounded on the same stage - Anna Netrebko, Dmitry Hvorostovsky, Maria Gulegina, Jose Cura. They came to congratulate dear Elena Vasilyevna. And later, behind the scenes, we agreed to meet here, exactly a year later, to celebrate her 76th birthday. Obraztsova herself only smiled silently. No one knew about her terminal illness at that time, except the closest ones. A few days after the anniversary ball, Elena Obraztsova flew to Germany for treatment. We were going to continue shooting a big movie in the new year, when all the holidays are over. And they ended.
