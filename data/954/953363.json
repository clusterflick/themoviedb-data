At the Staatsoper Stuttgart, stage director Árpád Schilling tries to answer this mythological, political and existential question, lying at the core of Richard Wagners Lohengrin. A wonder! A miracle!, the men and women of Brabant agreed when, against all expectations, someone stood up for Elsa and invalidated the allegations made by the plaintiff Telramund. And yet he does the most normal thing in the world: to help a person in distress. So why is there a need for this savior, surrounded by the aura of mystery, whose name and origin even his new wife Elsa cannot ask? Why does the collective body abdicates its moral and political responsibilities and surrenders them to a single individual? And when does the providential man stops being a savior and becomes a threat?","popularity":0.0492,"poster_path":"/uLNiPbv5kUR4ERX1pyZOMHyCSGh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":223,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Richard Wagner: Lohengrin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Wagner: Lohengrin","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Lohengrin","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1485863,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Árpád Schilling","original_name":"Árpád Schilling","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/f477he1vgNYDKVXtDTg3ANm5oo.jpg","credit_id":"623baa145541fa00494ddcfc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1577319,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Cornelius Meister","original_name":"Cornelius Meister","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623bab029affc0008a44a16e","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3477765,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Raimund Orfeo Voigt","original_name":"Raimund Orfeo Voigt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623bab6935c30a0049791ca7","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3477766,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Tina Kloempken","original_name":"Tina Kloempken","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623bab99e942be005c88a387","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3477769,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Támás Banyai","original_name":"Támás Banyai","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623babb4211ce50088be6bfe","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3477770,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Miron Hakenbeck","original_name":"Miron Hakenbeck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623babc9180dea00477f4486","department":"Crew","job":"Dramaturgy"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1485863,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Árpád Schilling","original_name":"Árpád Schilling","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/f477he1vgNYDKVXtDTg3ANm5oo.jpg","credit_id":"623babead1a893005cc77100","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1003,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3HPo3dw0d0cgp3evgiSOIrLKzyQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1783}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uLNiPbv5kUR4ERX1pyZOMHyCSGh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":849}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"},{"id":294379,"name":"staatsoper stuttgart"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
