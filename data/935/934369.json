He dashed off some sentimental guff called, \"When Willie Came to Say Good-Night,\" and it was punk. He threw it in the wastebasket but when his friend came in he discovered it and set out to sell it. He finally found a magazine editor who gave him a check for $500, and it was like picking money off a bush. The author, who was an old bachelor and a kid hater, was tickled to death to get the dough, but when letters came in congratulating him on his excellent poem and sympathizing with him, he was bored to death.","popularity":0.1377,"poster_path":"/fg4woAGIjswiWV4PiTVds9oQEEW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fable of 'The Author and the Dear Public and the Plate of Mush'","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1518392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lester Cuneo","original_name":"Lester Cuneo","popularity":0.0356,"profile_path":"/nDQajRQ72bHC4JRzhC1mKZVxc6g.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ernest Coppie","credit_id":"61fbf6341e259a001df2417c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1269128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Dunkinson","original_name":"Harry Dunkinson","popularity":0.1724,"profile_path":"/uFeYdxINTxnjuEEcrKwhA4ZZ92.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"His Friend","credit_id":"61fbf644eee18600cd3d356d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1363921,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"George Ade","original_name":"George Ade","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fbf6235c324700455108c9","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0003908","wikidata_id":"Q3986894","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fg4woAGIjswiWV4PiTVds9oQEEW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
