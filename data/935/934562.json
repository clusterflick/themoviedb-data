The old man, with his daughter, has occupied the same cabin for years, and refuses to sell his holdings. The superintendent wires the general manager, who sends Broncho Billy, his assistant, with orders to get possession of the land at any cost. Broncho offers the old man an enormous amount, but is flatly refused. The daughter then leads Broncho into the yard, where he is shown the grave in which her mother has been laid to rest several years before. This is their reason for refusing to sell.","popularity":0.0868,"poster_path":"/6ja0dQuxRjLF05rIKNjgFhALuio.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1914-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Broncho Billy's Decision","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44879,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gilbert M.
