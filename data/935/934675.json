His hands on the skin of the conga peel back the legacy of colonialism while navigating the politics of culture and global migration. One of the world’s foremost exponents of Afro-Latin music, Santos, through his mixed Puerto Rican & Cape Verdean heritage, musical storytelling and legendary percussion classes, strives to unite and expand his kaleidoscopic audience.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/uItIEsGPLOztpvzNHCIFU1Nfpno.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Santos–Skin to Skin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2931523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Santos","original_name":"John Santos","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"61fdd0ecfe5c9100df31f72a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2974589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aida Salazar","original_name":"Aida Salazar","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"61fdd0f4dd926a0042c5b8f7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1612448,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Palmieri","original_name":"Eddie Palmieri","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"61fdd0fcd37197004200cd93","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3413400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raul Rekow","original_name":"Raul Rekow","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/hSTznBxE1iDrIKbCKZxoDx0qhWp.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"61fdd101d18572010a0f5371","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3413402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Orestes Vilato","original_name":"Orestes Vilato","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/5rpIk8rZo7tWPsfiIXWJjRng3Vb.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"61fdd10bab684900f4f15629","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2219679,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kathryn Golden","original_name":"Kathryn Golden","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fdccdaab6849001b90a93a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt17677996","wikidata_id":"Q111940889","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.755,"height":2648,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uItIEsGPLOztpvzNHCIFU1Nfpno.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
