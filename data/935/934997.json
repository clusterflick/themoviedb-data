Would a brave new world of improved human beings be waiting for us? The documentary DNA Dreams features a new generation of scientists at BGI, China’s leading genomics research institute.  The film follows eighteen-year-old Zhao Bowen, who wants to find the genetic basis of intelligence by analysing the DNA of 2,000 highly gifted children. At BGI’s cloning lab, twenty-five-year-old Lin Lin produces pigs in all shapes and forms. Deeply in love with her work, she feels ‘like a mother’ to the piglets that are conceived under her microscope.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":"/zLi5hxGIc7DNBcUfJRt7cic3800.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Beijing Genomics Institute delves into the genetic code in search of the stuff from which geniuses are made.","title":"DNA Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310510,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bregtje van der Haak","original_name":"Bregtje van der Haak","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fd9e89481382001c8ee5f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2524709,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brigit Dopheide","original_name":"Brigit Dopheide","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fd9eb80e597b006ae78140","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2642398","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zLi5hxGIc7DNBcUfJRt7cic3800.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
