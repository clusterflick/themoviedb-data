Throughout the exploration of smoke sculptures created by cloud chasers, (LA)HORDE seeks to give shape to a latent moment within the Foundationâ€™s transition. The smoke occupies the space with a volatile and magical aesthetic, exploring its potential to welcome artworks and artistic projects in development. It bears witness to a space in mutation, whose shapes are yet to be defined.","popularity":0.0563,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cloud Chasers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2006580,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arthur Harel","original_name":"Arthur Harel","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fb143b8c0a4800c0fafda4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2006577,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marine Brutti","original_name":"Marine Brutti","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fb1445cb8028001c56a884","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3131067,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"(LA)HORDE","original_name":"(LA)HORDE","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fb144f9e401201165e0da9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2006579,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Debrouwer","original_name":"Jonathan Debrouwer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fb145864de3500b75d17bc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
