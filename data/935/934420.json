One day while walking down the street he ran squat into a dame who looked like a million dollars to him. At last he realized he had spotted the queen of the human race. From that time on he tried in every possible way to learn her name and address, but nary a soul did he know who could arrange an introduction. He worried himself sick, and his doctor ordered him away to a summer resort. Still she was constantly on his mind. One day she blew in at the summer hotel, and after two years of waiting he met her. That was plenty, her line of gab queered her from the start. Next day Mr. Cooley beat it for home. Moral: Many who look the limit do not listen very well.","popularity":0.1546,"poster_path":"/uPX6JFIEdrpcYsCfDFVQIyLT4vv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fable of 'The Long Range Lover and the Lollypalooze'","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1269128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Dunkinson","original_name":"Harry Dunkinson","popularity":0.1724,"profile_path":"/uFeYdxINTxnjuEEcrKwhA4ZZ92.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Blackstone Cooley","credit_id":"61fc0cdfd100b6006a516c95","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1267852,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Drew","original_name":"Lillian Drew","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/1bJWXeB7HPo2jZ8tY1lxYfH6dm.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Blackstone's Dream Girl","credit_id":"61fc0cec8c0a4800c0fc4e01","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1363921,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"George Ade","original_name":"George Ade","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fc0cccdfaae900f5e3e8a6","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0003918","wikidata_id":"Q3986928","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uPX6JFIEdrpcYsCfDFVQIyLT4vv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
