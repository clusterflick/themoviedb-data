Recounted with the distance of a lifetime, the protagonists narrate events that range from military preparation through their defeat on Cuban beaches, the vexations of the prison and their own liberation, to the return to American territory. The love of country, the horrors of war and the feeling of abandonment (not having the promised help), are thoroughly relived by these men who have not stopped missing their motherland.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Veritas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3410013,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eliecer Jiménez Almeida","original_name":"Eliecer Jiménez Almeida","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fb2249fe6c1800688d33dc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
