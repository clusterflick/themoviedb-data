The film uses the classic werewolf narrative as a lens through which to explore broader themes of transformation, memory, and the psychology and physicality that form our sense of self. The film, which is set on a fictional island off the coast of New England in the late 1980s, follows the intersecting experiences of several characters connected through a medical clinic, to a secret history shared by inhabitants of the town.","popularity":0.0904,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The White Wolf","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2603245,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sue de Beer","original_name":"Sue de Beer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fd50cbbf0f6300dd00b1b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
