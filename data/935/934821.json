Few geological formations evoke such an intense emotional response. This great chasm not only awes our senses, it harbors a multitude of wildlife: mule deer, moutain lions, coyotes, bighorn sheep, wild turkey, blue heron and desert tortoises. The Grand Canyon is also home to the kaibab squirrel, found nowhere else on the planet.  More than 2,000 years ago, the Anasazi Indians lived in this region. Our program includes an exclusive segment on Shaman's Gallery, where many Anasazi rock paintings have been preserved.  Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed the Grand Canyon a national park in 1908, saying \"do nothing to mar its grandeur, keep it for your children, your children's children, and all who come after you.\"  This video is part of a DVD set entitled America's National Park Collection and is DVD 4 out of 6.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/y8tM13PA3BghOtn01xv87hn2gSA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grand Canyon: The World's Great Natural Wonder","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1499,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y8tM13PA3BghOtn01xv87hn2gSA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":999}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
