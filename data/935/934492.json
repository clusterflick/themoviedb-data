A trauma in the past –the death of her two children– left her completely blind, and today she dedicates herself to blind photography, a particular discipline that finds new expressive forms by exploring and experimenting with what is conventionally taken for a disadvantage. A creative process that reflects different life experiences, returning in 35mm mental images informed by touch, smell and hearing, which encapsulate another way of being in a world saturated with images. A member of the Seeing With Photography collective, Sonia is dedicated to seeing beyond sight, and teaching others to do so. This is the remarkable story of his life and work","popularity":0.1678,"poster_path":"/4QGQXIGdq37uEXLTc0r3xxWNdpm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27306,"logo_path":null,"name":"PDVSA La Estancia","origin_country":""},{"id":1388,"logo_path":"/85fUh6K8SxjWEeRYnaWXKLt5O80.png","name":"Centro Nacional Autónomo de Cinematografía","origin_country":"VE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El laberinto de lo posible","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Labyrinth of Possibility","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3411220,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wanadi Siso","original_name":"Wanadi Siso","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fc2fb2d7a70a009a8f2331","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3014844,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mauricio Siso","original_name":"Mauricio Siso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670d814742e1391c5666c9fd","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3014844,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mauricio Siso","original_name":"Mauricio Siso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670d8154f58a9206aa419924","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69351,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nascuy Linares","original_name":"Nascuy Linares","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670d816dd5f93a3da0bbedc4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2390804","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4QGQXIGdq37uEXLTc0r3xxWNdpm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":236267,"name":"visual impairment"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"El laberinto de lo posible trailer oficial","key":"Is1Fu8oaOmk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-08-03T18:31:53.000Z","id":"670d8874d5f93a3da0bbf171"}]}}}
