Never has France known such a concentration of private media. A few billionaire industrialists, owners of televisions, radios, newspapers use their media to defend their private interests. To the detriment of information of public interest. By hiding what is essential, by magnifying what is accessory, these media shape, orientate, hysterize for some the debate. With the complicity of certain political leaders, who willingly accept it. Mediapart and Premières Lignes tell you what goes on behind the scenes in the media.","popularity":0.146,"poster_path":"/bQFJ0PX746r2RAsumUmnoNgMctv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160393,"logo_path":"/bp6oiezKSY1kI7YO9B5ZmOBgHip.png","name":"Mediapart","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":85699,"logo_path":"/7F4qG35w4S9FOM5pXZolh2Vy7xp.png","name":"Premières Lignes","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Who killed public debate?","title":"Media Crash","video":false,"vote_average":8.1,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1143786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cyril Hanouna","original_name":"Cyril Hanouna","popularity":0.3132,"profile_path":"/36xWhwtrGgQu85FZ4q3fMV5TvuJ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67e150fec2d819df69c769d3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2710707,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valentine Oberti","original_name":"Valentine Oberti","popularity":0.1285,"profile_path":"/zYJPqk05TM9od3xXeaHaLU0d7TA.jpg","credit_id":"61fbf5317a97ab00732a5388","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2038527,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Luc Hermann","original_name":"Luc Hermann","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fbf53f7a97ab00e4661210","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt17526514","wikidata_id":"Q110901333","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qr140MU7Dv2Y0TsAS3iIMxqoFf0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bQFJ0PX746r2RAsumUmnoNgMctv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Jour2Fête","release_date":"2022-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"VOD","release_date":"2022-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD","release_date":"2022-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
