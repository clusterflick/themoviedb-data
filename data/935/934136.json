Claudia and Santiago got married and are preparing to go to study in the United States, Amalyn went to Tokyo to live her dream of being a dancer and Melissa, in Australia, worries about raising her daughter with Venezuelan values ​​despite the distance. For a year and a half they were in charge of recording their surroundings with cameras and cell phones.
