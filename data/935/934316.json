The father, Zheng, has been living in Hungary since the year 1990, yet he still holds a critical attitude towards the ‘western way’ of educating children, so he fights a lot with his wife on this. His children are now learning piano, violin, singing, calligraphy, ping-pong, badminton, swimming, kung fu, Chinese, English and so on. They are busy attending different courses every day after school, even every weekend.
