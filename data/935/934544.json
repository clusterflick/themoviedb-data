At the height of the civil rights movement in the United States, the three men were asked to represent the best of American ideals abroad while facing discrimination at home. Oft reputed as “pale, male and Yale,” the U.S. State Department fiercely maintained and cultivated the Foreign Service’s elitist character and was one of the last federal agencies to desegregate. Through rare archival footage, in-depth oral histories and interviews with family members, colleagues and diplomats, the film paints a portrait of three men who left a lasting impact on the content and character of the Foreign Service and changed American diplomacy forever.","popularity":0.4979,"poster_path":"/xXkDH5KyvakYmuOD77u3WsNotWT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The American Diplomat","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285391,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kiley Kraskouskas","original_name":"Kiley Kraskouskas","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fc499534e15200e4eb7eeb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3411357,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leola Calzolai-Stewart","original_name":"Leola Calzolai-Stewart","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fc496a1e259a0113e124f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3411359,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rachell Shapiro","original_name":"Rachell Shapiro","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fc49836f31af45bed9d988","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16673042","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2878,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xXkDH5KyvakYmuOD77u3WsNotWT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1919}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"PBS","release_date":"2022-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The American Diplomat | American Experience | PBS","key":"xddUdN1OSYo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2022-01-18T14:00:22.000Z","id":"630c6508b3e627007d459fba"}]}}}
