During the first, in 1942, she drinks her way through the lecture, revealing messy romances and illnesses. In the second, 25 years later, she confronts her mortality, reminiscing on her novel and play The Member of The Wedding; also on her twice failed marriage and romances of both sexes, ending on the credo she forged with her husband. Agape love matters in this life, not Erotic. Ironically, Carson McCullers, despite her compassion, is destined to solitude.","popularity":0.1223,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lover, Beloved","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1246000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suzanne Vega","original_name":"Suzanne Vega","popularity":0.1395,"profile_path":"/4uiPVuWfJEujgUGxF2u6Ur8pZYN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"61fb80118c0a48006905b0b9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150956,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Tully","original_name":"Michael Tully","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/l6xBAwGtUhq8ZTptpsuJYQ79H8f.jpg","credit_id":"61fb801efe6c1800c20a7182","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11566200","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"SXSW","release_date":"2022-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
