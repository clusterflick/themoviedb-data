The story follows Aparicio and his wife, Alma Rosa, as they welcome a new priest, Manuel, to their coastal village. As Manuel becomes acquainted with the community, he discovers that the village is slated for demolition to make way for a tourist development. Deeply moved by the villagers' plight, Manuel joins the local fishermen in their struggle to defend their land. During this time, he also finds himself drawn to Alma Rosa, leading to personal and moral dilemmas. The developers, aware of Manuel's growing influence and his feelings for Alma Rosa, begin to monitor his actions closely. The film delves into the complexities of human relationships and the fight against displacement.","popularity":0.1054,"poster_path":"/9iyRVFOsD8t7npdENb4DYv6EfUh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52070,"logo_path":"/7fKOckIiy37RsgUwRsraWAFLXak.png","name":"Cine Seis Ocho","origin_country":"VE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manuel","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1356690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asdrúbal Meléndez","original_name":"Asdrúbal Meléndez","popularity":0.0768,"profile_path":"/pU0w4LPlc3dhSjohPJYF8mDsvdS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Manuel","credit_id":"66e2a04d0000000000b91563","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1421194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Urdaneta","original_name":"Virginia Urdaneta","popularity":0.118,"profile_path":"/iV9aN43Y9WMStVdDGNnY6skCKQi.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Alma Rosa","credit_id":"66e2a05c0000000000b91568","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":987027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Víctor Cuica","original_name":"Víctor Cuica","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/sWpgv3VAqARPevYYgOTpFUOHWDD.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Caraota","credit_id":"66e2a06b0000000000b91572","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1471244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julio Mota","original_name":"Julio Mota","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":"/trz0Qb2Kdj1fCmk9BXZZY0eLKyb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Aparicio","credit_id":"66e2a0780000000000b91576","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4938076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Marina Yrausquín","original_name":"Olga Marina Yrausquín","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"66e2a0989013fe8722237b50","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4968445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kiddio España","original_name":"Kiddio España","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"","credit_id":"66f81144e7d24ebb2ba21645","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4968447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lilo Farías","original_name":"Lilo Farías","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"","credit_id":"66f81161a6293e3d76a20cec","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":989865,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olegario Barrera","original_name":"Olegario Barrera","popularity":0.1117,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"","credit_id":"67e16c96e4a9c86906081dd4","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1349763,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alfredo J.
