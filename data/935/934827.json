He found his subjects in the dance halls, cabarets, circuses, and brothels of the Montmartre neighborhood, where middle-class visitors came for a whiff of excitement laced with danger. His images of performers at the Moulin Rouge, Chat Noir, and other fashionable nightspots transformed the poets, singers, and dancers of Montmartre  including Aristide Bruant, Jane Avril, and Yvette Guilbert  into celebrities. This film traces the relationship between the aristocratic painter and the avant-garde culture of Montmartre, using works of art by Lautrec and his colleagues, rare archival footage and sound recordings, period photographs, and interviews with contemporary scholars.","popularity":0.1796,"poster_path":"/A0DigMpasMdxOAyDIzsx39sHsq5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Toulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3412361,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carroll Moore","original_name":"Carroll Moore","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fd2b17bf0f63011a67ca50","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3412364,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carroll Moore","original_name":"Carroll Moore","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fd2b2c7a97ab011f9c0dfa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3412366,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carroll Moore","original_name":"Carroll Moore","popularity":0.1223,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fd2b45d100b600d7e7fc34","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i92IIrXBF2o2v7sQjwOG3Dz1qKn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":524},{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/A0DigMpasMdxOAyDIzsx39sHsq5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":522}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5881,"name":"toulouse, france"},{"id":292085,"name":"lautrec"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
