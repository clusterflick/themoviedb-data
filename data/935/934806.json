The stills have been painted, drawn over, or collaged so that the felled works become reanimated: An Assyrian statue housed at Mosulâ€™s central museum morphs into a cross-hatched breaching mermaid; another gains a polka-dot skin; yet another crashes to the ground enveloped in writhing pink roses. These whimsically patterned phoenixes, emerging from the ruins of sacred artifacts, provide a determinedly dreamy rejoinder to unimaginably destructive acts of censorship and constitute a celebration in their own right.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Big Rock Candy Mountain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3412256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ramin Haerizadeh","original_name":"Ramin Haerizadeh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fd0a2bae6f09006b23a2c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3412257,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hesam Rahmanian","original_name":"Hesam Rahmanian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fd0a5064de35004421eeb9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2810475,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rokni Haerizadeh","original_name":"Rokni Haerizadeh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fd0a3efe6c1800688f76a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2022-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
