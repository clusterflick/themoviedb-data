It was smuggled in from China years before. Chief Knox is notified and believes Smirney guilty when he finds a diagram in his pocket, and following it, finds a necklace. Ho Fing-Tang, a Chinaman, studying law in the office, is not suspected by Knox, but Spider, a newspaper reporter, believes differently. Ho Fing-Tang is injured and in a delirium keeps repeating \"Huns 764.\" Spider goes to the office and from a book called \"Hun's 129 Reports,\" he extracts the real necklace. The stones Knox found prove to be paste.","popularity":0.2396,"poster_path":"/a1pDXOrAUiAJkyo9kj9VT7tPiWF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Within Three Hundred Pages","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1313114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Travers","original_name":"Richard Travers","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/ibXu8PEoEZXQEAt6NjRbMYH1V6m.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Spider - the Reporter","credit_id":"61fc491d414291006b5cb234","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1319161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Dunbar","original_name":"Helen Dunbar","popularity":0.1343,"profile_path":"/nErEJVdKwRlDuOH6rcBx5isXKWL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mrs. Stuyvesant","credit_id":"61fc492a8c0a4869ee156772","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryant Washburn","original_name":"Bryant Washburn","popularity":0.1659,"profile_path":"/5UlSMWoAnoXIoa5cTv7yf1yECRn.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ho Fing-Tang","credit_id":"61fc493864de35004420fda8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Cossar","original_name":"John Cossar","popularity":0.0569,"profile_path":"/eSNYJl4CY2nJkRO3VXY5V5hlQ3e.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lawyer Smirney","credit_id":"61fc4945dfaae9001dbbe9a0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2563435,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rapley Holmes","original_name":"Rapley Holmes","popularity":0.2228,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Police Chief Knox","credit_id":"61fc495468929c0122a4ba41","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1173776","wikidata_id":"Q15121615","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a1pDXOrAUiAJkyo9kj9VT7tPiWF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
