Focussing on his relatives who still live there, I Am From Nowhere examines the media’s obsession with Miková, thus reflecting on fame, filming as well as being filmed, and on Warhol’s legendary “15 minutes of fame”. More than that however, it is a film about the dreams and hopes of the people there, about the universal human dream of a better life, and an “American Dream”, which turns out to be completely different than expected.","popularity":0.1425,"poster_path":"/wRl6XPixtPLUGBMV4G7yuIdh5z5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":169146,"logo_path":null,"name":"Navigator Film KEG","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2002-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am from Nowhere","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1199494,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georg Misch","original_name":"Georg Misch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fb054fae6f09006b2116fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2673126,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Silvia Beck","original_name":"Silvia Beck","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fb05b60c4c16009ba939a9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1199494,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georg Misch","original_name":"Georg Misch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fb05c0eee186490a1971fc","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2673126,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Silvia Beck","original_name":"Silvia Beck","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fb05ced100b6001bf69a3e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":564797,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michael Palm","original_name":"Michael Palm","popularity":0.1664,"profile_path":"/C4xAof0LLUfbsF0Q5cM86F4gUD.jpg","credit_id":"61fb05df64de35008fb402d2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3409847,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mikhail Alperin","original_name":"Mikhail Alperin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fb05fb1e259a0113ded029","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1671733,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marián Gregorovič","original_name":"Marián Gregorovič","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fb0608dfaae900c6b9a3c0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3409848,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rudolf Potancok","original_name":"Rudolf Potancok","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fb0611b6abc400687e27ef","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0436413","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wRl6XPixtPLUGBMV4G7yuIdh5z5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
