In the middle of their 10-month regatta in Lisbon, they were experiencing a tipping point - to move on or stop. This story is about how to stop being afraid and start living your life, and not the life of your children, how to escape from a pandemic, lockdowns and restrictions. And how to re-learn to enjoy the little things, like water in the shower or the absence of mold on the ceiling.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unbounded Family","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3411373,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sonia Bubar","original_name":"Sonia Bubar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fc4d76fe6c1800f43b1949","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
