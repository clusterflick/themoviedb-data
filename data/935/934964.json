The first Gink who blew in wanted to know the correct time, and not a cent's worth did he buy. The next was one of those hurry-up guys who wanted a city directory and wanted to know if Murphy was spelled with an \"F.\" Shortly after Estelle came in and wanted to wait for Laura. She was dying for a drink of plain water, she couldn't drink soda water because the gas got up her nose. Finally, when Laura came she bought a postage stamp, and not having any pennies, said she'd be in later to pay for it.","popularity":0.1621,"poster_path":"/4bYDkdNuPcWVUNone3en377SIow.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fable 'Proving That Spongers are Found in a Drug Store'","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Bolder","original_name":"Robert Bolder","popularity":0.1293,"profile_path":"/cdAlyrXvcWzTpA2JI4sIHIdwJrA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Druggist","credit_id":"61fd8b9d75f1ad0067562736","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1363921,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"George Ade","original_name":"George Ade","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fd8b866d1bb2008a569568","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0003899","wikidata_id":"Q3986871","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4bYDkdNuPcWVUNone3en377SIow.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
