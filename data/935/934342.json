He finds his work unappreciated, and is unable to earn a living. One day while strolling in the park with his wife, Helen, he saves a little girl's life by stopping her runaway horse, but breaks his finger in doing so. He is then unable to paint, and is forced to take a position in a factory, but tells his wife that he is writing stories for a magazine.
