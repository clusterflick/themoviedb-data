She plans to leave with Felipe, her fiancé, who decides to leave her to return to his family. Tomás and Gustavo plan the assault on a money exchange house to achieve the happiness that life does not give them. Vargas and Gutiérrez tighten the thread of good and evil in a fight where abuse and force win the battle against naivety and impotence. A bag full of money, an unknown path, the number of hours, and the steps of those who follow them, will make it increasingly difficult to cross the mountain and flee to another country. Cerro el Ávila, which borders Caracas, will be the stage where plans and destinations will change course.","popularity":0.1913,"poster_path":"/3DJp1BLR1hBQtWFlIELVSic0n1c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plan
