He goes to his old sweetheart and asks her to return his love letters. She does so on condition that he tell the new girl of their affair. He does not live up to his promise, but tells her that she is the first girl he has ever loved. In the meantime, he has lost his letters, and the new sweetheart, upon finding them, returns them to the owner. From this source she is advised to have nothing more to do with him unless she is convinced in her own mind that he is kneeling to her in spirit at all times.","popularity":0.2136,"poster_path":"/mLAADRmIAlZcSCwOAyPQjtHAHMH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Verdict","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryant Washburn","original_name":"Bryant Washburn","popularity":0.1659,"profile_path":"/5UlSMWoAnoXIoa5cTv7yf1yECRn.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Man","credit_id":"61fbea1f8c0a4800441252f2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1404014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beverly Bayne","original_name":"Beverly Bayne","popularity":0.1109,"profile_path":"/hsOe46QGG3ghZC8TELhh3sFL5oD.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Young Woman","credit_id":"61fbea355c32470095035019","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1615194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerda Holmes","original_name":"Gerda Holmes","popularity":0.1045,"profile_path":"/iHiqQVf4VBLBanpfm1Ao8BICCSB.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The Older Woman","credit_id":"61fbea435c324700ddaaf08d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1313114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Travers","original_name":"Richard Travers","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/ibXu8PEoEZXQEAt6NjRbMYH1V6m.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"61fbea4dfe6c1800c20ab8ef","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2563435,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rapley Holmes","original_name":"Rapley Holmes","popularity":0.2228,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"61fbea55eee186490a1a81d2","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30409,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Edward T.
