A filmmaker, struggling to reconcile his desires with his faith, sets off to the strict monastery in search of answers. When he arrives, his presence is not welcomed and the only monk who will speak with him is an outcast who prefers ice cream and Slayer to meditation. Together they forge an unlikely friendship that leads them to higher truths and occasionally, a little trouble. Shot over five years on three continents, Crows are White is an exploration of truth, faith and love, from the top of a mountain to the bottom of a sundae.","popularity":0.0819,"poster_path":"/geoP7QnvrlLrvLw8aUctAGT2Zxt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34777,"logo_path":"/slfGgHfiKJsHjoeAhfLykCflt6h.png","name":"MEMORY","origin_country":"US"},{"id":92455,"logo_path":"/yIY6pphobFpoaAoUYq4HAjX72Rn.png","name":"Argent Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crows Are White","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1973901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ahsen Nadeem","original_name":"Ahsen Nadeem","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63e00cc4ce5d8200cd90bac2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1973901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ahsen Nadeem","original_name":"Ahsen Nadeem","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622e3f2b5a5ed000789e5d99","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1056219,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kimberley Hassett","original_name":"Kimberley Hassett","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622e3ddc2866fa0045504df1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3464384,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Matt H.
