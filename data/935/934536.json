He visited Roger Talbot, holder of the mortgage, who handed him two cigars. Uncle Brewster was dying for a smoke, but he remembered what Aunt Mahaley told him about cutting down expenses, and traded the cigars for a couple of boiled eggs saving the price of lunch. At a fruit exhibit he filled his carpet bag, saving supper money. Before leaving the hotel he packed away everything in sight, so when he returned to Aunt Mahaley he was minus railroad fare but plus many towels and hotel souvenirs.","popularity":0.1018,"poster_path":"/6mXjXab1wSGWH6YzkFMhmO5vEcl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fable of 'How Uncle Brewster Was Too Shifty For the Tempter'","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3315739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Owens","original_name":"Frank Owens","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Uncle Brewster","credit_id":"61fc442c7390c000e294bd94","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1449226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Dayton","original_name":"Frank Dayton","popularity":0.065,"profile_path":"/yjuRXnzbbZkIY7JnPdmeONrRR8p.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Roger Talbot","credit_id":"61fc444b07216600431cf63c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1363921,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"George Ade","original_name":"George Ade","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fc4403559d22006a0a6f02","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0003902","wikidata_id":"Q3986882","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6mXjXab1wSGWH6YzkFMhmO5vEcl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
