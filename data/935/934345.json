There was one chap in particular who looked awfully good to her, but the younger girls were hot on his trail, and did their utmost to keep Clara out of his way. Finally Clara got rid of her competitors in the Man Hunt when they all went to a summer resort. She was surrounded by Suitors, and Mr. Gibbs was very much in evidence. The afternoons that followed were a repetition of the first day, while the girls up at the lake were making a fuss over some little Freshman.","popularity":0.1765,"poster_path":"/jHcIvhXmZyJq6Z14EKPGgKFAxeE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fable of The Adult Girl Who Got Busy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1615194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerda Holmes","original_name":"Gerda Holmes","popularity":0.1045,"profile_path":"/iHiqQVf4VBLBanpfm1Ao8BICCSB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Clara","credit_id":"61fbe5d0072166006da8475b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1313114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Travers","original_name":"Richard Travers","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/ibXu8PEoEZXQEAt6NjRbMYH1V6m.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Clara's Conquest","credit_id":"61fbe5decb802800bfe6046f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1363921,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"George Ade","original_name":"George Ade","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fbe5c01e259a00450c377c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0003907","wikidata_id":"Q3986893","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jHcIvhXmZyJq6Z14EKPGgKFAxeE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
