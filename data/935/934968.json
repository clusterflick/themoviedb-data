The focus is on the Lubmin nuclear power plant, which was shut down in 1990, or natural disasters such as floods.","popularity":0.1767,"poster_path":"/hf9YbEyseKSymybRF4MssOSzInG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":169280,"logo_path":null,"name":"Roland Blum Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The environmental crimes in the GDR and how they were solved - a moving story.","title":"Mitgift - Ostdeutschland im Wandel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3412914,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roland Blum","original_name":"Roland Blum","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fd8eb51b70ae010d193dc9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3412914,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roland Blum","original_name":"Roland Blum","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fd8edb1b70ae0067df781c","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287533,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Wolfgang Lindig","original_name":"Wolfgang Lindig","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fd8f1fe19de900ba5b2c9f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3412921,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Norbert Kleiner","original_name":"Norbert Kleiner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fd8f313520e8008b23679b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1012231,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gudrun Steinbrück","original_name":"Gudrun Steinbrück","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fd8f4c4c1d9a00425bbacf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3412914,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roland Blum","original_name":"Roland Blum","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fd8f7915a4a10114b8d764","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3412924,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Isidora Diefenbach","original_name":"Isidora Diefenbach","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61fd8f904813820067cb77e5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hf9YbEyseKSymybRF4MssOSzInG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":724}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1657,"name":"eastern germany"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2014-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"MITGIFT - OSTDEUTSCHLAND IM WANDEL | Trailer german deutsch [HD]","key":"qg8gaj8DVVc","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-02-24T13:28:56.000Z","id":"61fd907f021cee0042a334ed"}]}}}
