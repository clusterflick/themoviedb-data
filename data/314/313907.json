The narrator searches through documents and reconstructs the life of Lela: in the Middle Ages she was accused of witchcraft; in the 20th century she finds herself in the midst of war, in the future she will leave the planet. Lela's individual destiny is being inscribed into the fate of humanity by means of layering the image; only television shots of the war in former Yugoslavia are presented 'in one layer', clean. The television image has become the only document, the war - the only certainty. Autobus discloses two images of the electronic picture: the one that creates reality, and the other that creates artefacts.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/zdc7Dpa8jNp8z90zX2KrCn9pQbh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68130,"logo_path":null,"name":"TV Slovenija","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1404571,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Neven Korda Andrič","original_name":"Neven Korda Andrič","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"549e01719251413129006f5e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1404572,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Zemira Alajbegović Pečovnik","original_name":"Zemira Alajbegović Pečovnik","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"549e017dc3a3682f1e006a61","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zdc7Dpa8jNp8z90zX2KrCn9pQbh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
