The men, who are so different, become so close that one day Pieper asks the young man for a big favor. Arnold has a capricious and rather volatile daughter named Lale, who, in his opinion, gets up to a lot of mischief in Europe. To put an end to this, Pieper quickly asks Richard to marry Lale, who is unknown to him. In order to make the marriage attractive to him, the fat old man also offers “prize money” of $5,000, which the poor student could really use.","popularity":0.3222,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1950-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Das Mädchen aus der Südsee","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1181392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angelika Hauff","original_name":"Angelika Hauff","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":"/p148VE6gKuZggavrmFFrW9tTDyd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lale Pieper","credit_id":"549b6954925141312c0023bd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hardy Krüger","original_name":"Hardy Krüger","popularity":0.6461,"profile_path":"/mWykFvz2kjBtx8uA3X3yK6mmWlH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Richard Kirbach","credit_id":"549b6961c3a3682f1e0027e2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Mosbacher","original_name":"Peter Mosbacher","popularity":0.1636,"profile_path":"/bpcRo9z02qkoi0RAGPSwXAta5nJ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ralph Wandrey","credit_id":"549b6973c3a3682f1e0027ea","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Florath","original_name":"Albert Florath","popularity":0.2963,"profile_path":"/ciYf1a97dXw3J3RnTpH0nPajPYk.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Arnold Pieper","credit_id":"549b69a292514131290028ea","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erna Sellmer","original_name":"Erna Sellmer","popularity":0.1304,"profile_path":"/2ostUH9Fy0kTmF6ehYqioyRN2fA.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Wilhelma","credit_id":"549b69b0c3a3682f210027a1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Käthe Haack","original_name":"Käthe Haack","popularity":0.2035,"profile_path":"/moKY8JWgzcjEgZw769d3qyd9S3X.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Frau Wellenkamp","credit_id":"549b69c5c3a3682f230028c8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Giller","original_name":"Walter Giller","popularity":0.1336,"profile_path":"/nKl57GnTDjd3fTTfMNFQ8PKOmmH.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Lothar","credit_id":"549b69d09251414bb2000e0c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hubert von Meyerinck","original_name":"Hubert von Meyerinck","popularity":0.1624,"profile_path":"/8APjW4PoDWOX3EmP0JHBsB06dpJ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"549b69d9925141312300273c","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz Schafheitlin","original_name":"Franz Schafheitlin","popularity":0.3509,"profile_path":"/waBnCjhX3M73pKaKDJFRyM7wKKN.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"549b69e2925141311f002715","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ah Yue Lou","original_name":"Ah Yue Lou","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Kurri","credit_id":"59c79fcd9251415b7705c115","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1708194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kurt Meister","original_name":"Kurt Meister","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5a1ca817925141032905e4c9","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Offenbach","original_name":"Joseph Offenbach","popularity":0.1621,"profile_path":"/lF70yduZfjD9b9rt9WvfkyKiKsE.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5a1ca822c3a3680b8f05c4ea","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":590667,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans Müller","original_name":"Hans Müller","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"549b6944c3a3682cd70009d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0042773","wikidata_id":"Q39049595","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1950-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
