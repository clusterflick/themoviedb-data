When the town bully picks a fight with Andy, he knocks him unconscious, and (thinking he has killed him) Andy rides into the hills. Merchant, jealous of Ann's admiration for Andy, bribes the sheriff to kill Andy, who has joined a band of outlaws in the wastelands. Forced to defend himself, Andy kills the sheriff, but later he saves the new sheriff's life and forces him to hear his story when he is placed in jeopardy by the outlaw band. Meanwhile, Ann, who has broken her engagement to Merchant, engages a lawyer to clear Andy, and he returns to find her awaiting him.","popularity":0.3694,"poster_path":"/7VTYrgzv1m0StBKtdj1jY33VT4H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1922-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A comedy drama in which a peace-loving Westerner proves a terror when roused to action.","title":"The Fighting Streak","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1052155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Mix","original_name":"Tom Mix","popularity":0.1651,"profile_path":"/qTaMWapR1sxjk6mdi3tvRsSMNks.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Andrew Lanning","credit_id":"549d7efd9251414e280016c5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patsy Ruth Miller","original_name":"Patsy Ruth Miller","popularity":0.175,"profile_path":"/etWQtdO78xxQFLvECkeqEAzs06o.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ann Withero","credit_id":"549d7f589251413123005c89","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1097472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sid Jordan","original_name":"Sid Jordan","popularity":0.0599,"profile_path":"/kvnhDr72SuFItTvjOrMK5poJiOx.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Bill Dozier","credit_id":"549d80199251413132005caf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bert Sprotte","original_name":"Bert Sprotte","popularity":0.1113,"profile_path":"/tvVZs3dunBBfL32jPvHGHU5ujFU.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Hal Dozier","credit_id":"549d80479251414bb20043fa","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1404340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerald Pring","original_name":"Gerald Pring","popularity":0.1042,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Charles Merchant","credit_id":"549d7f7a925141312f0063ec","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592835,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al Fremont","original_name":"Al Fremont","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Jasper Lanning","credit_id":"549d7fa1c3a3680b27004e5e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1295330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Fleming","original_name":"Bob Fleming","popularity":0.0942,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Chick Heath","credit_id":"549d80789251414e280016e6","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30293,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arthur Rosson","original_name":"Arthur Rosson","popularity":0.1973,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"549d7ea99251413123005c6e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33027,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Max Brand","original_name":"Max Brand","popularity":0.1883,"profile_path":"/o6fgwR1oYG46Jq6oJ7GJVCAbHFb.jpg","credit_id":"549d7ee09251414bb20043c9","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30293,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arthur Rosson","original_name":"Arthur Rosson","popularity":0.1973,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"549d7e99c3a3682f1b005d27","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1084977,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Daniel B.
