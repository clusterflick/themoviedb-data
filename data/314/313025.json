It is both a barrier and highway, a silver ribbon holding back the rugged landscapes of the west from the gentler plains to the east. On its journey south, the Shannon passes through a huge palette of rural landscapes, where on little-known backwaters, Ireland’s wild animals and plants still thrive as almost nowhere else. For a year, wildlife cameraman Colin Stafford-Johnson lives on the river, camping on its banks, exploring its countless tributaries in a traditional canoe, following the river from dawn to dusk through the four seasons, on a quest to film the natural history of the Shannon as it has never been seen or heard or experienced before.","popularity":0.4801,"poster_path":"/wKrLhwJxiAUJAiTdDmEmkw0hDwo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15964,"logo_path":null,"name":"PBS International","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ireland's Wild River","video":true,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Stafford-Johnson","original_name":"Colin Stafford-Johnson","popularity":0.093,"profile_path":"/cOqFmo9039YkOrm0t6msDi4mHdF.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself / Narrator","credit_id":"54976c91c3a3680511000204","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1183152,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Murray","original_name":"John Murray","popularity":0.0735,"profile_path":"/iRS3QM8np42qF3SBF11dgC2Xfig.jpg","credit_id":"5bbad8710e0a2616ad0089a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3549984","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eAs47j3ZfZWTepXFJRD7IywttcO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wKrLhwJxiAUJAiTdDmEmkw0hDwo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/rDvErXrewNSLHecVC7juHuxotkx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
