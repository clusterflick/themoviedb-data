Against all odds, the horse wins, and suddenly the young man is quite wealthy.","popularity":0.3504,"poster_path":"/iqmiLfkpWExtrqWp0bThazhtCCu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1930-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kibitzer","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Busybody","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Green","original_name":"Harry Green","popularity":0.0976,"profile_path":"/1tO4hqEg81n43bJT9riGLPbmicF.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ike Lazarus","credit_id":"54980bf29251416e2b00817d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":114767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Brian","original_name":"Mary Brian","popularity":0.173,"profile_path":"/ikRdqKBJ7UCAB1xNb67dVSYoOyZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Josie Lazarus","credit_id":"54980bfbc3a36802a90010f2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Hamilton","original_name":"Neil Hamilton","popularity":0.5186,"profile_path":"/23jm1XwaaBKWTp5fKs7kzThK4KZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Eddie Brown","credit_id":"54980c06c3a368054b00148f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1104843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Gran","original_name":"Albert Gran","popularity":0.0766,"profile_path":"/jKVCUwIDORHwExSKBdmZsq7LZKm.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"James Livingston","credit_id":"54980c12c3a3686ae900834c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":942165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Newell","original_name":"David Newell","popularity":0.1752,"profile_path":"/iWw1K3M9e8ktpxVmo17UHeDMCyL.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Bert Livingstone","credit_id":"577500e892514115000029fb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy Oliver","original_name":"Guy Oliver","popularity":0.1083,"profile_path":"/tLe4A808lGBfSenS42k1ZeAdZEO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"McGinty","credit_id":"54980c2292514130fc0068a0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1235622,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tenen Holtz","original_name":"Tenen Holtz","popularity":0.1695,"profile_path":"/qx1tZx2zHsfpJut1pEbpUUcuxfH.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Meyer","credit_id":"54980c2bc3a36802a90010f7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1402603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Fink","original_name":"Henry Fink","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Kikapoupolos","credit_id":"54980c3392514130fc0068a5","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":940214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Kohlmar","original_name":"Lee Kohlmar","popularity":0.147,"profile_path":"/tANnH4j9H2HSNbUy7Kdzjh1E5Pj.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Yankel","credit_id":"54980c3bc3a3680fc6005f6d","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":999884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"E.H.
