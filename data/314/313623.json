Fortress Europe is being built and the AFD would like to be in charge. The funded pension scheme is becoming a poverty trap for the average earner, so the only thing that helps is new enemy stereotypes to keep the democratically fooled at the bar where they are allowed to dance. Whoever controls the media rules the media democracy. The problems are not new, but they have evolved just as much as the program. Volker Pispers constantly updates his cabaret program and thus reflects the state of the republic: the ever new in the eternally same. Because while the media circus with its speech bubble jugglers makes us believe that something is constantly happening, virtually nothing is happening when it comes to the fundamental problems.  You look in vain for respect in Pispers' programs. Blunt, crass and direct, he oscillates between bitterly angry and charmingly witty when he thinks the absurdities of the world through to the end.","popularity":0.2318,"poster_path":"/kdG9IYpvnsD7AWCd132dQqK4e0s.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":159,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Volker
