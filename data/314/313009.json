But then he retired from showbiz and married the rich Joan. Now, after being dependent on his wife's money for many years, he's sick of it and wants to work again. A romantic affair with his stepdaughter, Shirley, gives him the guts to ask for a role. His former agent gets him one but it's with a small company in Vienna, Austria. The stress worsens his alcoholism; the tablets he takes to hide the effects lead him to hallucinations. When his wife and girlfriend appear at the same time, he's no longer capable of handling the situation.","popularity":0.6124,"poster_path":"/3CYuoCyO6wWTyntzECcHXsYj7PC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26093,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wien-Film","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":9156,"logo_path":null,"name":"Roxy
