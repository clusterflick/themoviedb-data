Fragments also features clips from such lost films as Cleopatra (1917), starring Theda Bara; The Miracle Man (1919), with Lon Chaney; He Comes Up Smiling (1918), starring Douglas Fairbanks; an early lost sound film, Gold Diggers of Broadway (1929), filmed in early Technicolor, and the only color footage of silent star Clara Bow, Red Hair (1928). The program is rounded out with interviews of film preservationists involved in identifying and restoring these films. Also featured is a new interview with Diana Serra Cary, best known as \"Baby Peggy\", one of the major American child stars of the silent era, who discusses one of the featured fragments, Darling of New York (1923).","popularity":0.6688,"poster_path":"/b6BcUkJQqTX16r5BUCBwtd2cO9P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42143,"logo_path":null,"name":"Flicker
