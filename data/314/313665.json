In the first of three sequences we see various images from nature against music: the sky, trees, leaves, a bird, water, sand, a beach. A little boy wanders along the beach observing the natural world around him. He walks and presently comes to a house and peers inside. The second sequence has no music. The narrator speaks of sculptor Alexander Calder and his work, as we see Calder in his workshop, cutting and creating unusual shapes, and seeing the resultant artworks. The last sequence has music as we view images of Calder's work. However, now they are intercut with images from nature so that we understand that Calder's inspiration is the natural world around him. The film ends as it began, with an image of the sun, now fading into the sky.","popularity":0.3002,"poster_path":"/d2wmZ03XjwqJFxkQgtq7IEYXuc6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52414,"logo_path":null,"name":"New World Film Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1950-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Works of Calder","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1403908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Calder","original_name":"Alexander Calder","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"549c34609251413129003e8b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Burgess Meredith","original_name":"Burgess Meredith","popularity":0.7166,"profile_path":"/2ozNyIbHChcqIBANwvCDpUZGA9b.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"549c3470c3a3682f16003c63","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1403911,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Herbert Matter","original_name":"Herbert Matter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"549c348e9251415dc10031e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1118807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Cage","original_name":"John Cage","popularity":0.1503,"profile_path":"/9gmtnfJV6dO81hNzxr2Nm3UGeNv.jpg","credit_id":"549c34b09251413129003e96","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Burgess Meredith","original_name":"Burgess Meredith","popularity":0.7166,"profile_path":"/2ozNyIbHChcqIBANwvCDpUZGA9b.jpg","credit_id":"549c34a3c3a3682f1b003c4b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1403911,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Herbert Matter","original_name":"Herbert Matter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6683105656b07a36751e4e28","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2124993,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John La Touche","original_name":"John La Touche","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6683103cc6d339e3811b79aa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0122321","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1624,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d2wmZ03XjwqJFxkQgtq7IEYXuc6.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1624,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lQOHtTRxd4jPGLKZQyO7nm2GEAE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1624,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/igBpcgD5oPI28rZE5oZU9SvMgel.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2679,"name":"artist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1950-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
