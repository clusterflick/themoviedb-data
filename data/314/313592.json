So how do we turn a pile of broken bones into a dinosaur exhibit? Dr Alice Roberts finds out how the experts put skeletons back together, with muscles, accurate postures, and even - in some cases - the correct skin color. Here's a conundrum. Most dinosaur skeletons are incomplete, so how do you create museum exhibits that are realistic? As Dr Alice Roberts discovers, it's a practical question for those putting together an exhibition at LA County's Natural History Museum, who have to design dynamic, punter-pleasing displays that also reflect the latest thinking in paleontology circles.","popularity":0.6546,"poster_path":"/nY9sFLgpnB4L2hQOwS7izrRBLPk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How to Build a Dinosaur","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1106221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Roberts","original_name":"Alice Roberts","popularity":0.2803,"profile_path":"/4ZRhDueGV0DcWNoKAipg1AAnGPG.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Herself - Presenter","credit_id":"549b357d925141312900231c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1357807,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olly Bootle","original_name":"Olly Bootle","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"549b35f49251413129002327","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1357807,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olly Bootle","original_name":"Olly Bootle","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c45b56e9251410e0e4e408d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1251308,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jonathan Renouf","original_name":"Jonathan Renouf","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/eTKluwvipvlemR5kPBKHRWyg2AT.jpg","credit_id":"5c45b5879251410e224e4c12","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2066893","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2soqdFXAVYYde9uqBo9c5yfptr2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nY9sFLgpnB4L2hQOwS7izrRBLPk.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dhVfyV0oGbQYqyvVVaYttHT7lli.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pxYdLUfMUOgG0GU9W4fPDiwqVej.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dfN4QK8mW6B8WaS9yHxZzuRpOVV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1719,"name":"paleontology"},{"id":12616,"name":"dinosaur"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
