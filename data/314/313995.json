One day Harry catches the glimpse of a chance: the New York mayor has called out for a large contest in view of  the Statue of Liberty’s official opening. However one must be tutored by a «real» magician and he doesn’t have the slightest idea of how to contact one… until his father tells him that the great Tesla is in town!
