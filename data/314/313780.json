It took place on February 15, 1998, at the Compaq Center in Houston, Texas and was presented by Western Union.  It was the first of a series of In Your House events which later became the title of annual pay-per-views, replacing the method at the time of making new names for all events aside from the 'Big Four' (the Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam and the Survivor Series) and King of the Ring. However, because later events did not take place in Texas, it was truncated to No Way Out and would not become a regular feature until 2000.  Shawn Michaels did not appear in the main event as advertised, owing to a severe back injury that resulted in his first retirement after the following month's WrestleMania XIV. He was replaced by Savio Vega.","popularity":0.0289,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"WWF No Way Out Of Texas: In Your House 20","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"R","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
