On the journey, Rena is abducted by Zach Marlin, who takes her to Buck Brent, an outlaw who has sworn vengeance on Jim Newhall, Rena's father, for sending him to jail years before. Ben later poses as an outlaw, joins Brent's band, and takes a hand in rustling the elder Newhall's cattle. On that raid, Ben contrives to get himself captured and convinces Rena's father both of his own good intentions and of the treachery of Marlin. Ben rejoins Brent's gang, but he is soon exposed as a fraud by Marlin.","popularity":0.3398,"poster_path":"/oLBrcKjLc4EtCHJ1beEJyy69RJe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Story of a Humble Lad in the Far West who rose to Fame","title":"The Saddle Hawk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":538370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hoot Gibson","original_name":"Hoot Gibson","popularity":0.5064,"profile_path":"/gtDdTrKTNy26xJVUeJpdFmZvZWf.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ben Johnson","credit_id":"549ea8cd9251414bb2006580","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":927637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marian Nixon","original_name":"Marian Nixon","popularity":0.2212,"profile_path":"/tpddnLH13URNCtcYhEiEDNr32Cm.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Rena Newhall","credit_id":"549ea8fc9251411d53002530","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"G.
