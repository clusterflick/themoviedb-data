The diary portrays Dodd as a scoundrel who fathered a girl by a woman he never married, and Dodd's family as a nest of vipers. Jeanne decides it is her duty to save this corrupt family and presents herself to Dodd as his illegitimate daughter. In fact, Dodd is a meek old man whose scandalous diary was pure fantasy, and the only hostile member of the family is Dodd's greedy brother Jerry, who was the only sympathetic character in Dodd's diary. Jeanne falls in love with Dodd's nephew Kent, though she dutifully urges him to marry Hazel Jenkins, a woman whom Jeanne believes Kent has wronged. A lost film.","popularity":0.1129,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1920-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alias Miss Dodd","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1090777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edith Roberts","original_name":"Edith Roberts","popularity":0.0803,"profile_path":"/gDYOXTWW1WUYsMV7wsaKJBlESYd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jeanne","credit_id":"549c62b4c3a3682f21003ed1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1404031,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Charles J.
