In a laundry room, a washing boiler blows out steam and a washboard and a brush lie in the trough. The two washing tools then come alive - the washboard turns into a laundress and the brush into a man. The two begin dancing together while the brush plays harmonica and sings: \"What a misery in this world, no one fears us any more, we are useless, everybody deserted us.\" The washboard and the brush die, and the trough serves them as a coffin. There appears a sign \"Here rest the scrubbing brush and the washboard\", followed by a view of a box of Šotek Hellada [Goblin Hellada] washing powder, the musical score to the song \"This is our Goblin, washing with Goblin is just playing\" and the Hellada trademark.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":271431,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reklama-Slavia Praha","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"}],"release_date":"1933-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nobody Likes Us Any More...","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5675174,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"František Muzika","original_name":"František Muzika","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bcba735107ff83b51bc2de","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1651123,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jaroslav Křička","original_name":"Jaroslav Křička","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bcbaa044cde0e5841f4d4a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1933-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
