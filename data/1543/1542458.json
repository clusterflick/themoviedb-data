Through quick cuts and sudden shifts, Devereaux creates a collage of ready-made visual moments—buildings, signs, shadows, and chance alignments glimpsed in passing. The film operates as both a study of three-dimensional space and a meditation on the eye’s ability to seize upon images in a split second. Color, light, and shadow flicker across the frame, transforming the city into a shifting field of accidental design.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ykd4vys6RE3epKXD2WzMwuIN5bX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rush Light","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5640861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Devereaux","original_name":"Max Devereaux","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/fpagARmQKYPgYMxZVDglUlwhtY5.jpg","credit_id":"68bc739238ae4bfab51f4cff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eXVnCQG9wVr5GVxMOs9nf4CdsUJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ykd4vys6RE3epKXD2WzMwuIN5bX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1418,"name":"skyscraper"},{"id":3760,"name":"light"},{"id":6024,"name":"sculpture"},{"id":10629,"name":"vision"},{"id":10616,"name":"urban"},{"id":12436,"name":"architecture"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":190464,"name":"downtown"},{"id":252768,"name":"minneapolis"},{"id":282997,"name":"city"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"},{"id":358468,"name":"found objects"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jt5Ivx6Xp4&t=1s","release_date":"2025-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Rush Light (2025) Max Devereaux Short Film","key":"7Jt5Ivx6Xp4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2025-08-25T04:33:07.000Z","id":"68bc731df77921dc4598bb85"}]}}}
