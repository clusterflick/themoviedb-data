One day, the writer Eliott Walker makes a visit to Global Studios, a major cinema company. He is the author of \"Triumphal Song of Youth\", the best-seller which swept over the jazz age to become the representative novel of the 1920s. He received millions of dollars in royalties for this novel which was based on the story of his wife, but he squandered it all. As a result his wife had a nervous breakdown and was admitted to hospital, leading Eliott to indulge in drinking. Now, Eliott is forgotten.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/j1SPzdp5s6sf60ix0tmbxciQw2x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hollywood Babylon ~The Paradise Lost~","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":127897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miki Maya","original_name":"真矢ミキ","popularity":0.666,"profile_path":"/zHtMF0r04lD5r2JnYYkkh6W7s6Y.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Arthur Cochran","credit_id":"68bb6f7cb4b3bbb73b9bba65","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5507126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sen Hosachi","original_name":"Sen Hosachi","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Lia Montes","credit_id":"68bb6f89c7cfcca8619bbc04","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1403097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mire Aika","original_name":"愛華みれ","popularity":0.0904,"profile_path":"/5e9FWm0SAcq5Z1w0FKIZGBJSqva.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Eliott Walker","credit_id":"68bb6f900502aac347946d50","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3386103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kouju Tatsuki","original_name":"Kouju Tatsuki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/nv8sVMejoKsPckXz0sJlQTaOiDK.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lesley Schwartz","credit_id":"68bb6fa366584852359bba6e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2178277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hibiki Takumi","original_name":"匠ひびき","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/xtP1u1kSMJc8Quh4DBaxSBNCLHd.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mario de Luca","credit_id":"68bb6fb04935e5d1e31bbe3c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2419919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aki Nagisa","original_name":"Aki Nagisa","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":"/oXnCwk8epllREjtmj14SGIA3Hvo.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Pola Daniels","credit_id":"68bb6fba66584852359bba71","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2763671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sumire Haruno","original_name":"春野寿美礼","popularity":1.1162,"profile_path":"/2UApdwMbqp7VnWfkhHLtXWG5Akb.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Peter Hunt","credit_id":"68bb70434e058dc0fe9bfbaa","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2425405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jun Sena","original_name":"瀬奈じゅん","popularity":0.1508,"profile_path":"/p7BzfdNTbzpRXZYvTtbIi0slCCE.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Jim","credit_id":"68bb7062450c5c74fd1bbd76","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1928431,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shuichiro Koike","original_name":"小池修一郎","popularity":1.377,"profile_path":"/quRN5vwtnCtEQSJlC3jNoW07qwp.jpg","credit_id":"68bb707cb5e9c25e5798b546","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1928431,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shuichiro Koike","original_name":"小池修一郎","popularity":1.377,"profile_path":"/quRN5vwtnCtEQSJlC3jNoW07qwp.jpg","credit_id":"68bb7083db06f191e69bfc77","department":"Writing","job":"Author"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2446092,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Shou Sumire","original_name":"Shou Sumire","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bb7090bdb8f736629bbd73","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2446091,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Hayama Kiyomi","original_name":"Hayama Kiyomi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bb709bb26a06207e0695ab","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j1SPzdp5s6sf60ix0tmbxciQw2x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1997-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
