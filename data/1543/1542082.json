But one particular story thread — which plays out in the pages of Richard Osman’s novel — didn’t make it to the final cut. Watch officer De Freitas (Naomi Ackie) break through a major part of the case, meet a character played by Emmy nominee Sarah Niles, and see what secrets local priest Father Mackie (Joseph Marcell) is keeping from the crime-solving crew. As a thank you for making The Thursday Murder Club film such a success, Osman tells Tudum that “the brilliant Chris Columbus wanted to share a scene that didn’t make it into the final cut, but one he really loved. This is for all you Father Mackie fans out there!” The Thursday Murder Club is now streaming on Netflix.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/aBaGfkah54OB3orNFAmgUdUSjW5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Priest Who Wasn’t a Priest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1481,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aBaGfkah54OB3orNFAmgUdUSjW5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
