She cannot get rid of the dirt in the form of little black devils who cheerily romp on the laundry. A white deer rushes to help her, giving her a bar of Schicht's soap with the deer. The animated, revived bar of soap then disarms all the devils and the laundry is white again.\r The commercial for the Czechoslovak-based Schicht company (Jiří Schicht a. s.) was filmed abroad.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":263622,"logo_path":null,"name":"Excentric-Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":271430,"logo_path":null,"name":"Schicht Ústí nad Labem","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"}],"release_date":"1932-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Deer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Der Weisse Hirsch","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1932-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
