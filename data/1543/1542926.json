Raised at Catalonia but coming from Ethiopia, Beruh Pietx Prat thinks about her childhood and the memory lapses leaved by the shortage of information about her biological mother. Together with her sister Eskedar, they create an imaginary figure of their mother, weaving knowledge from their adoptive mother to fill the holes. Using a mixture of Super 8 and digital footage, the movie merges real and imagined worlds through living colors, textures and figures. The heart of the narrative is the exploration of the physical resemblance of the sisters with her biological mother, the only tangible bond that they have left of her. Through this personal trip, the movie stands out the universal emotions of family, memory and identity, totally embracing the complexities of adoption and cultural roots.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/sI6DPnEcBk2CiRgQ65VHwtoQySC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":241774,"logo_path":null,"name":"The National Film School at
