Where the original moved fluidly along the wavering asphalt lines, this version interrupts and joltsâ€”images are thrown at the viewer in abrupt succession rather than unfolding in smooth sequence. At irregular moments the progression halts, pausing briefly to give the eye a fleeting chance to study a composition before the next cut arrives. Silent and stripped down, the film turns the repaired surface into a volatile field of inscription, where repair becomes staccato mark-making and perception itself is fractured into sudden bursts of line and form.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/2BTJNdubUxf7rffrX2FY6NvX2FB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Introduction to Crack Sealing 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5640861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Devereaux","original_name":"Max Devereaux","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/fpagARmQKYPgYMxZVDglUlwhtY5.jpg","credit_id":"68bc0eb7344b8fee0d98ba5c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fT3WqL4JCQfcjjPzlfXf6wwo8Bc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2BTJNdubUxf7rffrX2FY6NvX2FB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":33496,"name":"construction"},{"id":358456,"name":"pavement"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUgs2YDrLWQ","release_date":"2023-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Introduction to Crack Sealing 2 (2022) Max Devereaux Short Film","key":"uUgs2YDrLWQ","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2023-01-20T21:33:53.000Z","id":"68bc0e2d479a832295946f33"}]}}}
