The spider transforms into a bird, which changes its head and performs a flying motion from the center of the screen to the lower left corner, where its shape degrades and recomposes itself into the shape of another bird, which flies toward the right side of the frame. The word “end” gradually appears, formed by small, discontinuous strokes. While writing the letter M, a hand holding a pen appears, writing. The small strokes are transformed into continuous letters, and the last movement is the transformation of the letter I into a stick figure waving, accompanied by a speech bubble containing the word “end” again.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/yj2BSFAS3qoDmUY7mh5aGnHHo5G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":273412,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinemateca do Museu Guido Viaro","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1976-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aranhol","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5674693,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Álvaro Borges Júnior","original_name":"Álvaro Borges Júnior","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bc86a8de6563fdec8ceb5c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yj2BSFAS3qoDmUY7mh5aGnHHo5G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"Festival de Gramado","release_date":"1976-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
