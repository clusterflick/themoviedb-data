Like Alice from Lewis Carroll’s novel, who maintains her position as observer and tries to understand the functioning of a world which is alien, here the protagonist plays the role of spectator, exactly as the viewers in the exhibition – strangers from another world. The work also investigates the idea of timelessness, as usual in von Brandenburg’s practice, which – as the artist herself has stated – attempts “to situate the action out of time and play with different epochs”.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Straße","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5097071,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulla von Brandenburg","original_name":"Ulla von Brandenburg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bc375a934c154ceb8ce9ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
