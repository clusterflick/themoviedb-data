Devereauxâ€™s camera follows the wavering lines, skipping from one to another, turning the utilitarian marks of maintenance into strokes of abstract drawing. Silent and pared down, the film reframes the parking lot as a field of accidental composition, where repair becomes inscription and the act of seeing becomes a study of gesture itself.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4FT7f2VyvIzxyYSdcQlb64ISWlC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Introduction to Crack Sealing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5640861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Devereaux","original_name":"Max Devereaux","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/fpagARmQKYPgYMxZVDglUlwhtY5.jpg","credit_id":"68bb60e6adad6c15461f4b54","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6c4B30EiaGHzEjgDzSDro2E9bow.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4FT7f2VyvIzxyYSdcQlb64ISWlC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4826,"name":"repair"},{"id":15334,"name":"parking lot"},{"id":33496,"name":"construction"},{"id":215785,"name":"gesture"},{"id":315135,"name":"rhythm"},{"id":358434,"name":"crack sealing"},{"id":358435,"name":"abstraction"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw1s50z0WvE&t=25s","release_date":"2023-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Introduction to Crack Sealing (2022) Max Devereaux Short Film","key":"Aw1s50z0WvE","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2023-01-20T21:30:53.000Z","id":"68bb609f21a023df8a9bff05"}]}}}
