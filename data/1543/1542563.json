Another baby rises up from a nearby pram, pulls off their dirty diapers and sets off for a ride through the streets in its own vehicle. It first snatches dirty laundry from the gossiping housewives and the curtains from the open windows, rushing with the armful of laundry to a billboard, which displays Schicht's washing and soaking detergents. There, it uses the help of a commercial mascot to demonstrate how to soak laundry in The Housewife's Praise and how to wash it in Schichtal powder.\r The commercial for the Czechoslovak-based Schicht company (Jiří Schicht a. s.) was filmed abroad.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":263622,"logo_path":null,"name":"Excentric-Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":271433,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lintas Vídeň","origin_country":""},{"id":271430,"logo_path":null,"name":"Schicht Ústí nad Labem","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1932-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Johnnie Loves It Clean","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5675156,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"lintas","original_name":"lintas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bcb73425f494771c4e5f38","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1932-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
