Amokian’s footage of modified CRT televisions generating unruly abstractions is layered with Devereaux’s processed iPhone videos, altered through datamoshing and glitch-editing apps. The result is a vivid collision of sound and image—a colorful flux of patterns and distortions where technology’s failures become raw material for improvisation.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/spp9jlsKHxkdiphLOBa0KDlci7s.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MD+IA=?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5640861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Devereaux","original_name":"Max Devereaux","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/fpagARmQKYPgYMxZVDglUlwhtY5.jpg","credit_id":"68bca5f7122c836fc74e5b84","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5675000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Igor Amokian","original_name":"Igor Amokian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bca608bce7b2a2989c00d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5640861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Devereaux","original_name":"Max Devereaux","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/fpagARmQKYPgYMxZVDglUlwhtY5.jpg","credit_id":"68bca6b4572c69d92498bb02","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5675000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Igor Amokian","original_name":"Igor Amokian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bca6c7a04c22fb97947264","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jHSznRMW4Bfhwm7BmNluogwZU97.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/spp9jlsKHxkdiphLOBa0KDlci7s.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":185861,"name":"glitch"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"},{"id":287038,"name":"pattern"},{"id":343507,"name":"sound art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAI0yCoVn7U","release_date":"2023-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"MD+IA=?
