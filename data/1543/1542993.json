After a young Haitian boy, Ducan, crosses a border river into the Dominican Republic to retrieve his father's hard-earned money from a farm, he bumps into a very timid boy named Elias. Even though hostile at first, Elias grows to understand the boy's circumstances and agrees to show Ducan the way. After encountering numerous risks, such as hometown bullies and even guards, they develop a sense of care and look out for one another. Once the sun sets and they've retrieved their money, they say their farewells. They know that this goodbye will not be forever. It only takes one person and a day for your whole life to change forever.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The River Between Us","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DO","title":"El Río Entre Nosotros","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5676772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Ramirez","original_name":"Francis Ramirez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Elias","credit_id":"68bdf0ccc7cfcca8619bc585","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5676773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernardo Celestino","original_name":"Bernardo Celestino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Ducan","credit_id":"68bdf0d9b26a06207e06a0de","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5676746,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophia Lafaurie-Muñoz","original_name":"Sophia Lafaurie-Muñoz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bded4a538501451b4e6124","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5676750,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alex Miranda","original_name":"Alex Miranda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bded7846a23182a29c05ba","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5676752,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Myra Soto","original_name":"Myra Soto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bded879c3fe8147d1f50d7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5676774,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Emelin Vivar","original_name":"Emelin Vivar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bdf0e974c5e036819c05fa","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5676775,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Xochilt Garcia","original_name":"Xochilt Garcia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bdf0f488213c5ba71bc99e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5676776,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Diego Medina","original_name":"Diego Medina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bdf10f538501451b4e6145","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2248048,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Avila Santo","original_name":"Avila Santo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bdf124efa96fc7f71f565d","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37995886","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4932,"name":"farm"},{"id":1261,"name":"river"},{"id":2286,"name":"border"},{"id":3230,"name":"male friendship"},{"id":10683,"name":"coming of age"},{"id":156154,"name":"haitian"},{"id":197525,"name":"dominican"},{"id":355408,"name":"bullies"},{"id":358513,"name":"dominican haitian relations"},{"id":358514,"name":"guards"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"2024 Ghetto Film School LA International Thesis Films","release_date":"2024-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"NewFilmmakers Los Angeles (NFMLA) | InFocus: Latin & Hispanic Cinema","release_date":"2025-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"National Film Festival for Talented Youth (NFFTY)","release_date":"2025-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"Nou Akoma Nou Sinèrji Haitian Dominican Transnational Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"Nou Akoma Nou Sinèrji Haitian Dominican Transnational Film Festival","release_date":"2025-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
