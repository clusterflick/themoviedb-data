He had spent some forty years of his life studying the Mont Blanc massif, sacrificing a good part of his fortune to this multifaceted passion. He was notably the first to demonstrate that one could sleep, work and even do science at an altitude of over 4000 meters, at a time when ascents to the summit of Western Europe were still adventurous expeditions. This documentary tribute follows in his footsteps, via the route taken at the time, on foot from Chamonix via the Grands Mulets refuge to the summit of Mont Blanc to the Joseph Vallot observatory nestled at an altitude of 4400m, with a team of guides, journalists and scientists.","popularity":0.1214,"poster_path":"/xSLfHRlAYqJhJGsXadYWlivjtiI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":261732,"logo_path":"/8Vy2sJ0rm7yaLFQvhIByQpaAro3.png","name":"Compagnie des Guides de Chamonix","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2025-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Lumières de Vallot","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","title":"أضواء فالوت","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3834207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Vallot","original_name":"Joseph Vallot","popularity":0.0993,"profile_path":"/32VU02lLZ78NfE6TEIO46XAwc9V.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"68bc5d8ff4fc744e5198b6cb","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1403871,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bertrand Delapierre","original_name":"Bertrand Delapierre","popularity":0.0976,"profile_path":"/hyBFTuWSpmGVjeRAyr1ANj7tIhP.jpg","credit_id":"68bc5d2a0502aac347947269","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1403871,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bertrand Delapierre","original_name":"Bertrand Delapierre","popularity":0.0976,"profile_path":"/hyBFTuWSpmGVjeRAyr1ANj7tIhP.jpg","credit_id":"68bc5d303bf2b908bf8ce8f7","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5674245,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eliane Patriarca","original_name":"Eliane Patriarca","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bc5d623c2b162ba21f4c61","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1403871,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bertrand Delapierre","original_name":"Bertrand Delapierre","popularity":0.0976,"profile_path":"/hyBFTuWSpmGVjeRAyr1ANj7tIhP.jpg","credit_id":"68bc5d6af4fc744e5198b6c5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3370987,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Laurent Mollard","original_name":"Laurent Mollard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bc5d74b5e9c25e5798b82b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt38170404","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5ilgx5Oe48bcFa5ARTasnPr3oA2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1922,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xSLfHRlAYqJhJGsXadYWlivjtiI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":192940,"name":"geography"},{"id":215368,"name":"chamonix"},{"id":316221,"name":"lodève, france"},{"id":347026,"name":"mont-blanc mountains range"},{"id":349939,"name":"mountaineering documentary film"},{"id":358465,"name":"mountain scientist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
