As the ferns’ leaves are pale in dark  surroundings, the tinted positive yields green leaves in a black background, and the toned negative  green leaves in a white background. Excerpts from Schubert’s Schoene Muellerin lament and laud  the colour green by turns.”","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dear/Dread","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1341191,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Tuohy","original_name":"Richard Tuohy","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/e9fRAraxpGPCFnWEU3zw4CAqXFB.jpg","credit_id":"68bc4999dc9395075f8ce876","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
