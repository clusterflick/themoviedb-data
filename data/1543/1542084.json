Inspired by Annie Sprinkle’s playful merging of pleasure and performance in Sluts and Goddesses Video Workshop (1992), Ron Athey’s radical bodily extremes in The Judas Cradle (2004), and well as Florentina Holzinger's landmark staging of Sancta (2024), she pushes classical opera into queer, post-porn territory. Using 90s DIY video aesthetics and embodied impact, this project reclaims and queers a controversial aria through empowered kink.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/djYW6BemtClcSTXQfS6uXULVWlG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Batti, batti","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5670971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophia Zuzga","original_name":"Sophia Zuzga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Zerlina","credit_id":"68bb69349f524398508ce688","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5670975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liana Rostamian","original_name":"Liana Rostamian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Masetto","credit_id":"68bb6943b4b474000c1f4aa7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5673255,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Annice Cecil","original_name":"Annice Cecil","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bb68e4b5e9c25e5798b501","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5128294,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jay Shepherd","original_name":"Jay Shepherd","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bb68f9344b8fee0d98b79f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/djYW6BemtClcSTXQfS6uXULVWlG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2025-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
