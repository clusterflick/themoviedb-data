Filled with questions about what it means to “not end up alone,” Tatiana explores her grandma Teresa’s life: an imposing woman who owned an iconic movie theater, divorced three times and challenged the Dominican social norms of her era. The filmmaker embarks on a journey through family archives, old films and hundreds of letters, constructing —or trying to deconstruct— a story about love, expectations and solitude.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/nk7COZyZHBq4Jjtf3KUHpBr31cS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":273416,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cine Carmelita","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DO","name":"Dominican Republic"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Questioning what it means to “not end up alone,” a single 40-year-old filmmaker explores the life of her grandmother, who challenged her era’s social norms.","title":"I am my Grandma's Granddaughter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2427585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lia Briones","original_name":"Lia Briones","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Teresa Pichardo (voice)","credit_id":"68bc8e5c3881eb5887947185","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1738413,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tatiana Fernandez Geara","original_name":"Tatiana Fernandez Geara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"68bc8e79572c69d92498babe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5674816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cesar Fernandez","original_name":"Cesar Fernandez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"68bc8e9934f75d1e3e98ba20","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5674819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Soeren Henn","original_name":"Soeren Henn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"68bc8ea57618bd35c11bc3fc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5674820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teresina Fernandez","original_name":"Teresina Fernandez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"68bc8eb1f896fc684b4e5aaa","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5674822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enzo Pessa","original_name":"Enzo Pessa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"68bc8ebce823ec1c8c9c002e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5674825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mirna Forabosco","original_name":"Mirna Forabosco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"68bc8ee004dd0798a5069e0a","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1738413,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tatiana Fernandez Geara","original_name":"Tatiana Fernandez Geara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bc8f4474c5e036819c01d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2039387,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wendy Espinal","original_name":"Wendy Espinal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bc8f56e5b0c6eb7d947403","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1738413,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tatiana Fernandez Geara","original_name":"Tatiana Fernandez Geara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bc8f70f23d3e3203947326","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3147205,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gina Giudicelli","original_name":"Gina Giudicelli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bc8f8474c5e036819c01d4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36048603","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/nk7COZyZHBq4Jjtf3KUHpBr31cS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3371,"name":"family history"},{"id":210589,"name":"searching for love"},{"id":222228,"name":"cinema history"},{"id":238302,"name":"past love"},{"id":254696,"name":"womenhood"},{"id":347236,"name":"midlife coming-of-age"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
