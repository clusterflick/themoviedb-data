Since the production of the documentary, however, things have changed, not necessarily for the worst. (it could even be the subject for a documentary itself): in some of the villages (formerly) inhabited by the Deutschböhmen, people from Timisoara built their holiday houses, Weidenthal (which is featured in the docu - the Romanian name is Brebu Nou) and Wolfsberg (Garâna) are not completely deserted, the mayor of Garâna (might be known to some Romanians for the Jazz Festival there) is actually of German origin.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Like a Bird on the Fence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","title":"Ca o pasăre pe gard","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1136128,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Ciulei","original_name":"Thomas Ciulei","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68bd5dadb70c82581b9c02e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
