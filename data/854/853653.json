Like people, chimps are fascinated by television. But until Apes as Family, no filmmaker had made a film to appeal to two ape species. This film contains all the primate dramas-around sex, food, territory, and politics. The movie follows an urban chimp into her home and what happens when she meets a bunch of wild strangers. The chimpanzees watching on televisions installed at the Edinburgh Zoo were a curious, and at times, rowdy bunch.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Primate Cinema: Apes as Family","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3169734,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denise Pearlman","original_name":"Denise Pearlman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Carla","credit_id":"60fb936efb3f61002f460880","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3169735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Song Man Choh","original_name":"Song Man Choh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Male Chimp","credit_id":"60fb938299d5c3007f0ed516","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3169741,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dawn Meyer","original_name":"Dawn Meyer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Female Chimp","credit_id":"60fb941f1684f7007fd38f8a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3169742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.C.
