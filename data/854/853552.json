Helene Ford has been injected with heroin by an unscrupulous physician, causing her to act irrationally. Her husband Stephen, a noted artist, hires a model whom Helene, inflamed by their friend Jack Murray, suspects of having an affair with Stephen. The model is also addicted to drugs and convinces Stephen to try heroin to forget his troubles. Both Stephen and Helene then become addicted to drugs. They abandon their home and then separate, after which Stephen resorts to crime to support his heroin addiction. During an escape from the police after a robbery, Stephen encounters Helene again, this time near death. She sacrifices her own life to shield her husband, but Stephen and his former model plunge to their deaths.","popularity":0.2652,"poster_path":"/hpwF5UHTag6tw2fwVNhsGKSSUeq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157852,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kinetophote","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Spirit of the Poppy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2687155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward MacKay","original_name":"Edward MacKay","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Stephen Ford","credit_id":"60fb11a4a12856005e5262bd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3169253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edith Luckett","original_name":"Edith Luckett","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/uhPCVZ5oP9bSWt002OgDX7l2Yl1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Helene Ford","credit_id":"60fb1177944a570030432ee0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3169256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Rose","original_name":"Anna Rose","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Blanche","credit_id":"60fb120df29d66005d2a00d9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William R.
