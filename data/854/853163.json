In this slapstick adaptation of the story, there are plenty of laughs as well as some criticism of current mores. The director, Bill Zebub, realized that the real-life events seemed comical, like when police actually returned an escaped victim to the killer. As silly as that sounds, the reasons for the law enforcement blunders was because of prejudice, which isn't funny. A person in authority should not act on personal bias.","popularity":0.0817,"poster_path":"/fkaD3z8mU3fBPNglnf1Lu976UfN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20952,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bill Zebub Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dumb & Dahmer","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Dumb and Dahmer","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2391806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Misty Lovelace","original_name":"Misty Lovelace","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/bQav7960JY6XTSmqnZdHVmoKGq7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Kelly","credit_id":"61eee6ffdf2945006876ac24","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3396179,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peelmanm Michael","original_name":"Peelmanm Michael","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mike","credit_id":"61eee70dcedac400dfef4d27","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Zebub","original_name":"Bill Zebub","popularity":0.2551,"profile_path":"/bhZNgeH9PbnxFCsKeOZEzBVewQ1.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Jeffrey","credit_id":"63394f2f41a561007d550a50","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Zebub","original_name":"Bill Zebub","popularity":0.2551,"profile_path":"/bhZNgeH9PbnxFCsKeOZEzBVewQ1.jpg","credit_id":"60f9ad1be24b93002e376327","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Zebub","original_name":"Bill Zebub","popularity":0.2551,"profile_path":"/bhZNgeH9PbnxFCsKeOZEzBVewQ1.jpg","credit_id":"61eee7240284200094538299","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Zebub","original_name":"Bill Zebub","popularity":0.2551,"profile_path":"/bhZNgeH9PbnxFCsKeOZEzBVewQ1.jpg","credit_id":"61eee72bea37e0496d185603","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Zebub","original_name":"Bill Zebub","popularity":0.2551,"profile_path":"/bhZNgeH9PbnxFCsKeOZEzBVewQ1.jpg","credit_id":"61eee7199e458600d91ad020","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14024862","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fkaD3z8mU3fBPNglnf1Lu976UfN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9253,"name":"slapstick comedy"},{"id":10714,"name":"serial killer"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
