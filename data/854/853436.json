Part of the annexed territories was also the small municipality of Elten. While the people of Elten were initially afraid of the occupation, the time “with Holland” actually became a miracle of prosperity and economy about which many people from Elten still rave today. The occupation period ended with the largest organized smuggling in the history of the federal republic of Germany. The Documentary shows this in never before released 8 mm footage!","popularity":1.3233,"poster_path":"/tP9NYmOAgjS2O0DrBet0szSCxwf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8197,"logo_path":"/614xBoHyCqgiCK8qbGZXreholvh.png","name":"Beetz Brothers Film
