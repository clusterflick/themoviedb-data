What begins as a wholesome weekend getaway quickly goes from bad to worse. Little do they know that amidst their tomfoolery, a bloodthirsty cult of territorial creatures has arisen from the shadows surrounding the cabin. It's up to Mike (Cole Stevenson) to save his girlfriend, Jamie (Laura Reinertson), his brother, Jeff (Nick Koscik), and his rag-tag team of friends from certain doom. The question is, can he rise to the challenge? It's a vacation straight from the depths of hell. And in order to find salvation, they'll have no choice but to go beyond the darkness.","popularity":0.265,"poster_path":"/2MEWalvjJydNhLh4YENPfOhfx0V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157883,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmsauce Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2014-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Strange things lie beyond the darkness...","title":"Beyond the Darkness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3169898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Reintertson","original_name":"Laura Reintertson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Jamie","credit_id":"60fbc215d6c300002c618e96","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3169899,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cole Stevenson","original_name":"Cole Stevenson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mike","credit_id":"60fbc2291684f70046c0b025","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2467893,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nicholas Koscik","original_name":"Nicholas Koscik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jeff","credit_id":"60fbc250f29d660046a9d43e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3058371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Milton","original_name":"Tom Milton","popularity":0.0867,"profile_path":"/eLNunaBnLWEQommLs6ZJfgTLqCa.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Peter","credit_id":"60fbc2b099d5c3005fefc9a0","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3169903,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Young","original_name":"Nick Young","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60fbc342e24b930048f3ba61","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3169903,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Young","original_name":"Nick Young","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60fbc425e24b93005f9f9118","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3169903,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Young","original_name":"Nick Young","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60fbc3153d3557002d516bd1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3169903,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Young","original_name":"Nick Young","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60fbc3063d355700472336c3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2467893,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nicholas Koscik","original_name":"Nicholas Koscik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60fbc3f33d3557004723377e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3169903,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Young","original_name":"Nick Young","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60fbc2f999d5c30047e98364","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4560754","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":954,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2MEWalvjJydNhLh4YENPfOhfx0V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":636}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"(New Liskeard) (premiere)","release_date":"2014-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
