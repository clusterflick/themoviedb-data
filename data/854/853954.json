Ernesto and Yisela have moved to the capital, leaving behind their respective hometowns on the borders of Brazil and Argentina. After many years of composing songs that reflect their origins, both decide to explore new horizons and each seeks to fulfill the dream of recording a first album. While Yisela struggles to reconcile the emerging possibilities of a career in Uruguay with her plans to move to Argentina, Ernesto confronts personal conflicts that threaten to sabotage his creative passion. The film fuses the arts of documentary film and music, interweaving the songs and stories of these two young composers. With vérité cinematography and an unforgettable soundtrack, Birds of Passage explores the challenges of being a young artist, and the art of searching, inside and outside of oneself.","popularity":0.0739,"poster_path":"/bHoZjPkpRC2uGAe2gSGbgzc8bIE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157939,"logo_path":null,"name":"Honeycomb Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":138071,"logo_path":null,"name":"Origami Cine","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2009-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Maybe it doesn't matter where the road takes us","title":"Birds of Passage","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3170965,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernesto Díaz","original_name":"Ernesto Díaz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60fcceafdf857c00484c98fd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3170966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yisela Sosa","original_name":"Yisela Sosa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60fccebd1684f7005f066654","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1387584,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rachel Lears","original_name":"Rachel Lears","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/l1ogCR49F9RctE0dbtsYKb8uJsG.jpg","credit_id":"60fcced8df857c007fa08fed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1387584,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rachel Lears","original_name":"Rachel Lears","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/l1ogCR49F9RctE0dbtsYKb8uJsG.jpg","credit_id":"60fccee15ab81a002a4f21c8","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1387584,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rachel Lears","original_name":"Rachel Lears","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/l1ogCR49F9RctE0dbtsYKb8uJsG.jpg","credit_id":"60fccef2e24b93002e3cdfb3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1387584,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rachel Lears","original_name":"Rachel Lears","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/l1ogCR49F9RctE0dbtsYKb8uJsG.jpg","credit_id":"60fccf0af8595800271939d0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1387584,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rachel Lears","original_name":"Rachel Lears","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/l1ogCR49F9RctE0dbtsYKb8uJsG.jpg","credit_id":"60fccf138e8d30005d489f7b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2238992,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Martin Ubillos","original_name":"Martin Ubillos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60fccf23310325002374dbbd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3170965,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernesto Díaz","original_name":"Ernesto Díaz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60fccf361684f7007fd5af9f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3170966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yisela Sosa","original_name":"Yisela Sosa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60fccf42848eb90086734adf","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3170967,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Raul Barcelona","original_name":"Raul Barcelona","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60fccf55f29d66002de018e4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1607249,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Yafalián","original_name":"Daniel Yafalián","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/9sT6KdnxVX2IsepTqpfdQRqwVXC.jpg","credit_id":"60fccf68c439c0005c346d9c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Post Production Coordinator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2799350","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"aves.depaso.3","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.785,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zxIEiltwWfTCpIJNb0b4yYkwScj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1285}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bHoZjPkpRC2uGAe2gSGbgzc8bIE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":637}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2009-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Birds of Passage - PREVIEW","key":"tNR2hhw9chw","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2010-03-16T19:07:31.000Z","id":"60fcd0e2d7fbda0079f873d6"}]}}}
