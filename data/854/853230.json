His apprehensive feelings suddenly reach a new high when he discovers that his old high school crush, the one that got away, is now acting in the adult entertainment industry. Pete is suddenly struck with an insatiable desire to find his long lost love and free her from the negative and destructive lifestyle she has found herself consumed within.
