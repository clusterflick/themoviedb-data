The film shows the life and works of Polish poet Cyprian Kamil Norwid, and offers a great introduction to his legacy ahead of the bicentennial of his birth in September 2021.  The Brothers Quay say: ‘We took the challenge to make this film for an audience who will have probably never ever heard of Norwid; however, in the briefness of this film, we had hoped that we could still ignite the gentle curiosity of the imagination of the viewer towards the legacy that this man left in writing and in art that was simply never validated in his lifetime’.","popularity":0.0863,"poster_path":"/xqA8NqOCTY4XHuAG2rxdRw3kWZz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"VadeMecum","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Vade-mecum","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124237,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Quay","original_name":"Stephen Quay","popularity":0.1806,"profile_path":"/9Z8YMbCDR1xzNwfXdq2IQyUjnHy.jpg","credit_id":"60fa53eb3d3557004720f2da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124238,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Timothy Quay","original_name":"Timothy Quay","popularity":0.086,"profile_path":"/8hGRmypiLEoj4fYGa55kcq01z5s.jpg","credit_id":"60fa54112afb25002ce7fda2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1242,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xqA8NqOCTY4XHuAG2rxdRw3kWZz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":828},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2HrmCeblGst3BzosFZ0nShSFrdN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
