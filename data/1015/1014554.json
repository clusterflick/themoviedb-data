Afterwards he feels guilty about it, and goes to see a lawyer for advice on what to do. The lawyer gives him a speech about how disrespect for the law can lead to even worse crimes than stealing. After Kent shows the proper amount of contrition, the lawyer cuts a deal with the lumber company to have Kent work off the value of the wood he stole, teaching Kent a valuable lesson: while all that high-falutin' talk about respect for the law may be important, having the money to afford a slick lawyer who can keep you out of jail is much more important.","popularity":0.0468,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":20948,"logo_path":null,"name":"Coronet Instructional Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1950-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Why We Respect the Law","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1086360,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gil Altschul","original_name":"Gil Altschul","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ffd8a533a3760082358ceb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0258314","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1950-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
