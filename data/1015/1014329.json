Acting like a total stranger in the city who does not speak or hear the language, he walks with a camera to such sight-seeing spots as Times Square,and the top of the Empire State building, etc., only listening to himself speaking the words: \"I hear myself at the same time that I speak\" in two languages: Japanese and English.
