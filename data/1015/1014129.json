This short film presents a delightful portrait of a young boy's sojourn at summer camp. In idyllic mid-century fashion, two weeks at a Muskoka summer camp are presented as a welcome respite from the congestion of an urban area. From the preliminary scramble for the upper bunk in the cabin to exploring in the woods, cooking food over a fire, and—most exciting of all—passing the beginner's swimming test, Roger's camp adventures are full of joy, camaraderie, and learning.","popularity":0.0684,"poster_path":"/86jhEE6ojvGycklKCRAya1hFe5n.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1949-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Summer Is for Kids","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1236153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Drainie","original_name":"John Drainie","popularity":0.1109,"profile_path":"/oHTlp7J0I7uQzGq5AJWwePXgBsM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narration (voice)","credit_id":"62fe6bdae559370093bcb44d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":969626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stanley Jackson","original_name":"Stanley Jackson","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62fe6bc0963864007e83fe36","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57293,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Sydney Newman","original_name":"Sydney Newman","popularity":0.212,"profile_path":"/QKW3Widw7yaemYlB3NKEmJrhrF.jpg","credit_id":"66623cb6836513c1a292e85e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0227585","wikidata_id":"Q123289232","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":1.318,"height":873,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7sp0BiiVjQYy3Qedpy4yOEgolnG.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1151}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/86jhEE6ojvGycklKCRAya1hFe5n.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1949-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
