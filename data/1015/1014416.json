Traditional ways of life eroded, and many families were forced to move away. Drawing on rare 8mm colour film of Berneray, directors Andy MacKinnon and Kirsty MacDonald offer a bridge between the contemporary citizens and their not-so-distant past. The result is a film of great emotion that speaks to the importance of place and the resilience of culture through language, song and memories.","popularity":0.1051,"poster_path":"/kzOMBMWr2HbNPDY3WbAKJO5uq6x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Gaelic","iso_639_1":"gd","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3669136,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Margaret Cameron","original_name":"Margaret Cameron","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ff758df8aee8007a46ee55","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3669128,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Mackinnon","original_name":"Andy Mackinnon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ff750cbbe1dd0082b0ae72","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3669141,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Thomas","original_name":"Mark Thomas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ff75b7dcf8750083b32dd2","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1529014,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Donald Shaw","original_name":"Donald Shaw","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ff75db323eba00853a15fc","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3669132,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kirsty MacDonald","original_name":"Kirsty MacDonald","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ff74f5323eba009da4fcf5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3669128,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Mackinnon","original_name":"Andy Mackinnon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ff747cf8aee80082175740","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3669128,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Mackinnon","original_name":"Andy Mackinnon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ff752685702e007b33b165","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1254158,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Archer","original_name":"John Archer","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ff75585ad76b0097c215b9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kzOMBMWr2HbNPDY3WbAKJO5uq6x.jpg","vote_average":5.238,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"gd","note":"EIFF 2022","release_date":"2022-08-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Dùthchas (Home) | #EIFF22","key":"7J8qHCWtfoE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2022-07-20T09:00:07.000Z","id":"65228d8f74507d00ff9a887d"}]}}}
