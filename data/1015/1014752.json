Before they set out we are introduced to the climbers' basic equipment and learn the uses of rope and ice axe. Excitement mounts as the alpinists leap gaping chasms, inch their way along icy ledges, and drag themselves up what looks like a sheer wall of rock. Arriving breathless at the top, they pause in triumph for a view of the magnificent mountains lying around their vanquished peak.","popularity":0.1911,"poster_path":"/vi5VNGqgatX5n4lJmnsDA90lt8E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1950-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cliff Hangers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorne Greene","original_name":"Lorne Greene","popularity":0.768,"profile_path":"/8thOy0TS7tNDBcwPqjmOPw9Jgdx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Narration (voice)","credit_id":"6300ae601da7a600a4cdeae8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2695755,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Len Chatwin","original_name":"Len Chatwin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64be6a21ac6c7908dd1d9cd2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2721749,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Don Mulholland","original_name":"Don Mulholland","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64be6a0a85c0a2010610c658","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3232112,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marion Meadows","original_name":"Marion Meadows","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64be6a6b58efd300c5ff6746","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1626167,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Robert Fleming","original_name":"Robert Fleming","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64be6a5f85c0a200c898deb7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0241311","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1150,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vi5VNGqgatX5n4lJmnsDA90lt8E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":766}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1950-08-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
