First the ladies visit, the image—a roving camera lovingly viewing a still image—calls up both the progress and stagnancy of their talk, then they go to watch a play—on a television, in a snow garden. In many ways the play references the cadence of the ladies' conversation—the tedious animosity and lack of attentive or appropriate response. I am thinking about the art of conversation, the various directions this art takes and the ways one's receptivity to dialog changes when the subjects creating this dialog are taken out of the equation, or suggested scantily.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"the visit and the play","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1208762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephanie Barber","original_name":"Stephanie Barber","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/2IuOe0ooAUmwLJuAWWBUcvayl4V.jpg","credit_id":"62feea81d6819b007a968bdb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
