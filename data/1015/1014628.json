Polly invests in the stock market and begins to reap rewards, but she is unable to persuade Marie to use her life's savings to buy shares of American Cheese or Brazilian Bananas. Meanwhile, Marie's daughter, Genevieve, and Polly's son, William, just back from college, fall in love; but an argument between the ladies breaks up the romance; and smarting under Polly's patronizing manner, Marie plunges into the market herself and with the winnings is able to stage a society splurge at a fashionable resort.","popularity":0.3554,"poster_path":"/2m50VDVQ0BtD9R86ckUS0xfBZHf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1442,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cosmopolitan Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1930-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Take a tip in the Happiness Market and win a Million in Laughs!","title":"Caught Short","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Dressler","original_name":"Marie Dressler","popularity":0.1524,"profile_path":"/xRsxCFcdo30PKDhRWXlk8Idwljl.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Marie Jones","credit_id":"6300190ddfe31d00800feda4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Polly Moran","original_name":"Polly Moran","popularity":0.2533,"profile_path":"/2lzTBafNt2z9hfbCIoyPJTwVs1y.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Polly Smith","credit_id":"6300191db39e35007f6723e8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita Page","original_name":"Anita Page","popularity":0.3163,"profile_path":"/l8K3xcxGyvXxH3WSU4wwsMrxcWp.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Genevieve Jones","credit_id":"6300192cdfe31d009203f548","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1064925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Morton","original_name":"Charles Morton","popularity":0.1356,"profile_path":"/icutT9OmiHlQK2jITUFdcZ8s1um.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"William Smith","credit_id":"6300193b1c6aa7007a004514","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3670035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Conlin","original_name":"Thomas Conlin","popularity":0.1084,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Frankie","credit_id":"630019515ab81a0085c68904","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1329855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Douglas Haig","original_name":"Douglas Haig","popularity":0.0668,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Johnny","credit_id":"63001960839d93007b627cfc","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2456671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nanci Price","original_name":"Nanci Price","popularity":0.0669,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Priscilla","credit_id":"630019723e6f2b007d271367","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3670037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greta Mann","original_name":"Greta Mann","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Sophy","credit_id":"63001981b39e35007a84c36f","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1004953,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Willard Mack","original_name":"Willard Mack","popularity":0.0972,"profile_path":"/eXm5yWoBI7NmVwGs2GZsyMiWAT4.jpg","credit_id":"630018f27d41aa007e386f4e","department":"Writing","job":"Dialogue"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94180,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Reisner","original_name":"Charles Reisner","popularity":0.1561,"profile_path":"/e3BMvF1x1LuJNvG4iAXdHsY8EUR.jpg","credit_id":"630018bb5ab81a007d230747","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148516,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert E.
