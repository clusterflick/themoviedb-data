Though his job has earned him respect among his peers, by coming out his status is in jeopardy. However, the desire to share his complex story prompted him to write a screenplay based on his life. Partly a documentary about his autobiographical script, the film switches between documentary and narrative storytelling. Owing to its distinctive style, the film offers a glimpse into the protagonist's world as he faces triple discrimination: as a Roma, as a gay man, and as a gay man in the Roma community.","popularity":0.2014,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":32930,"logo_path":"/pk1mLuYxSmTWX0BdgzbHdUvRI5u.png","name":"FAMU","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2009-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roma Boys – The Love Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1385683,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rozálie Kohoutová","original_name":"Rozálie Kohoutová","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6300f614bb2602007cee9d7b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3672969,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Anežka Cimburková","original_name":"Anežka Cimburková","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63037a0adfe31d008010e593","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costumer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3672972,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Martin Dušek","original_name":"Martin Dušek","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63037a2b67e0f7007d98778b","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costumer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2572450,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ladislav Greiner","original_name":"Ladislav Greiner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63037a455f4b73007af181eb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1385683,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rozálie Kohoutová","original_name":"Rozálie Kohoutová","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63037a4e5f4b73007af181f2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2572450,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ladislav Greiner","original_name":"Ladislav Greiner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63037a584fd141007ce90aa0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1892078,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Evženie Brabcová","original_name":"Evženie Brabcová","popularity":0.1787,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63037a60dfe31d0092050ec7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2559309,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Martina Knoblochová","original_name":"Martina Knoblochová","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63037a7b5f4b73007faae6bc","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187210,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lukáš Kokeš","original_name":"Lukáš Kokeš","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/qaRJX7A76mGamIHKXO38yHui6Zq.jpg","credit_id":"63037a84839d93007e4ce8bd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3672978,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Tišer","original_name":"David Tišer","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63037a914fd141007ce90ab6","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1385683,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rozálie Kohoutová","original_name":"Rozálie Kohoutová","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63037aaa96e30b007a82221d","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1789893","wikidata_id":"Q89566756","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":258407,"name":"romani people"},{"id":275157,"name":"homosexuality"},{"id":280617,"name":"student film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Mezipatra Queer Film Festival","release_date":"2009-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
