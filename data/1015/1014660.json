A seventh-grade boy has an existential crisis, decides that everything in life is purposeless, and climbs up a tree. His classmates try everything to get him down, including pelting him with rocks, but with no success.  As his outlook on life slowly becomes contagious, his classmates create a \"heap of meaning\" to prove him wrong, each offering sacrifices that have deep personal meaning to them. It starts off with superficial donations — a pair of shoes, a fishing rod, assorted teenage knickknacks — but soon the sacrifices take a more demanding and far darker turn.  The adults around them are at a loss to explain or alleviate the existential despair the kids are feeling, and as the extreme measures the classmates take to just feel something, or anything, NOTHING grows dark with dread with every passing minute.","popularity":0.0684,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Nothing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":120600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seamus McNally","original_name":"Seamus McNally","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63003debbf31f20082273243","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":231334,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Trine Piil Christensen","original_name":"Trine Piil Christensen","popularity":0.0907,"profile_path":"/9tzaceqgxuyeIZFv5TSGliVHmkl.jpg","credit_id":"67e661a9a6dd9b0808006d1f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
