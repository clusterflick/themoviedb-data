We see children playing in the school’s functionalist garden (designed by the architect Giuseppe Terragni). The light is cold and it seems as if the sun is low, creating the long shadows of early spring. The image of the children remains in between a spontaneously captured moment and a composed picture. The movement of the young trees suggests that the image is frozen, while it simultaneously continues to melt further into motion, as though undecided in which direction to go.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kindergarten Antonio Sant'Elia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1747035,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Claerbout","original_name":"David Claerbout","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6301282c839d93007e4c2c2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Installation","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
