Rainbow, who changes colors with his feelings, is left on the castle steps of a King and Queen. Now a Prince, he is put to sleep by an evil Wizard and his dangerous cohort scheming to take over the kingdom. Rainbow is temporarily awakened for 21 years by the Mother of the Forest, a wise, powerful healing woman. The sole remedy to reverse the spell forever is a kiss from True Love. This happens to be from a beautiful Brown Princess. Marea must save the Prince and his entire kingdom. The Rainbow Prince is a 30-minute live action film for a K-6 audience that flips the traditional fairy tale narrative to expose children to new models of power and heroism.","popularity":1.04,"poster_path":"/rxp6th5l1oTLkNslYwhBHWt7gQm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":180888,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brown Princess Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Once Upon a Time, a Brown Princess Saved a Prince...","title":"The Rainbow Prince","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":64986,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clare-Hope Ashitey","original_name":"Clare-Hope Ashitey","popularity":0.5731,"profile_path":"/xhvOaoPoCTqhM2CUQVIZlqH7EGB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Princess Marea","credit_id":"63000d183e6f2b007d2711da","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3091124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dwayne Moore","original_name":"Dwayne Moore","popularity":0.1503,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Prince Rainbow","credit_id":"63000d2a245dbe007afc6eeb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2827006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liz Priestley","original_name":"Liz Priestley","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Queen Angela","credit_id":"63000d377dfda6007f328781","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3669985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maxwell Scott","original_name":"Maxwell Scott","popularity":0.1308,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"King Martin","credit_id":"63000d8c1da7a600a4cdb88b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3669987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Mark","original_name":"Jeff Mark","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"A.
