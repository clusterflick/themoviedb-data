Here, in a place humans drown every day on their attempt to flee, the life boat Minden and its crew of volunteer rescuers set an example against indifference. The film takes the viewer along for the 8th mission of the ship, shows the rescues fraught with risk and unmasks the inhuman situation at Europe's gates. In the Mediterranean, not only those seeking help but also the helpers are pushed to their limits.  â€”Thomas Schmidt","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Minden Replying","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7020100","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
