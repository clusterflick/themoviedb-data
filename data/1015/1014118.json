Focusing mainly on cities and provinces in Argentina, Germany, and Bolivia, Emigholz’s latest film is a work of quiet observation and historical excavation. From slaughterhouses in Salamone to the flooded former spa city of Epecuén to the newly built Humboldt Forum in Berlin, the film demonstrates the effect of capital on public spaces, where creation and destruction go hand in hand, and as always, Emigholz makes the journey one of intellectual force and cinematic beauty.","popularity":0.3111,"poster_path":"/yOuvYODewHI48Cnwp3k7H4eKYhG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17178,"logo_path":"/eXbcwmrHmVmgmRFPoYZfbLkt884.png","name":"Filmgalerie
