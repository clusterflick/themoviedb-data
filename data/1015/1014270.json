They then taunted their terrified and blindfolded victim asking if she had any last requests before they cut her throat. But was the kidnap real or just a game? Three days later the tape was in the hands of the police and the 5 teenager friends were in custody facing life imprisonment. This program talks to the people at the heart of this story - including two of the defendants - in an attempt to understand what really happened in the woods around Flint last year. It also screens the video of the 'abduction'. What is revealed is an extraordinary and disturbing record of a night when something went terribly, terribly wrong.","popularity":0.4136,"poster_path":"/7HfqNnRqfKPc8EjN0s8i8ObAuK8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23949,"logo_path":"/3QFwomSxcZZgMQGBkdUPuJEnSFB.png","name":"RAW","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Real Blair Witch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3668675,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Egan","original_name":"Simon Egan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62fecb68a8b2ca007d59ddb8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0472599","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7HfqNnRqfKPc8EjN0s8i8ObAuK8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1930,"name":"kidnapping"},{"id":15460,"name":"bound and gagged"},{"id":18239,"name":"home video"},{"id":33722,"name":"true crime"},{"id":169054,"name":"flint michigan"},{"id":179014,"name":"jury trial"},{"id":187983,"name":"amateur film"},{"id":211461,"name":"amateur footage"},{"id":235261,"name":"abduction"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":284994,"name":"blair witch"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Lost footage, The Real Blair Witch","key":"qfjKd5g3TLM","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-07-24T22:19:00.000Z","id":"62fecd3dfe6c18009388d201"}]}}}
