He meets Frau Ane, Asmus' wife; Ane yearns to have a baby but in vain so the devil takes advantage of Frau Ane's motherly inner desire by making a deal with her but for his own purposes. As a result, the farmer's wife comes under the devil's spell and then seduces the local priest, giving the devil to chance to build his own church to replace the old church that has burned down.","popularity":0.2074,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":122631,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lucifer-Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1919-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Devil's Church","video":false,"vote_average":6.889,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1062881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Mierendorff","original_name":"Hans Mierendorff","popularity":0.1007,"profile_path":"/pBz86fkMY6zGuwMGiAw38ddByrT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Pfarrer","credit_id":"52fe4ac89251416c750edde9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agnes Straub","original_name":"Agnes Straub","popularity":0.0541,"profile_path":"/aUawmPB84VhEbLAwYvTjVRyBTWw.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ane","credit_id":"52fe4ac89251416c750edded","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225292,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Rehkopf","original_name":"Paul Rehkopf","popularity":0.1952,"profile_path":"/8EVxQ1JfSCw0CrOujlFOa0HtPKe.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Devil","credit_id":"52fe4ac89251416c750eddf1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helga Mjön","original_name":"Helga Mjön","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5d6eca5d64f716001580d979","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Immler","original_name":"Fred Immler","popularity":0.0882,"profile_path":"/mmbbBF6NtSRPlSXjoNhwxvmfUve.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5d6eca666aa8e000104247b5","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1062881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Mierendorff","original_name":"Hans Mierendorff","popularity":0.1007,"profile_path":"/pBz86fkMY6zGuwMGiAw38ddByrT.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ac89251416c750edde5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28994,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adolf Paul","original_name":"Adolf Paul","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/o69Z7A8HCUUD6a6OQZaLYA4LDLK.jpg","credit_id":"5d6eca44c8113d000e71c655","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0010767","wikidata_id":"Q17122822","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5810,"name":"pact with the devil"},{"id":215678,"name":"partially lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1919-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
