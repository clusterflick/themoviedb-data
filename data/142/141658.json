Three girls from Lourdes, France, gather firewood in front of a grotto. Suddenly one of them, Bernadette Soubirous, 14, drops to her knees, gazes ecstatically at something beautiful only she can see, and starts to pray. Soon the town buzzes: Has Bernadette, poor, sickly, and always behind in school, really seen a Lady from Heaven? Then a spring bubbles up from nowhere and withered arms and sightless eyes are cured.  At last, the Lady tells Bernadette her name: “I am The Immaculate Concepcion.”  BERNADETTE, THE PRINCESS OF LOURDES, is the exciting true story of a visit by the Queen of Heaven that left the entire world a source of health for body and soul.","popularity":0.1141,"poster_path":"/rtFuv2Mpp1xaaInYzLDySeAxAP0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87990,"logo_path":null,"name":"CCC of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bernadette: The Princess of Lourdes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Bernadette - The Princess of Lourdes","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13707612","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.695,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rtFuv2Mpp1xaaInYzLDySeAxAP0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":890}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
