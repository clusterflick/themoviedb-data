Once there he discovers that the old adage of making a film three times, once in the writing, once in the shooting and once in the editing, is in fact just the opposite in his host country, where his film is unmade three times. Undaunted by his inability to speak or understand the Mandarin language, Kofman directs his frequently recast actors through a translator as government censorship and constant cultural mishaps hijack his script and derail production. Like Man of la Mancha set in Communist China, there has never been a film quite like this.","popularity":0.0645,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unmade in China","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tanner King Barklow","original_name":"Tanner King Barklow","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f7478b944a57005e3aee17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":932355,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gil Kofman","original_name":"Gil Kofman","popularity":0.0856,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f74861c439c0007284afd3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tanner King Barklow","original_name":"Tanner King Barklow","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f74790fd140b0046398d50","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":932355,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gil Kofman","original_name":"Gil Kofman","popularity":0.0856,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f74867af58cb0046cfadfa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2355666","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
