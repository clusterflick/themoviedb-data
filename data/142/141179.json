Her prize is a quest - to find C&W star Jed Wood, give him a kiss, and report on her adventure on the following week's show. Ray Timmons, a middle aged documentary cameraman, is the only person available to document her on her quest. Together they travel to New York, meet up with a jaded sound recordist, Mike, and set about chasing down Jed - arriving at film sets, recording studios, everywhere Jed is due to be. Their progress is followed by a couple of DJs on a local radio station. During the week the chase continues, their relationship changes, and they learn a lot about each other and bout pursuing their own dreams, before they return to face the music back home.","popularity":1.251,"poster_path":"/kxIGBWcmf168amoLIRULQtifm2F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United
