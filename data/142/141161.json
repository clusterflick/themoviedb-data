The same crew who brought you last year’s Nice Try team up with legends like JP Walker and Jeremy Jones alongside young wizards like Joe Sexton and Zac Marben. Cheers bridges the gap between pedigree and potential—with a variety of talent, terrain, and locations to make this the best People movie yet. Filmed in crispy HD digital video with a wicked soundtrack, Cheers takes viewers up-close and on-location to Lake Tahoe, Finland, Sweden, Whistler, Revelstoke, Washington, Utah, Oregon, Minnesota, and Newfoundland for a full season of good times and great snowboarding.","popularity":0.1407,"poster_path":"/vNXftjEvZXaoSXjjav0d4W0M3y1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cheers","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1114268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aron
