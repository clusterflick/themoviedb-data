Mr. Van Loock is a rabid supporter of the extreme right-wing political party Flemish bloc. Mr. Fawzi, a Moroccan immigrant, is a conservative Muslim. In October 2000, one week prior to a hotly contested national election, 17-year-old Leilah Fawzi falls for 19-year-old Berwout Van Loock. This development sparks a sometimes hilarious and sometimes politically incorrect love story that explores the thin walls between love and hate.","popularity":0.1749,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The thin walls between love and hate","title":"Kassablanka","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1115701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Aernouts","original_name":"Roy Aernouts","popularity":0.0635,"profile_path":"/2oUhdySmGXZKLfBPxjcWl72r9Kk.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Berwout Van Loock","credit_id":"52fe4ac39251416c750ed281","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1115702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mo Barich","original_name":"Mo Barich","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Mostafa Fawzi","credit_id":"52fe4ac39251416c750ed285","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1115703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mostafa Benkerroum","original_name":"Mostafa Benkerroum","popularity":0.1188,"profile_path":"/aiClenWqpeaGdMDSNj98OM9RYlz.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mohamed Abdelouafi","credit_id":"52fe4ac39251416c750ed289","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1115704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amid Chakir","original_name":"Amid Chakir","popularity":0.0998,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Nonkel Nourredine","credit_id":"52fe4ac39251416c750ed28d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1095168,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guy Lee Thys","original_name":"Guy Lee Thys","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ac39251416c750ed271","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1095168,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guy Lee Thys","original_name":"Guy Lee Thys","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ac39251416c750ed277","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1115700,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Boeckmans","original_name":"Ivan Boeckmans","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ac39251416c750ed27d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0330513","wikidata_id":"Q4340019","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
