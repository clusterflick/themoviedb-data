The film sets out to illustrate the old adage, \"For want of a nail, the battle was lost,\" showing how the inferior quality of something so trivial as a nail in a soldier's boot leads inexorably to the capture of an armored train. Kalatozov had intended to demonstrate the crucial and universal importance of efficiency in Soviet industry, but the government decided that his fable gave a negative impression of the Red Army's capabilities.","popularity":0.3056,"poster_path":"/cTzlpNtQgBwrBBnARxwIB0moDnh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":186508,"logo_path":"/dONUQvMFW5X8DCw6nX9Dk26TQwF.png","name":"Georgia-Film","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1931-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Nail in the Boot","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":14,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1408123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleqsandre Jaliashvili","original_name":"ალექსანდრე ჯალიაშვილი","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"653258c8481382013972ead5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2025238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siko Palavandishvili","original_name":"Siko Palavandishvili","popularity":0.13,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5ad7555d0e0a2674d800e04e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1346732,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akaki Khorava","original_name":"აკაკი ხორავა","popularity":0.237,"profile_path":"/yPUswzOP6HI7cbEbONmzscZ5bCF.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5ad75564c3a368480200e536","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":938553,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arkadi Khintibidze","original_name":"არკადი ხინთიბიძე","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/djjkEuFxBGJpIAlj56MuGwLSvQz.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5ad7556d9251413b3700fc43","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108764,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikhail Kalatozov","original_name":"Mikhail Kalatozov","popularity":0.1501,"profile_path":"/1RTm958MhWTNjD8CHFx7Z8u2gU7.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ac69251416c750ed967","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2025237,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Leonid Perelman","original_name":"Leonid Perelman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ad7553ac3a368480200e503","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2629109,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Shalva Apaqidze","original_name":"Shalva Apaqidze","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb4590bf3e0df001f2b0d77","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2266180,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Serapion Vatsadze","original_name":"სერაფიონ ვაცაძე","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb4593c66469a001ce2d0d6","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0022970","wikidata_id":"Q4134586","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dhRcWVhziv2szbHw8XiYSE0z0Wa.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.691,"height":971,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/eaeVut7V7ODpinM1P0DXaYdu9wm.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":671},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/uJUke5BvPjSpyeWqwna0UewpIXO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cTzlpNtQgBwrBBnARxwIB0moDnh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2903,"name":"propaganda"},{"id":247059,"name":"film parable"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Whole Soviet Union","release_date":"1932-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1931-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
