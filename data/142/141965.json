While the Koryo overlords become bloated on a lifestyle of luxury and decadence, a series of farmer’s revolts rock the country, only to be mercilessly quashed. During one such uprising, the parents of a young girl, Somi, are ruthlessly murdered by the brutal government vassal Hyon Ryu Bal. The shock causes Somi to lose her voice, as she flees by boat for her life. She is rescued and taken in by Dosa, a white-haired martial arts master, along with another young boy from Somi's village, Ung Gom, orphaned in the same raid. As Dosa raises the two in his martial arts school, Somi and Ung Gom grow up together like brother and sister, waiting until their day of vengeance arrives.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/1PgXxUMhp2s9jri1j3wkIwHNl2N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":206309,"logo_path":null,"name":"Korean Film Studio","origin_country":""},{"id":228017,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canario Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"KP","name":"North Korea"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Somi, The Taekwon-Do Woman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4692663,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kim Sae Il","original_name":"Kim Sae Il","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663577940f52650128baed70","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1600701,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masao Kobayashi","original_name":"Masao Kobayashi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663577fb2a09bc012c592f3f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4692668,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Wi Yon Song","original_name":"Wi Yon Song","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6635783f9590e30129bbad94","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1600701,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masao Kobayashi","original_name":"Masao Kobayashi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663577dec0442901268f3248","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4692660,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chang Yong Bok","original_name":"Chang Yong Bok","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663577702a09bc012c592f2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4692666,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Si-jun Han","original_name":"Si-jun Han","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6635781dc9054f01308f5041","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2377230","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":879,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1VxqTq21SDD65f0787HHJ2b4Dm1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1563}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/1PgXxUMhp2s9jri1j3wkIwHNl2N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":531}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
