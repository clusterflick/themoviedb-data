If you have a degree in accounting, engineering, biotechnology, or computer technology, consider becoming a technical writer (technical author in the UK). You don't necessarily need a degree to become a technical writer but it doesn't hurt. The alternative is to get a technical writing certificate. It's imperative to know how to write for technical and non-technical audiences.
