Through films such as The Searchers, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence, Little Big Man, The Wild Bunch and Unforgiven, Rich charts the rise and fall of America's obsession with its own creation myth - the Wild West. He explores how the image of the cowboy as a moral, straight-talking heroic figure was created by Hollywood but appropriated by Washington, as one president after another sought to associate themselves with this potent symbol of strength and valour.","popularity":0.9009,"poster_path":"/kbEV9HREwmEbbQsmLHhNk1BieO2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2963,"logo_path":null,"name":"Open Mike Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rich Hall's How The West Was Lost","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rich Hall","original_name":"Rich Hall","popularity":0.4068,"profile_path":"/yhi9nbWKtgBrVXfAfFJAf18a6Y5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4abf9251416c750eca1d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178871,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Cottam","original_name":"Chris Cottam","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/8zeVrISbvgz5YD7OAWTBMBSTwhF.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4abf9251416c750eca23","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1178872,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maggie Womersley","original_name":"Maggie Womersley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4abf9251416c750eca29","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1178873,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Karen Eva Hall","original_name":"Karen Eva Hall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4abf9251416c750eca2f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1178874,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Suzanne Gilfillan","original_name":"Suzanne Gilfillan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4abf9251416c750eca35","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116059,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Addison Cresswell","original_name":"Addison Cresswell","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4abf9251416c750eca3b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1178875,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anthony Caveney","original_name":"Anthony Caveney","popularity":0.0523,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4abf9251416c750eca41","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116058,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrew Beint","original_name":"Andrew Beint","popularity":0.0875,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4abf9251416c750eca47","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116058,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrew Beint","original_name":"Andrew Beint","popularity":0.0875,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4abf9251416c750eca4d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":565867,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ceri Barnes","original_name":"Ceri Barnes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4abf9251416c750eca53","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1461633,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mark Henson","original_name":"Mark Henson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55439051c3a3680cd5001f7e","department":"Editing","job":"Editorial Services"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1248282","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kbEV9HREwmEbbQsmLHhNk1BieO2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":185242,"name":"western filmmaking"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
