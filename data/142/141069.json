Now in this two hour History Channel TV Special, his former student Wade Davis, follows in his footsteps to experience the discoveries that Schultes brought to the western world. Shot around the planet, from Canada to the Amazon, we experience rarely seen native hallucinogenic ceremonies and find out the true events leading up to the Psychedelic Sixties. Featuring author/adventurer Wade Davis (\"Serpent and the Rainbow\"), Dr. Andrew Weil, the Grateful Dead's Bob Weir and many others, this program tells the story of the discovery of peyote, magic mushrooms and beyond: one man's little known quest to classify the Plants of the Gods. Richard Evans Schultes revolutionized science and spawned another revolution he never imagined.","popularity":0.9138,"poster_path":"/tLGYkDiFk0sqyXzJv3sQvhAQ496.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16288,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gryphon Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The untold story of hallucinogens: from jungle shamans to the hippie generation.","title":"Peyote to LSD: A Psychedelic Odyssey","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1263376,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Wade Davis","original_name":"Wade Davis","popularity":0.0564,"profile_path":"/eV8HaHwidCK5TCZIWMPqAlJzceq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self / Presenter","credit_id":"5e6d0bcd356a710011790838","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy Leary","original_name":"Timothy Leary","popularity":0.1858,"profile_path":"/kFTPQ1ood6HKh1hRRr4wLe76JHN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5e6d0c4da9b9a40012a06c7f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1383814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Weil","original_name":"Andrew Weil","popularity":0.057,"profile_path":"/7NPweF6LoGAZRw2v6mvVGbvZh1F.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e6d0c8a356a71001579204f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1263368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Narby","original_name":"Jeremy Narby","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/3C4jUf5u0Ef2W9EXDXY0EXKwSZ5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e6d0cb0357c0000194254e5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2566183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Randy Borman","original_name":"Randy Borman","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":"/inLaFGg1u7BFH74atC1895249CV.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e6d0ce3cabfe4001113861b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89860,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Aldous Huxley","original_name":"Aldous Huxley","popularity":0.2639,"profile_path":"/cimy7zlaOVoXNTCwcaDnCoUyQ9v.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5e6d0d1c2f3b170011436026","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1390203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin A.
