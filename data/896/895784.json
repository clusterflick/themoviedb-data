The Government-General awarded medals to loyal citizens for exemplary achievement of these tasks. In particular, on the day of Patriots Day, all people had to stop what they were doing and pay their respects on the spot following the time signal. A woman washing clothes, elderly people ice fishing, and factory workers; men and women of all ages pay tribute in silence at the time signal, which makes for stirring cinema. Although the film was made to promote Patriots Day, the villagers' various community activities such as the rice-saving movement, the waste collection campaign, and collaborative farming are presented in a peaceful fashion.
