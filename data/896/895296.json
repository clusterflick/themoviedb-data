In her very personal account “I follow a voice within me”, we enter her world and learn about her motivations, aspirations, and her joyful way of pursuing them. In addition to personal insights, this truly ingenious portrait presents Waltraud Meier on stage and in rehearsal in her most celebrated Wagner roles and as an interpreter of Mahler’s Lieder. It becomes clear how she coined today’s musical world when other great musicians such as Daniel Barenboim or Plácido Domingo speak about her and her work. This beautiful portrait of one of the greatest interpreters of our time is rounded off with a powerful recording of Mahler’s “Lied von der Erde”.","popularity":0.1868,"poster_path":"/e0GIP2JFFdwb8oP22RRm4TH3693.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Waltraud Meier: I follow a voice within me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":553684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Waltraud Meier","original_name":"Waltraud Meier","popularity":0.2063,"profile_path":"/pk4rLWSbJmsKqxkoYFPm16re0zC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6187ceb2e74146002b776786","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siegfried Jerusalem","original_name":"Siegfried Jerusalem","popularity":0.1909,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6187cf5c595a560029b2ed98","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Barenboim","original_name":"Daniel Barenboim","popularity":0.1008,"profile_path":"/pNoHzRlu3vNQmQsB7XrmrFYjOd1.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6187cf67ddd52d008a03f93d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Plácido Domingo","original_name":"Plácido Domingo","popularity":0.342,"profile_path":"/r0OUJ630b7dllOFBQ4SElP3XnpC.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6187cf70d388ae008a153f1b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1377321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Sotin","original_name":"Hans Sotin","popularity":0.056,"profile_path":"/fjlkAstdGHYPBBIDYbvo4f0M1fl.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6187d114fe6318008fb95f64","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3300318,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Zabrsa","original_name":"Angela Zabrsa","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6187d120fe63180044bc2e4a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jürgen Flimm","original_name":"Jürgen Flimm","popularity":0.0765,"profile_path":"/sup1Y4OPkV8v3HW9OFFj9Cotu0l.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6187d12d70309f006188e05c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1560848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ioan Holender","original_name":"Ioan Holender","popularity":0.0762,"profile_path":"/5rP18MqSUrEC85vfrxBO0Ufaot0.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6187d13ffe63180064855abd","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3300319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephan Suschke","original_name":"Stephan Suschke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6187d16013a3880044f05f24","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3300309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annette Schreier","original_name":"Annette Schreier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6187cedc595a5600636fb3ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.723,"height":1171,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e0GIP2JFFdwb8oP22RRm4TH3693.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":847}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2008-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
