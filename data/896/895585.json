Lewis and producer Elizabeth Taylor-Mead have constructed their argument well, but it is Jonathan Dimbleby's brief comments towards the end that contain the crucial lesson: forty years on, the same forces work to distort our view of Northern Ireland. The film only indicates this to be the case, but it is precise and coherent enough to make the point with considerable force.","popularity":0.1965,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1977-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Before Hindsight","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086467,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Edgar Anstey","original_name":"Edgar Anstey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/eJdn6dkMbySMdMXfj2dMGAECgRH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6188a43613a388002b1aab86","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2410557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark James Walter Cameron","original_name":"Mark James Walter Cameron","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/2tBUUrXe2Dt1YfGYvRB9LOJX2GQ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6188a484595a560063718f03","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1246376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Dimbleby","original_name":"Jonathan Dimbleby","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/awyjKEU9bH0UD8wvOO0C3GGXs60.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6188a495cee481006410cb9b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3301120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Elvin","original_name":"George Elvin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6188a4a1e74146004392ffbf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":142386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leslie Mitchell","original_name":"Leslie Mitchell","popularity":0.1289,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6188a4bc13a3880044f22f53","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivor Montagu","original_name":"Ivor Montagu","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6188a4e175f1ad00625b3ee4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3301123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerald Sanger","original_name":"Gerald Sanger","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6188a4ed7d41aa0043b80c81","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1663304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Taylor-Mead","original_name":"Elizabeth Taylor-Mead","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6188a52b0752880044dba44a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1416951,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Peter Maxwell","original_name":"Peter Maxwell","popularity":0.1015,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6188a56e2cde980095bbb2c5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1597455,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Lewis","original_name":"Jonathan Lewis","popularity":0.0654,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6188a54466a7c3002176d872","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1597455,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Lewis","original_name":"Jonathan Lewis","popularity":0.0654,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6188a51af8aee80066347eb6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3301125,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tony Nicholls","original_name":"Tony Nicholls","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6188a586d388ae002c05e37a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3301124,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nick Claxton","original_name":"Nick Claxton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6188a550f8aee80066347f14","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Roger Deakins","original_name":"Roger Deakins","popularity":0.3466,"profile_path":"/pSCN7CfILlfQrxX43Kgqrx5mBYQ.jpg","credit_id":"61fa8efdcb80284acff21d74","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0075735","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
