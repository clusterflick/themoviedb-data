The film tells the story of four visionaries from around the world - 102-year-old inventor Dr. James Lovelock, biomimicry biologist Janine Benyus, designer Arthur Huang, and financier John Fullerton - whose extraordinary experiences changed the way they think about humanity’s future. Each of their stories leads them to a fundamental reassessment of what our food, our cities, our financial system, even our fashion industry could look like if we create, produce, and distribute within Earth's natural boundaries.","popularity":0.751,"poster_path":"/3pfPebauTe5KFhS0E2qRlmpYUzL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20431,"logo_path":"/bdt71You43kh8tdpD55pLVlWIAh.png","name":"Off the Fence","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":11237,"logo_path":"/nzPEges9ftjCDQWru0qrIfTX8OR.png","name":"ZDF/Arte","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":84339,"logo_path":"/xHTkcQihsN49kgVZNWEHT4omGym.png","name":"ZDF Enterprises","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2021-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Going Circular","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1245686,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nigel Walk","original_name":"Nigel Walk","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61890b3d160e730029e18715","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116306,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Dale","original_name":"Richard Dale","popularity":0.169,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61890b5dfe63180064879eac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kptyXM8FGXi5llt3aPgAdFRDgLV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3pfPebauTe5KFhS0E2qRlmpYUzL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1536}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":219890,"name":"sustainability"},{"id":257091,"name":"sustainable solutions"},{"id":272851,"name":"environmental documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ARTE","release_date":"2022-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ARTE","release_date":"2022-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"festival","release_date":"2021-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
