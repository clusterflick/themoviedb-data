This is a strategic zone controlled by various armies in the midst of a region that awaits reconstruction. The film stems from the simple question of how to tell the story of a country of which the West is deprived of images. Both fiction and documentary, it is about reality and the means of telling it.","popularity":0.2424,"poster_path":"/lBe8R7uPzqrle8rpMqpsN3wqfR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61201,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anna Sanders Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":68065,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fondation de France","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2000-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le pont du trieur","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19361,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thibault de Montalembert","original_name":"Thibault de Montalembert","popularity":0.4184,"profile_path":"/rlmatSXCig3KrEeTh1yKVTOZnMc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Radio speaker","credit_id":"6187df2270309f006188f2da","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35893,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camille Japy","original_name":"Camille Japy","popularity":0.2708,"profile_path":"/lfdIIkhlh2nQ94iRq4pC3UYxJX6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Radio speaker","credit_id":"6187df393faba000625cee48","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3300394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ogonozar Aknazarov","original_name":"Ogonozar Aknazarov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6187df4875f1ad0062595ceb","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69761,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charles de Meaux","original_name":"Charles de Meaux","popularity":0.1094,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6187df641fd36f0042bb736c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55404,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philippe Parreno","original_name":"Philippe Parreno","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6187df6e70309f008eca1795","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55404,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philippe Parreno","original_name":"Philippe Parreno","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6187df77a313b8002a8f50f8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69761,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charles de Meaux","original_name":"Charles de Meaux","popularity":0.1094,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6187df821c6aa70060f15bfc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0243500","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2998,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lBe8R7uPzqrle8rpMqpsN3wqfR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
