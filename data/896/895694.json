With insider testimony from those who knew him and unseen archive footage, Michael X: Hustler, Revolutionary, Outlaw provides a chance to re-evaluate this divisive historical figure who spent the end of his days on death row until he was eventually executed by signed order of the Queen. Exploring a defining period of modern British history, we unravel Michael’s childhood in Trinidad, the genesis of the British Black Power Movement and the intoxicating days of counterculture and Notting Hill Carnival, before returning to the Caribbean where Michael was tried and convicted of murder.","popularity":0.0356,"poster_path":"/hVyDfa7uUofWdOOq9C0g6v0rKJL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117455,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sky Original Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":216100,"logo_path":"/j81yKMaTovhKX25qbrwtnIyisuG.png","name":"BBC Studios Specialist Factual Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The rise and fall of Michael X","title":"Michael X: Hustler, Revolutionary, Outlaw","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1450674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Van Der Pool","original_name":"James Van Der Pool","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619294f501757f008a7b182a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hVyDfa7uUofWdOOq9C0g6v0rKJL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sky Documentaries","release_date":"2021-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
