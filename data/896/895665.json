Shot on 16mm film and digital video at his Victoria, BC home and studio over the course of a year, the film follows Raxlen’s daily practice, uncovering the rituals and gestures of a creative process. Mining the highly specific and personal nature of this life-sized project, excerpts from Raxlen’s films, drawings, paintings and mark-making from a 50+ year art practice combine with hand-processed and manipulated film materials to play off the rites and relaxed rigour of his unique approach to making a life.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/oLVwtDRLH673WXAOYVP4Kf5uZsB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2020-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Think Before You Think: A Portrait of Rick Raxlen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1880983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rick Raxlen","original_name":"Rick Raxlen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/6S2054RYwU48Hj7O10R8aotcBDZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"618909131c6aa7002ca6d401","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2349394,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex MacKenzie","original_name":"Alex MacKenzie","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/8Pa5QCZyq2Gc7CXTIObpULLQ0Vl.jpg","credit_id":"61890839a313b800624a49d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oLVwtDRLH673WXAOYVP4Kf5uZsB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Antimatter Media Art","release_date":"2020-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
