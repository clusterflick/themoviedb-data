The operation is neatly planned. Are they occupiers? Vandals? Far from it! Their goal is to escape the confinement of their homes. They need to free themselves from the shackles of everyday life. It is not a break-in, but a break-out. And so it begins. The five withdraw and begin their individual ritual. Their lust can be felt, their power is contagious. No one can stop what has been unleashed.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unleash","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2567425,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sean Wirz","original_name":"Sean Wirz","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6186e9b269d28000933477d6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2567425,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sean Wirz","original_name":"Sean Wirz","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6186e9a53faba0008f66341b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14085366","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
