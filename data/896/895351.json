Most shocking of all, the truth about Her Majesty’s role will be hidden from the Queen herself, and even the all-powerful Shah who will be used by Britain and American to replace Iran’s last democratic Prime Minister. The coup will lead to political upheaval all over the Middle East for decades to come, eventually resulting in the Islamic Revolution of 1979 which will end the reign of the Shah, and British and American influence in Iran, inspiring countless other Islamist revolutions around the world.","popularity":1.0128,"poster_path":"/sV5uaH6pNaRjVRXJWhOrsC0R202.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112197,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brave New Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Queen and the Coup","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Die Queen und der Putsch im Iran","type":"TV"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","title":"Le coup d'Etat de la Reine","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1227794,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline Catz","original_name":"Caroline Catz","popularity":0.5558,"profile_path":"/nZn7unhXz5kS537kFJmCB5S2n3Q.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6187f4ce1fd36f0042bb9e1c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3529614,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rory Cormac","original_name":"Rory Cormac","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"626c898335811d005016aea0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3529615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard J.
