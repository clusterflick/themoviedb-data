The film is freely inspired in the original version of Rashomon –written by Ryūnosuke Akutagawa– and, as usual in his filmography since P3ND3JO5 (2013), Perrone blends different elements from classical film; in this case, visible ghosts from Kurosawa’s cinema and certain aspects of Japan’s traditional culture melt with nightmarish distortions and machinistical irruptions, typical of a future that may never come. “The avant-garde is in the past” he once said in an interview. In his reimagining of film history, Perrone again finds an inexhaustible field of expression.","popularity":0.0731,"poster_path":"/m3KinM4G8Sw4rGDix6hGuQ05gi3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89512,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Envies que Je te
