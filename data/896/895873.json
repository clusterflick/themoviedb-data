That’s a daunting challenge in the Andes, where many women are marginalized.  But few things deter Nelida, and she succeeds in organizing cooperatives around skills like weaving and quinoa. Then the unexpected happens — she’s invited to run for mayor by a new political party. Fed up with the region's decline and corruption, she accepts the challenge. Can she become the first woman to win, running on a platform of sustainable development and anti-corruption?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/qMjpOqxb6d7tLrJZbwUvXXi1OvE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"After living in NYC for 20 years, ​​Nelida returns to her birthplace to help women start businesses ​— and ends up running for mayor.","title":"Return to the Andes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","title":"Regreso a los Andes","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3196336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nelida Silva","original_name":"Nelida Silva","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Candidate for Mayor","credit_id":"6189c126f8aee80091f39935","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3302119,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mitch Teplitsky","original_name":"Mitch Teplitsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6189c0a0160e73009356cd29","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5779118","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qMjpOqxb6d7tLrJZbwUvXXi1OvE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
