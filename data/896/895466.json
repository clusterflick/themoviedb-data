A doppelganger, a crime scene and the tidal erasure of what might have taken place: discomfiting moments in a bright, almost psychedelic, arc. Assembled from 16mm, Super 8, and digital video, stop motion collage and digital compositing animation, \"Water Over Glass\" works backwards from an original story by Jason Zumpano and its musical articulation—Vancouver outfit The Cyrillic Typewriter’s 2018 album of the same name—to suspend a visual form over a sonic narrative.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/tulrtZUhNQ3PnW8S6t9EvEvQBS3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Water Over Glass","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1907033,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amanda Thomson","original_name":"Amanda Thomson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61882e850752880063cfc702","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3056227,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zoe Kirk-Gushowaty","original_name":"Zoe Kirk-Gushowaty","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61882e8ed388ae004300c952","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1914926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kellen Jackson","original_name":"Kellen Jackson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61882f2b595a5600637072b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3300748,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jimi Pantalon","original_name":"Jimi Pantalon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61882f35ddd52d0061685c9b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tulrtZUhNQ3PnW8S6t9EvEvQBS3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Antimatter Media Art","release_date":"2020-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Vancouver International Film Festival","release_date":"2019-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
