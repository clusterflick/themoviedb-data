She proves very capable, and he comes to value her. Sometime later Jerry Henley, the owner of the camp, arrives on a tour of inspection, accompanied by his secretary, Graves. The latter is an old confidence man, who had once wronged Grace, and he threatens to expose her if she gives his game away. Jim overhears, kicking Graves out of the camp, forcing him to write a note to his employer, saying that he has been called out of town on business. Jim thinks Grace has fallen for Henley and steps aside. But when Henley departs Grace tells Jim she really loves him, and the lovers are united.","popularity":0.1752,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":52438,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bison Motion Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Better Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Holt","original_name":"Jack Holt","popularity":0.1284,"profile_path":"/4xfh3Mlpqx8tZ991rhVTov0ILtN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Joe Cullison","credit_id":"618802cde7414600439173ea","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1377310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucille Young","original_name":"Lucille Young","popularity":0.0982,"profile_path":"/b22d4sw1eRVljNIlQS9MjLhlaug.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Grace Ivers","credit_id":"618802db595a56004390a904","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1059719,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Nelson","original_name":"Jack Nelson","popularity":0.1447,"profile_path":"/287tmZiqPIXmMr1p88x2wBenWf2.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jerry Henley","credit_id":"618802eacb6db500623992e9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1321419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert MacQuarrie","original_name":"Albert MacQuarrie","popularity":0.1071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Graves - Henley's Secretary","credit_id":"618802f8cee481008f456255","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1156984,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jay Hunt","original_name":"Jay Hunt","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":"/9S4lQHWJLv6uSVF7c1901LbMMxB.jpg","credit_id":"618802b13faba0008f683510","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117576,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bennett Cohen","original_name":"Bennett Cohen","popularity":0.0654,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618802bde93e9500626583e1","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0326759","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1916-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
