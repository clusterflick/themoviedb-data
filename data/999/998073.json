In this documentary, the crew gained access to the men and women behind one of the most disturbing musical movements. It reveals how British neo-Nazis and skinheads plan to launch 'Project School-Yard' in Britain after a similar scheme was tried out in the United States. In the UK, the team follows one of the most infamous British white-power bands, Whitelaw, as they prepare for one of the biggest gigs of their career. The band are filmed on stage, with riot police surrounding the venue, performing as the forces of law and order move in to shut down their hate-filled act. The film also contains shocking images of hate rock concerts in the USA where, thanks to the first amendment protecting freedom of speech, anything goes.","popularity":0.3522,"poster_path":"/isc906pnFVNFbxFUgLV6I8dtxhj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16849,"logo_path":null,"name":"Extreme Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2006-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nazi Hate Rock","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Nazi Hate Rock: A Donal Macintyre Investigation","type":"Full Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1058434,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donal MacIntyre","original_name":"Donal MacIntyre","popularity":0.1179,"profile_path":"/mzQMgsnExIYug0KZuxQmWzfulC9.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"62ca236ce8d028004f18d61d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3080878,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Simkin","original_name":"Michael Simkin","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ca214a95665800fc18fcd8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3612405,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Neil Mackay","original_name":"Neil Mackay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ca21ade0ca7f0054cf41a6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3618182,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jim Manson","original_name":"Jim Manson","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ca21e6e0ca7f004c36edd0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3080878,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Simkin","original_name":"Michael Simkin","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ca21ffe8d0280057a66325","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6648866","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/isc906pnFVNFbxFUgLV6I8dtxhj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":525}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":376,"name":"neo-nazism"},{"id":379,"name":"skinhead"},{"id":4470,"name":"punk rock"},{"id":11700,"name":"rock music"},{"id":12425,"name":"racism"},{"id":209044,"name":"white supremacy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
