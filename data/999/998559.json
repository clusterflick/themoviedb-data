In the sinuous tangle of projective shadows, an observable process takes place. The emergent thermal beings not only compute a circular (convecting) current, but also briefly maintain this rotational circuit in a rhythmic equilibrium. Poised between liquid and gas states, the thermal beings form a coherent structure for an intense moment on the edge of chaos.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/rUNtkDJIQkc8hFSN1P3hmV5uQtf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Teakettle’s Thermal Beings","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2816767,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Lattanzi","original_name":"Barbara Lattanzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/77CdlZCkzTs2ZmJpZzCNNqTnMbx.jpg","credit_id":"62cb8d861685da0055da015b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":794,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rUNtkDJIQkc8hFSN1P3hmV5uQtf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":529}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
