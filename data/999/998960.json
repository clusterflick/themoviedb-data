Using sharp black and white contrast, step-and-repeat optical effects, slow motion, and an original soundtrack composed by Shaw, the film amplifies the unique, cathartic movements of the protagonist's dance, both eloquent and violent. Variation FQ is a study of the co-evolution of subculture, gender, dance, and special effects.","popularity":0.0545,"poster_path":"/sGHolqABfLzl0kPO4anuU4XmWxF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Variation FQ","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2544402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leiomy Maldonado","original_name":"Leiomy Maldonado","popularity":0.1444,"profile_path":"/eF1u63RP79NBZDjfu9QiIOkEBJn.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"herself","credit_id":"62ccbf094c1bb000507d5e69","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1437787,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeremy Shaw","original_name":"Jeremy Shaw","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/upYZEdyV21VC66RFEYcAldLaZg3.jpg","credit_id":"62ccbeeea9117f0bb3b3c88b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sGHolqABfLzl0kPO4anuU4XmWxF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
