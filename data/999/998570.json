In March 1923 the expedition, which included Te Rangi Hiroa (Sir Peter Buck), James McDonald, Elsdon Best and Johannes Andersen, set out for the Ngata homestead at Waiomatatini which was to be their base. From Waiomatatini visits were made to Whareponga, Kahukura, Rangitukia, Te Araroa, Ruatoria and other parts of the district. MacDonald recorded on film traditional skills retained in the area for making fishnets and traps, methods of netting and catching fish, weaving, hand games and music making.
