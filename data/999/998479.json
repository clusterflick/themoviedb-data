Alvin wished he were bigger, and his wish comes true big-time when he winds up a hot-shot exec at a hip, happening record company. But when you're bigger, you're too big for such fun things as Little League. This takes a little rethinking ... and a whole lotta reshrinking on Alvin's part. The laughs are big and fast in this spoof of the movie hit that made Tom Hanks big!","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/7AeVCzmalpYggA08svrE0YAEwH6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alvin and the Chipmunks Go to the Movies: Bigger","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7AeVCzmalpYggA08svrE0YAEwH6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
