In 1965, the Colonial British authorities declared the isle separate from Mauritius in exchange of its independence. Then, the United States rented Diego Garcia, the largest of the isles, to install a military base and the population was sent to Mauritius. The Chagossians have spent the past 36 years living in extreme poverty in Mauritius, dreaming of one day going home.","popularity":0.07,"poster_path":"/j6iHjqSWJ0tkrrZUpfzZgGMTLIW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109700,"logo_path":"/n8F7DsdQJ4h4EZMXvmIsAxB5ZrN.png","name":"Caméléon Production","origin_country":"MU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MU","name":"Mauritius"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diego, The Forbidden Island","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Diego, The Forbidden Island","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1687624,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Constantin","original_name":"David Constantin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62cbe828a9117f0054f1dcc1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1687624,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Constantin","original_name":"David Constantin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62cbe87be8131d0fb85f1dea","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1687624,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Constantin","original_name":"David Constantin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62cbe894595a5612b8a46bbd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3619877,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jerôme Valin","original_name":"Jerôme Valin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62cbe8a39566580f80ccc999","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1687624,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Constantin","original_name":"David Constantin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62cbe8b5fd4a960f4e832dab","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j6iHjqSWJ0tkrrZUpfzZgGMTLIW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
