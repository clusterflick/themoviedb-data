In comparison, injecting such a problem into an analog video signal is more clear-cut. That is, one can use electronic feedback to affect the image raster (its “frame”), collapsing the entire image-field in an elaborate morphogenetic display. However, with digital video, the destabilizing (and deterritorializing) of the frame is very indirect. Thus, instead of an electronic signal, “Indirect” uses a dataset of a turbulent phenomenon – in this case, the blowing wind. These changes in wind intensity, the continual flux of gusts and calm, are derived from a common computer-vision technique. The data output of this computer-vision analysis maps the wind’s turbulence onto moving fields of color.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/mgvwsadRzU7MiNLD6UE9ArBdsrD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Indirect","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2816767,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Lattanzi","original_name":"Barbara Lattanzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/77CdlZCkzTs2ZmJpZzCNNqTnMbx.jpg","credit_id":"62cb8f39e8d028004f1976a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":839,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mgvwsadRzU7MiNLD6UE9ArBdsrD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":559}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
