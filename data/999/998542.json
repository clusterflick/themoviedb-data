The frequency used is 528 Hz  Bell's theorem is a no-go theorem that draws an important distinction between quantum mechanics and the world as described by classical mechanics. In its simplest form, Bell's theorem states: No physical theory of local hidden variables can ever reproduce all of the predictions of quantum mechanics.  Bell inequalities concern measurements made by observers on pairs of particles that have interacted and then separated. Assuming local realism, certain constraints must hold on the relationships between the correlations between subsequent measurements of the particles under various possible measurement settings.  The video takes a poetic approach and follows two light particles that simultaneously coexist and influence each other throughout their journey.
