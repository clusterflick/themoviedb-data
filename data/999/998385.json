Throughout his rise to power and political career, Vladimir Putin has been an autocratic enigma.  He was reared in Soviet poverty, served as a KGB intelligence agent in East Germany, and through a series of cunning maneuvers, rose from deputy mayor of St. Petersburg to the presidency of post-Soviet Russia.  Zakaria gets answers to the many questions that surround Putin that have confounded leaders around the world, including at least four U.S. presidents: how did Putin’s mindset move from pro-global harmony, to isolation, fear, and loathing of the West.","popularity":0.3593,"poster_path":"/vlexG1omTFdajxIrF25wO2nXJO7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Fareed Zakaria hosts New CNN Special","title":"INSIDE THE MIND OF VLADIMIR PUTIN","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1227871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fareed Zakaria","original_name":"Fareed Zakaria","popularity":0.4278,"profile_path":"/mCUNZaL07a0XC4QhxMom7rh3Kol.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"62cb1f6746aed4087e86e83c","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt20240746","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zrl0PpoGkmJFjn4cre10xxUCYdx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/90RZOuxCYNsN9Ae4ALBXwGu8Jcm.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vlexG1omTFdajxIrF25wO2nXJO7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
