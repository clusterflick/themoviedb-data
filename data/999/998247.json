He had no way of knowing that his life would be turned upside down by then. To transport hundreds of thousands supporters to the football stadium, a new rail line is being developed to run straight through his neighborhood. Houses are being demolished, entire families are forced to move and even the children’s local football pitch will soon disappear. For Gabriel this is a nightmare. He is angry at the inequality in his city and posts self-made footage of bulldozers tearing down his neighborhood on a blog. By becoming a journalist he tries to stand up for his rights.","popularity":0.0679,"poster_path":"/tBi1PVrOyEvJMbJApFjzxu03rrR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2014-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gabriel Reports on the World Cup","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223868,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Stefano Bertacchini","original_name":"Stefano Bertacchini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62cada0f05f9cf004c84262f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1341098,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Els van Riel","original_name":"Els van Riel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62cad9fc90b87e07572219d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3618644,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Francesco Indaco","original_name":"Francesco Indaco","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62cada1e05f9cf004fdea3ad","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4275736","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/tBi1PVrOyEvJMbJApFjzxu03rrR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"informal date","release_date":"2014-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
