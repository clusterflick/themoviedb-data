Fans in Dallas are squarely behind the Doomsday Defense. Minnesota had the Purple People Eaters, while Chicago had the 46. Still, in 2000, the Baltimore Ravens were as good as any in that group, and possibly even better. br br Statistically speaking, the Ravens' defense was without equal. Led by Pro Bowlers Ray Lewis, Sam Adams and Rod Woodson, Baltimore allowed the fewest points ever in a 16-game season - 165, an average of just over 10 per contest. Amazingly, they played even better in the postseason, allowing just 16 points combined in wins over the Broncos, Titans and Raiders.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/pAlpufE321cjlgNRjEaZ5oqLFfF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4575,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vivendi Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":476,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"NFL Greatest Games Series 2000 Baltimore Ravens","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.721,"height":1110,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pAlpufE321cjlgNRjEaZ5oqLFfF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.721,"height":763,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lQE4dNz7x3muQNWzfOqTz0Lezzu.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":550},{"aspect_ratio":0.721,"height":1705,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lwr8XUwiJlik7UO6y9vXNZ3ZubS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1229}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
