She is given responsibility to prepare a group of teen drop-outs for confirmation.  Instead, a confrontation over morality presses Mrs. Murphy to articulate convictions she didnâ€™t know she had.  This leads to a crisis of faith, and a shamefully exhilarating private moment.  A playful and distinctive short film that portrays an awkward journey, and raises taboo questions with no thought of delicacy.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/nW6OwbwDzrVGAFWcUrdMgUHc377.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mrs. Murphy's Confession","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2059752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Turri","original_name":"Ryan Turri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b1a0f999251414bc60110cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nW6OwbwDzrVGAFWcUrdMgUHc377.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
