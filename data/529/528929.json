He was already the voice from the void; he was James the Boptist, a hard-partying rock ‘n’ roller that pioneered a new genre of Afrikaans rock music (despite being English) that sparked and fired a revolution. He was working with heavy-hitters William Kentridge and Warrick Sony on Faustus in Africa, staged in Grahamstown in 1995.  This is a rollicking musical ride through all these incarnations, with frank insights from 80’s and 90’s musicians and leftie luminaries – from Johannes Kerkorrel to Lloyd Ross, Pieter-Dirk Uys to Zapiro by way of the Radio Rats’ Jonathan Handley and Vusi Mahlasela.  It’s an intimate portrait of a wildly talented poet painted by those who knew him best.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/AjkwGs33GDMGjSXnJwoOT4EfYiY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fun's Not Over: The James Phillips Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5lW9xpQhazORsZXbVuckRj1BM3o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fIBtrwOvX96Mg4MKt7yRqV62QvE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sU4p2N2uT13TOdJhZQDZRC1k0bG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AjkwGs33GDMGjSXnJwoOT4EfYiY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1079}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Encounters South African International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2018-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"THE FUN'S NOT OVER - The James Phillips Story\" (Preview)","key":"WOI-7zByQrM","published_at":"2018-04-02T19:51:01.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5b50c2390e0a264136013939"}]}}}
