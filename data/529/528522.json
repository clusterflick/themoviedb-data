Actor, Shimon Yisraeli, himself a pioneer of one-man shows on Israeli stages, wrote and spearheaded this one-man film which tells the story of Holocaust survivor, Emmanuel, who works as a security guard on a construction site where he grapples with all the memories of those dark times that come flooding back: the train journey, the Dachau death camp, his murdered paramour, and his former friend, Hans, who joined the Nazis and killed his father. He shows up at his childhood home where Hans now lives: following an encounter with a vicious dog, Emmanuel finds shelter in the house cellar where he bides his time – remembering, hallucinating, and working up an appetite for revenge. The Cellar won the Best Feature Film Suitable for Young People award at the Berlin International Film Festival.","popularity":0.0509,"poster_path":"/gdO3PiJ2mdOxMYn20EKN3y9Hc9C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":249801,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shay Films Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"1963-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cellar","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5171549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shimon Yisraeli","original_name":"Shimon Yisraeli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Emmanuel","credit_id":"6781a1e83881c79419bb80af","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3448234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Smadar","original_name":"David Smadar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Hans","credit_id":"6781a2203881c79419bb80d3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":55058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zaharira Harifai","original_name":"Zaharira Harifai","popularity":0.0798,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Lotte (Voice)","credit_id":"6781a28790f42c32837aed5c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5171554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannah Kahane","original_name":"Hannah Kahane","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Lotte","credit_id":"6781a2ca78cfcd77ed4e7d4d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1504185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Natan Gross","original_name":"Natan Gross","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7f12d72dc44e0011fd0de2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5171549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shimon Yisraeli","original_name":"Shimon Yisraeli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6781a32b78cfcd77ed4e7d7d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5171566,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yaakov Malkin","original_name":"Yaakov Malkin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6781a36cbd793c03544e4b68","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5171569,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nachum Slonim","original_name":"Nachum Slonim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6781a3ac38817437e2bb32bd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5171577,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Yaakov Jonilowicz","original_name":"Yaakov Jonilowicz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6781a42838817437e2bb3314","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5171549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shimon Yisraeli","original_name":"Shimon Yisraeli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6781a517c5d2e96e267b5290","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5171589,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eddy Halpern","original_name":"Eddy Halpern","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6781a5802b29a918d04e92d2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0057123","wikidata_id":"Q19799504","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.683,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/gdO3PiJ2mdOxMYn20EKN3y9Hc9C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":683},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/gSOXDODFKA1dVwbj1S8sb66vAno.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1963-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
