Fed up with the noise and fumes from cars, DePoe staged a 3-day sit in where the Diggers peacefully occupied the street to petition the Toronto City Council to get what they wanted. To their surprise, the police were ordered to remove them by force by the city officials who wanted to keep the street open as a necessary traffic artery. After being released from jail, DePoe and his group were invited by the fiercely conservative and patronizing Allan Lamport, a member of the Board of Control and former Mayor of the city to a meeting at City Hall to present their case. The climactic battle unfolded there between Lamport and DePoe, who was representing the Canadian Youth Council.","popularity":0.4486,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flowers on a One-Way Street","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":621794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Spry","original_name":"Robin Spry","popularity":0.142,"profile_path":"/tZ99dhOqCaeSMrf4rHaNQ7c8hTo.jpg","credit_id":"5b1758c1c3a368533a017c2d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":621794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Spry","original_name":"Robin Spry","popularity":0.142,"profile_path":"/tZ99dhOqCaeSMrf4rHaNQ7c8hTo.jpg","credit_id":"5b1758ac0e0a262dd301cd57","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2470485,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joseph Koenig","original_name":"Joseph Koenig","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c6b54a5b1d8d48c504dcb9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1354857,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Douglas Kiefer","original_name":"Douglas Kiefer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c6b5560111a88c6b04d8d5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1301812,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Christopher Cordeaux","original_name":"Christopher Cordeaux","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c6b57a5b1d8d48c504dcdd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0225760","wikidata_id":"Q123289226","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3793,"name":"road traffic"},{"id":220658,"name":"local politics"},{"id":286881,"name":"street protest"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1968-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
