Years after\r giving up all hope of finding medical help, an accidental meeting with a reporter’s brother leads\r to a national television story on Ganesh’s facial deformity. The resulting media sensation draws\r the interest of India’s rich and powerful, and a Canadian plastic surgeon, Dr. Sanjeev Kaila, who\r changes their lives forever. Acclaimed feature filmmaker Srinivas Krishna (Masala, Lulu) makes\r his documentary debut with this powerful and moving story about love, faith and hope.","popularity":0.1824,"poster_path":"/gDJfO1xhiyLYZs0vZP9sa4f7eAR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":64829,"logo_path":null,"name":"Inner City Films","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2009-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ganesh, Boy Wonder","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1243310,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stephen J.
