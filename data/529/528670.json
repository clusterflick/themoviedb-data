He is bored on his father's farm. He would love to see something of the world and find a woman to marry. So he sets off and wants to visit his grandmother at the same time. However, the route takes him right through the fairytale land of the Brothers Grimm, where he meets various characters from their stories: Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Rumpelstiltskin, Mother Hulda, the Brave Little Tailor, Puss in Boots, Master Pfriem and, finally, Father Death. The latter is a little under the weather and the unsuspecting Hans helps him back on his feet.","popularity":0.3749,"poster_path":"/9I0ln6yBK5NJJtlQPBN49rmnDn1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85185,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wizzard
