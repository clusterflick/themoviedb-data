Internationally, the power of his work is now more profound than ever. Blockbuster exhibitions, the novel and movie ‘Girl with a pearl earring’ caught a broad audience. Millions are touched by his work. What do we see in Vermeer that makes him so contemporary? The dignity of his painted ladies, the cinematic and photographic character of his images, the psychological impact, the serenity or apparent glimpse in our own everyday life? Influential contemporary artists, photographers and opinion leaders unravel the extraordinary and mysterious impact of this 17th century master in our day and age.","popularity":0.1505,"poster_path":"/1uL7tyeu2f6zbF5AftcBe9pc2sq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73348,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lagestee Film BV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2010-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Views on Vermeer - 12 Short Stories","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1506657,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"tim van peppen","original_name":"tim van peppen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b173852c3a368534f01ce38","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2058523,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jacques Spaans","original_name":"Jacques Spaans","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b173788c3a3685333020f62","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2058525,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Koos de Wilt","original_name":"Koos de Wilt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b1737b10e0a262dc701d917","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1265170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans Pool","original_name":"Hans Pool","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b1736aa0e0a262dcc020a7b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1980074,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maaik Krijgsman","original_name":"Maaik Krijgsman","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b173807925141782e01f0fa","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":105970,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Lagestee","original_name":"Martin Lagestee","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b1736cd0e0a262dcc020a92","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1265170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans Pool","original_name":"Hans Pool","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b1737c90e0a262dc701d91e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1903785,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jan Wouter Stam","original_name":"Jan Wouter Stam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b1738230e0a262df401c8a6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2759328","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1uL7tyeu2f6zbF5AftcBe9pc2sq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"Hot Docs 2010, Toronto","release_date":"2010-05-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Views on Vermeer","key":"Nrgyx8bX-zc","published_at":"2010-04-23T17:55:18.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"5b173a48c3a3685349021b88"}]}}}
