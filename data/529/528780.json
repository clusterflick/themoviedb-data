Igor Stravinsky lived in the heart of Hollywood from 1939 until shortly before his death in 1971 - longer than in any other single place. He came expecting to find lucrative work composing for the movies. The film uses a combination of existing archival footage (some of it never before seen), interviews with Stravinsky and his assistant Robert Craft. The documentary includes scenes from several big studio films of the 40s brought together for the first time with the music which Stravinsky wrote for them.","popularity":0.1076,"poster_path":"/z8UoKTYMoucGaSU8yc9dudfUvuy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Genius springs eternal","title":"Stravinsky in Hollywood","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":974330,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Igor Stravinsky","original_name":"Игорь Стравинский","popularity":0.1956,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5b192fd69251414ba800498e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1914163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vera de Bosset","original_name":"Vera de Bosset","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5b19301b9251414bb8008098","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1914156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Craft","original_name":"Robert Craft","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5b19302cc3a36848ff008abd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1248654,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"George Balanchine","original_name":"George Balanchine","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5b1930999251414bd4006535","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1574000,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marco Capalbo","original_name":"Marco Capalbo","popularity":0.0769,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self - Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5b1930b00e0a261f800065cc","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1574000,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marco Capalbo","original_name":"Marco Capalbo","popularity":0.0769,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b192cbcc3a36848fb00641a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1574000,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marco Capalbo","original_name":"Marco Capalbo","popularity":0.0769,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b192c8ac3a36849040068da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3813336","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i3xvsGzjLyRjqLayDnwP3LU5wOo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/z8UoKTYMoucGaSU8yc9dudfUvuy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-06-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
