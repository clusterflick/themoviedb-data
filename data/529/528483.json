Characterized by movement that is barely possible, incoherent, or without apparent motivation, it is a deliberately broken or failed animation. The body here becomes something unpredictable and unknown, unattached from the usual meanings, but also seems to feel more intensely. The result is an unsettling and ambiguous immediacy that is identified with both suffering and pleasure.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/veA9iwhBCl3IHVX2a37cjmyVZS2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Full Service Automation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2058322,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darya Farha","original_name":"Darya Farha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b16e2850e0a262df101aa83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.655,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/veA9iwhBCl3IHVX2a37cjmyVZS2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":983}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
