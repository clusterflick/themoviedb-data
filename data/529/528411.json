Co-director Joachim Trier appears onscreen alongside Knausgaard as they visit several key locations from the celebrated painter’s life, searching for insights into his imagination and vision as they discuss his vastly influential oeuvre, his themes and obsessions, his approach to rendering everyday things and strongly emotional scenes alike. Knausgaard’s interpretation of Munch proves to be captivatingly unorthodox, and the Trier brothers thrillingly seek to connect his thoughts about the painter to his own literary project, yielding a double portrait of two of Norway’s most essential artists.
