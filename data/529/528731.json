In this feature documentary, his journey to find his place in soul music history takes you from vinyl to virtual—and back again. His voice has been compared to James Brown, but Lee Fields is no knock-off. He’s the real thing. For decades, he thought his music dreams were dead. But with one phone call, everything changed … Interspersed with striking, never-before seen performances of new and classic Lee Fields songs, the film takes us through Lee’s memories from the moment soul music began, to his hard-won present-day success, and shows how 50 years of changing technology have conspired to create one beautiful but fleeting moment in music history.","popularity":0.1036,"poster_path":"/ljBbA1h8cLlC9o40ODuFFElFrQr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
