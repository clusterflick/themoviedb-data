Each shift begets a kind of origin story: one encounter traces the specific azure of a James Turrell installation to a pet shop jellyfish, in another, a modern-day putto purifies a horrific tale by blowing bubbles in a tub. Sister City, like water, seeks its own level; cresting and displacing continuous bursts of life spiritualized, succulent, and ultimately alone.  -Deirtra Thompson","popularity":0.0682,"poster_path":"/jqfyCQTjv7ATWgCXu3K3LEN0UIG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sister City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1375653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dani ReStack","original_name":"Dani ReStack","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b13e64c0e0a263dd400fa90","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jqfyCQTjv7ATWgCXu3K3LEN0UIG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":766}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
