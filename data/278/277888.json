Few could guess the degree to which Huston's documentaries would depict the sheer brutality and horror of modern warfare - particularly his Let There Be Light and The Battle of San Pietro. The films served (by default) as cinematic protests, even as they graced new and brilliant heights within the scope of American documentary. (Indeed, Light was banned by the government for 35 years). Midge Mackenzie's 1998 documentary John Huston: War Stories explores this little known facet of Huston's career, intercutting clips from the various documentaries with a Huston interview shot just prior to his death.","popularity":0.8795,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Huston War Stories","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1332732,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Midge Mackenzie","original_name":"Midge Mackenzie","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53a5d96f0e0a261449001ae5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0475095","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2903,"name":"propaganda"},{"id":12396,"name":"hollywood"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
