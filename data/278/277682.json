But once they did...they had no way back. When Baltic states regain their independence from the Soviet Union, thousands of Russians living outside Russia find themselves cut off from their native land. Some of them return to Russia, others become naturalized citizens and go on with their lives in the new country. However, two Russian brothers, Kostya and Yura, are among those who do not want to return to Russia, nor to live under the new government. When brothers find out that they must leave the country or will be deported, they decide to challenge the government that they believe has violated their rights. The brothers capture a minivan full of passengers and demand a ransom of a million dollars as a compensation for the injustice inflicted upon them. According to their plan, none of the hostages will be hurt, however, as the brothers capture the minivan, the first blood spilled.","popularity":0.1341,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anastasia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1241181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vytautas Kernagis","original_name":"Vytautas Kernagis","popularity":0.0626,"profile_path":"/vqA55KAforFFG4loORIzo10RzXW.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Doctor","credit_id":"53a44d48c3a3682a4e0010e9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1331373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonardas Pobedonoscevas","original_name":"Leonardas Pobedonoscevas","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/jGmvYSO9dyM4nH11PlIoLgWIo1h.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Junior","credit_id":"53a44d59c3a3682a3c0011e8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1261515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vytautas Sapranauskas","original_name":"Vytautas Šapranauskas","popularity":0.3399,"profile_path":"/wBbhgi4wrpODfLg7DjEfDpJlFEP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Watchman","credit_id":"53a44d68c3a3682a4b001256","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1190206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donatas Banionis","original_name":"Донатас Банионис","popularity":0.1731,"profile_path":"/vz0TKZFu1qW5HZFhvIi0JZG9W7D.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Doctor's father","credit_id":"53a44d78c3a3682a4b001259","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1339352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mantas Vaitiekūnas","original_name":"Mantas Vaitiekūnas","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":"/wjKq5sCSa8mioWSe27UHRYxZNvm.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Policeman II","credit_id":"53bcf85cc3a3684cf9000e38","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117763,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Māris Martinsons","original_name":"Māris Martinsons","popularity":0.0762,"profile_path":"/85JZT5WJd6BmIw3KUE30p3ukQdU.jpg","credit_id":"53a44de3c3a3682a450011e4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117763,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Māris Martinsons","original_name":"Māris Martinsons","popularity":0.0762,"profile_path":"/85JZT5WJd6BmIw3KUE30p3ukQdU.jpg","credit_id":"53a44dd4c3a3682a4e0010fc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0776759","wikidata_id":"Q12648305","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
