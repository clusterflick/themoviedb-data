Finally only one man, Private Russo, is left, in the midst of a mine field, together with a German officer, locked in a stalemate. Russo has water, while the German claims to have a map revealing the mine positions. So Russo agrees to swap water for the map, but the German officer tries to double-cross him.  This was Burt Topper's debut film, made on 16mm on weekends together with some friends in Indio, California. It was also Wally Campo's debut film, as well as script supervisor Joyce King's.","popularity":0.7032,"poster_path":"/qe4j1QLdeM1UIy3GZtox7AvQlV4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25424,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rhonda Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":9266,"logo_path":"/lRinQ7scVye5N8qkUIoCB4QXbRh.png","name":"American International Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1958-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hits Like Steel!","title":"Hell Squad","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"El escuadr√≥n del infierno","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wally Campo","original_name":"Wally Campo","popularity":0.126,"profile_path":"/iUjjJZFyvQsY2OKzPZtJkGDXxVn.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Private Russo","credit_id":"53a18d4fc3a3687b9800288e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandon Carroll","original_name":"Brandon Carroll","popularity":0.0773,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Lt.
