They inevitably broaden, as their momentum builds into a celebration of the game itself - its vigour, its humour, its spirit and perhaps above all, its friendships. No-one knows how to celebrate these things better than Max.  Max Boyce holds a unique place in the affections of rugby followers as someone whose love for the game – and for Welsh rugby in particular, however it happens to be faring - helps define the kind of entertainer he is and the very special world he invites us to enter.  It’s a world audiences have embraced with total delight over three decades of best-selling albums, hit television shows and sell-out live performances. You name it and Max has done it. Now he can add the Sydney Opera House to his list of conquests.","popularity":0.1104,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"2003 concert from the Sydney Opera House, Australia","title":"Max Boyce Down Under","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1249900,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Boyce","original_name":"Max Boyce","popularity":0.0839,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"53a5bee1c3a3687a34001747","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5657,"name":"australia"},{"id":9716,"name":"stand-up comedy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
