The film vividly exposes a monstrous and unconstitutional \"deep state\" in which multiple competing chains of command -- all but one illegal -- hijack government capabilities and taxpayer funds to commit crimes against humanity in our name. Anyone who cares about democracy, good government, and the future will want to watch all five segments of this remarkable film.\" - Robert David STEELE Vivas: CIA, USMC, OSS, Earth Intelligence Network and Founder, Phi Beta Iota the Public Intelligence Blog","popularity":0.0729,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":300,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Shining a Light on Black Operations","title":"Counter-Intelligence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":235230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Scott Noble","original_name":"Scott Noble","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61b5cabd21621b001d3a90b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
