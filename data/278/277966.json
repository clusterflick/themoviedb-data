This film features Terry 'Coyote' Murphy representing the Native American influence of the isle of Manhattan. Coyote, a Shaman Trail Scout, takes a journey which transcends time, weaving from Inwood Park (where the island was traded for beads &amp; booze), down a long native path (now called 'the great white way', more commonly known as 'Broadway'), to the lower reaches of Manhattan into 'ground zero' (which is now a sacred burial ground for not just the American Indian &amp; the slaves of yesteryear, but for the newest natives of this island empire as well).","popularity":0.1171,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A journey which transcends time","title":"Native New Yorker","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1639243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terry 'Coyote' Murphy","original_name":"Terry 'Coyote' Murphy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Shaman Trail Scout","credit_id":"576991d692514117a60003e6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1639244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John 'Pope' Paul","original_name":"John 'Pope' Paul","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Native Scout","credit_id":"576991e3925141157800043f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1639246,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"William Susman","original_name":"William Susman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"576991fec3a3683370000454","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":670394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Bilich","original_name":"Steve Bilich","popularity":0.1149,"profile_path":"/bvajCo57g4TsY63UCdSh06scMeB.jpg","credit_id":"576991f1c3a36836ed0003a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0458439","wikidata_id":"Q6980040","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
