This short film walks the viewer through art directors' responsibilities and the demands on their talents. They read a script carefully and design a set to capture the time and place, the social strata, and the mood. They must be scholars of the history of architecture, furnishings, and fashion. They choose the colors on a set in anticipation of the lighting and the mood. Their work also sets styles, from Art Deco in the 20's to 30s modernism. Then it's on to the next project.  Preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2012.","popularity":0.8091,"poster_path":"/57b5sX4bRqKvkaVBXYL627R2Mpp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43330,"logo_path":null,"name":"Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1949-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Art Director","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dana Andrews","original_name":"Dana Andrews","popularity":0.6177,"profile_path":"/gTZaqIS441ejTsQmfZff6SHvWja.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self (archive footage) (uncredited)","credit_id":"5b582f0ec3a3685c9704d450","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronald Colman","original_name":"Ronald Colman","popularity":0.4218,"profile_path":"/2Rw0UG4QLk8cDCTGZZ5RxFK1e41.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self -
