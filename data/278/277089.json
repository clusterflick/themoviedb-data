However, the strange and unearthly beauty of Beatrice (Kathleen Beller) masks a terrifying curse which Giovanni must tragically discover. Her father, the mysterious Dr. Rappaccini, has made her the subject of a diabolical experiment. In Giovanni's attempt to free Beatrice from the control of her father and to escape the poisonous effect she begins to have on him, he unwittingly destroys her. From the short story of master American novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne, two quintessential Hawthorne themes are explored: the sins of interfering with another's soul and the futility of trying to tamper with nature.","popularity":1.2273,"poster_path":"/oYgSni4fGQlwOgs6IDoT7yGwCCb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97404,"logo_path":null,"name":"Learning in Focus","origin_country":""},{"id":212759,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seacliff Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rappaccini's Daughter","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristoffer Tabori","original_name":"Kristoffer Tabori","popularity":0.2785,"profile_path":"/AfjcxSyRzF4l2jP5YjGfTwaOdoE.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Giovanni","credit_id":"585b96fe9251416fad089d2b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":76064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathleen Beller","original_name":"Kathleen Beller","popularity":0.4424,"profile_path":"/vhJMUW99Jka8ISQc3Po0BPAAGE4.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Beatrice","credit_id":"585b970c9251416f630933bb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":171189,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Egan","original_name":"Michael Egan","popularity":0.0628,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Baglioni","credit_id":"585b9739925141724d05fa68","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonardo Cimino","original_name":"Leonardo Cimino","popularity":0.2284,"profile_path":"/htS7uDanNvj66rQMCl9ff09L0Pe.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Rappaccini","credit_id":"585b974ec3a36827a5082f29","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1194429,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonia Rey","original_name":"Antonia Rey","popularity":0.1733,"profile_path":"/9brQ4cySacsKJnSiWPtGWE9oqVf.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Emma","credit_id":"6546e26bd55c3d00abfe18c2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4358230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madeline Willemsen","original_name":"Madeline Willemsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Lisabetta","credit_id":"6546e2789cc67b00c443a19f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Boutsikaris","original_name":"Dennis Boutsikaris","popularity":0.6635,"profile_path":"/eholEaSnVKzse1l7ph6hDsfTTi7.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Vito","credit_id":"6546e2835c071b00e766041e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4358232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Coqui González","original_name":"Coqui González","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Flower Seller","credit_id":"6546e2909cc67b00fc802b54","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Fonda","original_name":"Henry Fonda","popularity":1.2023,"profile_path":"/6wXWsqSXF3wCsGcwVqiszy6RX9X.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self -
