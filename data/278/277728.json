For as long as he could remember, twelve year old Tom Canty had dreamed of being a Prince. Whenever he was not begging for money for his cruel father, Tom played \"being Prince\" with his friends. Tom Canty and Prince Edward, the soon to be king, bear a striking resemblance to one another and decide to swap places. Unfortunately, the once innocent trick turns into a nightmare, and the Pauper and the Prince become desperate in their struggle to prove their real identity before it is too late and the Pauper is crowned King.","popularity":0.3229,"poster_path":"/wjWiq2NdaOyda7rIHK6bPO0CTLy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":69644,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blye Migicovsky Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":69643,"logo_path":null,"name":"Phoenix Animation Studios","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":69645,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jaffa Road Management Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Prince and the Pauper","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Prince and the Pauper","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1236889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Glen","original_name":"Edward Glen","popularity":0.0844,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"65f6c5a2eb79c2016352a067","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":123304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colette Stevenson","original_name":"Colette Stevenson","popularity":0.2645,"profile_path":"/cw8MZts1nwxvq0xuijEuKTklApA.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"65f6c5dbe21023017eee5e2f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1232983,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Shekter","original_name":"Mark Shekter","popularity":0.0638,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f6bc7a66469a016479f33a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2197887,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rick Allen","original_name":"Rick Allen","popularity":0.0418,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f6bfe4e194b0017cbea70e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1232983,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Shekter","original_name":"Mark Shekter","popularity":0.0638,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b791db9925141295f022ac4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1232982,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Garry Blye","original_name":"Garry Blye","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b791e60c3a36860df02666e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2461830","wikidata_id":"Q65215551","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1136,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nKhAq3UMkc3AM0H1amN7zwcABQO.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2020},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1166,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y2E4VPS4FzIgQqyHIZWtUsPDyYJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2073}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wjWiq2NdaOyda7rIHK6bPO0CTLy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":527},{"aspect_ratio":0.695,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3jVT9hCkFexIpmgjufmpfg5cfoe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":695}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
