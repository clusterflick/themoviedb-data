It also made films depicting Iran's progress and modernization, highlighting the role of the Shah and NIOC in that direction. Under its auspices, Ebrahim Golestan directed A FIRE (1961), a highly visual treatment of a seventy-day oil well fire in the Khuzestan region of southwestern Iran. This film was edited by the Iranian poet Forough Farrokhzad and won two awards at the Venice Film Festival in 1961.","popularity":0.3958,"poster_path":"/tTgdBDnOePosZR8xDI247L5jqvR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72152,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Golestan","origin_country":""},{"id":75427,"logo_path":null,"name":"Golestan-Film","origin_country":""},{"id":163619,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"1961-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Fire","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","title":"Yek atash","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1128485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ebrahim Golestan","original_name":"Ebrahim Golestan","popularity":0.1049,"profile_path":"/fRX25Y4CQJ4tQivoLrbBuQG3n7p.jpg","credit_id":"53a3f4a1c3a3682a36000b76","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1174367,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Forugh Farrokhzad","original_name":"Forugh Farrokhzad","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":"/vofBBmDcfVE3EWWjlCziM2lAzD0.jpg","credit_id":"53a3f4b2c3a3682a4b000b87","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1128485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ebrahim Golestan","original_name":"Ebrahim Golestan","popularity":0.1049,"profile_path":"/fRX25Y4CQJ4tQivoLrbBuQG3n7p.jpg","credit_id":"634dbcf8e263bb009c504354","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1128485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ebrahim Golestan","original_name":"Ebrahim Golestan","popularity":0.1049,"profile_path":"/fRX25Y4CQJ4tQivoLrbBuQG3n7p.jpg","credit_id":"634dbd221089ba0082f09259","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1604865,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Shahrokh Golestan","original_name":"Shahrokh Golestan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e19ac2cb3f6f50014d4f911","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0495776","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.695,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tTgdBDnOePosZR8xDI247L5jqvR.jpg","vote_average":2.278,"vote_count":3,"width":834},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fa","file_path":"/lsNnzRj3HGMAsFf2HnmP7LGtOUx.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":4,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":201386,"name":"drilling for oil"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1961-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Venice International Film Festival","release_date":"1961-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
