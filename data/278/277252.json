The story follows Chip through the streets of Columbus, Ohio as he struggles to break out of the shackles of his failed attempt at a stand-up comedy career. Just when it looks like he gets the chance of his life to headline a comedy festival, his paranoia gets the best of him and he shoots himself in the foot just like he has always done in the past. He might be obscure to the general public but within the world of stand-up comedy he is loved by few and hated by many.","popularity":1.8287,"poster_path":"/8uta8QAECwu4ffxTc0sbiywS4cG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"What if Jerry Seinfeld had a cokehead comedian brother?","title":"Who the F#ck Is Chip Seinfeld?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1331474,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jake Iannarino","original_name":"Jake Iannarino","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Chip","credit_id":"53a099d00e0a2665370003fe","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1331475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Gage","original_name":"Jeff Gage","popularity":0.0851,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herb","credit_id":"53a09a070e0a26654b0003a5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3043235,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kate Queen","original_name":"Kate Queen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Velveeta","credit_id":"64d53e21db4ed600ad2463f7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4208087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Ramey","original_name":"Larry Ramey","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Junebug","credit_id":"64d53e29bf31f201ce679c0e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4208088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cr Weaver","original_name":"Cr Weaver","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64d53e31021cee00ae51770d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4208089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Travis Hoewischer","original_name":"Travis Hoewischer","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64d53e37b6c26411569a840c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":441567,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Adomian","original_name":"James Adomian","popularity":0.9492,"profile_path":"/uVefQ6KShDhgTeUKEDS4vDsLhq.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Corona Martini","credit_id":"64d53e3ebf31f201ca8ae647","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":170364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Papa","original_name":"Tom Papa","popularity":0.3132,"profile_path":"/hJv6L8PSzlPwLCx2D98lgVniXgF.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64d53e45d100b600ad9fec33","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1722859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Wilson","original_name":"Joe Wilson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64d53e54db4ed600e2b5b9e7","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":131727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Heffron","original_name":"John Heffron","popularity":0.0798,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64d53e60bf31f201ca8ae65b","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patton Oswalt","original_name":"Patton Oswalt","popularity":0.9896,"profile_path":"/skGzommLR2zE6uk1YQRFK71dOJ8.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64d53e9bb6c2641159583ac4","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":208685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Braunger","original_name":"Matt Braunger","popularity":0.4969,"profile_path":"/sW7orkmlxc0hpPWXHwDJRjAW100.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64d53ea2021cee011c8fbc85","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2790733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John F.
