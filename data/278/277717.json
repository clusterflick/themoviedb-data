She lives with her husband Donny, an architect, and spends all day reorganising her apartment and with other futilities. While the couple are very fond of each other, the agoraphobia and the physical discomfort are not without their consequences for the marriage. Yet neither of them takes the plunge and talks about the frustrations and the lack of sexual contact. Change comes to this tense, silent existence cut off from the world when Anne's half-sister Iris comes to visit from Israel. A teenager filled with energy and fun, who is however attracted to the withdrawn and secure lifestyle of Anne and Donny. She nestles into the house like a wasp in a bottle of beer, but her presence brings the couple's suppressed fears and desires at the surface.","popularity":0.0475,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Afraid of Everything","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathalie Richard","original_name":"Nathalie Richard","popularity":0.5334,"profile_path":"/299hXLV3NikHBGFm7J2iIO3c699.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"58ace2dfc3a3682ada001ca7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Aukin","original_name":"Daniel Aukin","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"58ace3bfc3a3682ada001d18","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":55047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Adler","original_name":"Sarah Adler","popularity":0.1467,"profile_path":"/eesKRerwrBWaCh00K2SjjUyDtOZ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"58ace4b69251411fb0001e74","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1763380,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Deborah Eve Lewis","original_name":"Deborah Eve Lewis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ace42f9251411fe1001db9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1763381,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stewart Wallace","original_name":"Stewart Wallace","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ace44dc3a3682b05001bf8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2035091,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Barker","original_name":"David Barker","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67549c8015159f48bcc7dd28","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0193706","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
