This school is located only about 20 minutes away from Hanazono Stadium, the mecca of Japan’s high school rugby, but it was not until 1994, 18 years after the foundation of a rugby team at the high school, that the Japanese education ministry approved the team’s entry into the official league.  Since then, the team has run in the national league as a representative of the Osaka area and been considered a front-runner ever since. The team has strong players and passionate supporters, but it faces difficulties just before winning the league.","popularity":0.4659,"poster_path":"/waNQBAzm2RrQXaVPLzQIMsWmago.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45370,"logo_path":"/9Ao9TsBhdKwE2cmaCFF69ACvEAz.png","name":"Indiestory","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2014-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One for All, All for One","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"60万回のトライ","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"60만번의 트라이","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1077269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moon Jeong-hee","original_name":"문정희","popularity":0.4503,"profile_path":"/6V48aFHytTUAHG9EJ5JObUEbXOV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Narrator","credit_id":"598ade62c3a36824a001d160","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1837938,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cho Eun-seong","original_name":"Cho Eun-seong","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65788192f04d0101009c7074","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1852041,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Park Sa-yu","original_name":"Park Sa-yu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"596a5f6392514136a4014b95","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1316840,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yoshihide Otomo","original_name":"大友良英","popularity":0.2426,"profile_path":"/eUUUsrlRIKvXIaeqBe4S6vZpbxv.jpg","credit_id":"642fd17231032500bd55b694","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1587580,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stanley Kwak","original_name":"곽용수","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4f71a59b861600166ba021","department":"Production","job":"Co-Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":2145,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/waNQBAzm2RrQXaVPLzQIMsWmago.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500},{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":2145,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/wHUARK4QGRmAXMAwkYEryN53Kiq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":270709,"name":"zainichi"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"One for All, All for One - Official Trailer","key":"2fDJ0n5ZUNo","published_at":"2014-09-18T06:02:16.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"598adbdfc3a36824a001ce73"}]}}}
