It was a job he would continue for the next twenty years until she was grown and he was able to save enough money to send all eight of his sons to America for education and career opportunities. The last time Danae saw Musa, in 1991, he proudly showed her the house he constructed in the Palestinian village of Battir. Then, against the mounting tensions of the Israeli occupation and the Palestinian Intifada, the two families lost track of each other. During that time Danae began to realize how much of an influence Musa had on her life and sought to reconnect with him. Her quest led her from her home in New York to Paterson, New Jersey, then to Battir in the occupied territories, and back to her birthplace in Jerusalem.","popularity":0.0836,"poster_path":"/mTyHeyLZb9MKGPSSEEUrs9jK9fv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Another Road Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1506139,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danae Elon","original_name":"Danae Elon","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b683370c3a368189d0bee36","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0457277","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mTyHeyLZb9MKGPSSEEUrs9jK9fv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
