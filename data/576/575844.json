It mines historical data, mingling it with speculative fictions, to chronicle different chapters embedded to the island's geological strata. Working with locals to ground the film's investigations within the myriad communities of Gotland, Smith seeks to re-imagine our modes of engagement with and contributions to ecological assemblages. Scanning the landscape characterised by palaeo-sea-stacks, fossil coastlines, concrete production plants and limestone quarries, the film focuses a lens on minerals circulated in economic, cultural and agricultural contexts.","popularity":0.0621,"poster_path":"/syPdvEotOJeV8QZ77rSiQAFks6P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United
