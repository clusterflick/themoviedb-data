The director – herself a descendant of the Raverdy family (and expecting her first child) – goes in search of the stories behind this sealed-off part of the city. She moves in with her 91-year-old grandmother, who lives over the road. Piece by piece, she is able to reconstruct events leading up to the factory’s closure, using old photos, advertising brochures, myths, language games, conversations with her grandmother and former female factory workers.  These memories unfold through different storylines. The factory’s surroundings are explored through a poetic film style, and the history of the nunnery next to the factory is also revealed. This sensitive film is a reflection on the invisible and the forgotten, revolving around women and the changing body.","popularity":0.136,"poster_path":"/6oqCZZkO65WgUkK2KfNU8OHHqVA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113597,"logo_path":null,"name":"Asbl Attelier Molloy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2018-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Behind the Shutters","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2219376,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Messaline Raverdy","original_name":"Messaline Raverdy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c40423ec3a36853ce415ee0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2219376,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Messaline Raverdy","original_name":"Messaline Raverdy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c4042550e0a2643d391f4f7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2219376,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Messaline Raverdy","original_name":"Messaline Raverdy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c404263925141344cb037be","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1724729,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier Dekegel","original_name":"Olivier Dekegel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c40426f92514156e5afe679","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1694460,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rudi Maerten","original_name":"Rudi Maerten","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c40427e9251416e06b037a6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2219381,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ivanne de Cannart","original_name":"Ivanne de Cannart","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c404287c3a36811b440d9e9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2219382,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miléna Trivier","original_name":"Miléna Trivier","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/dQ0VnNpinO7QfiMEV3gwRfcmYv6.jpg","credit_id":"5c404293925141344cb037f3","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1510134,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rémi Gérard","original_name":"Rémi Gérard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c4042a00e0a2646a2916548","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2219383,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hilde Nash","original_name":"Hilde Nash","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c4042abc3a36811b440da0b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9755804","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ctgXwHWd6dySQCfLW25uCGTTC8a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1240,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6oqCZZkO65WgUkK2KfNU8OHHqVA.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":868},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1018,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/79uaxiiDMvbpeKldIYlo0lnnkhW.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":679},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1vaSL2zNH2IXfmrSpk74c0NZMhD.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival de L'Acharnière","release_date":"2018-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
