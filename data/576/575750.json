It is about a meeting oftwo young people formatted by a culture of success with two men embodying a nihilistic and dematerialized vision of society. This work treads the fine line that separates the hero from the loser.. Are these two men messiahs or a pair of wandering vagrants? Is this descent on the river closer to a descent into the fires of hell or rather an initiatory journey?","popularity":0.4181,"poster_path":"/A2qqyqxGzdVyOlfjag5LN48ZhOx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99715,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pointligneplan","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2009-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La
