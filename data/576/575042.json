At the start, a baby rolls around on the floor of a living room and bounces in a standing jumper. This is followed by two separate bursts of frames in rapid succession, combining shots of children, parents, a rooster, buffalo, plants, scenes of what appears to be San Francisco, and much more. The longest stretch of the film then focuses on many children in a park on a sunny day: playing, climbing, and jumping. The exact date of production and location of the park scenes are unknown.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moody Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1911645,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"JoAnn Elam","original_name":"JoAnn Elam","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":"/lneCewkClL04eG0GAJdw8Hb3e0d.jpg","credit_id":"5c3c03fe0e0a2655c48ce76a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
