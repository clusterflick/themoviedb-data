While frequenting Kirk's gambling den, Molly meets Miles Rand, the dissolute son of Judge Rand, whose obvious attraction for her encourages Kirk to swindle him out of his money. Penniless, Miles accepts a loan from Molly and returns East to study law. On the day that Molly learns that her marriage is not legal, the gambling den burns down and Kirk is presumed dead. After escaping with Kirk's money, Molly goes East where she encounters Miles, now a district attorney. In spite of the objections of Judge Rand, Molly accepts Miles's proposal, but after Kirk arrives in town, she calls off the engagement. When Kirk enters her apartment through a window, Molly kills him in a panic and is arrested for murder. The still faithful Miles defends her in court, and after her acquittal, she confesses her past and reunites with her old love.","popularity":0.4044,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Judge Not; or The Woman of Mona Diggings","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":106555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Dean","original_name":"Julia Dean","popularity":0.1428,"profile_path":"/534F6JQ7ddkTrqbwGmymF18kDmf.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Molly Hanlon","credit_id":"5c412d250e0a2643d3934ff2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1182936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Carter","original_name":"Harry Carter","popularity":0.1734,"profile_path":"/im1zRe5qANuwhHlEaXTj5U0EKqQ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lee Kirk","credit_id":"5c412d89c3a36852d33c00be","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Carey","original_name":"Harry Carey","popularity":0.2712,"profile_path":"/AvNDsYjkLgeFHbxGFIFyl6QRgeM.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Miles Rand","credit_id":"5c412d979251416e2db18a6d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1391911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Robbins","original_name":"Marc Robbins","popularity":0.0813,"profile_path":"/vCCu2JK59TXzV8Iq4Udo4AnQUGY.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Judge Rand","credit_id":"5c412da5925141344cb18598","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1377921,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kingsley Benedict","original_name":"Kingsley Benedict","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/4Cb3qqvIRO2Lt5QZYHf2mgjP6bP.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Clarence Van Dyne","credit_id":"5c412db30e0a2633488ec47c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":997880,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Singleton","original_name":"Joseph Singleton","popularity":0.0672,"profile_path":"/ymLpb3sF8yIfuIEMZnUAzKLdgVo.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Minister","credit_id":"5c412dc3c3a3680573429408","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2220196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Machette","original_name":"Paul Machette","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Texas Joe","credit_id":"5c412dcec3a36824ea40e600","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1182938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lydia Yeamans Titus","original_name":"Lydia Yeamans Titus","popularity":0.0745,"profile_path":"/87nS94kb8JJvIBDBZYpFn0ELfo6.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Housekeeper","credit_id":"5c412de49251416e06b182fe","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2220197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Belasco","original_name":"Walter Belasco","popularity":0.0741,"profile_path":"/dia0tp1qKwzwV3p2qPq1EAJIJbF.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Barkeeper","credit_id":"5c412df19251415318b178d6","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":538370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hoot Gibson","original_name":"Hoot Gibson","popularity":0.5064,"profile_path":"/gtDdTrKTNy26xJVUeJpdFmZvZWf.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"622569798e2ba600440130cf","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93906,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Z.
