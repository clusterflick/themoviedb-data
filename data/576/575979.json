They smell great. They are full of wonderful things to eat, from crusty breads to gooey and sweet treats. And they often become neighborhood meeting places, where bakers work hard and where people often leave with good feelings as well as fresh baked goods. In this documentary, we celebrate A Few Great Bakeries across America, never claiming that this is a list of \"Best Bakeries\" but rather just a few warm ones worth checking out.  All of these places seem connected by early mornings, long hours of hard work, delicious products and customers who love them. We happily celebrate these few bakeries and hope that everyone will be inspired to look for more great ones all across America.","popularity":0.2799,"poster_path":"/4AwYM4G2SjJtulJJvwKcOHnuyV2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16021,"logo_path":"/2bjAiWiyI4nUWzxLcnGejDO0amC.png","name":"WQED","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A celebration of beautiful pastries & classic breads","title":"A Few Great Bakeries","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":974481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Sebak","original_name":"Rick Sebak","popularity":0.1465,"profile_path":"/8eYRrrzkY9co4nza7gP0hPwQ9Tb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5ed166f83dc313001fcd27b5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":974481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Sebak","original_name":"Rick Sebak","popularity":0.1465,"profile_path":"/8eYRrrzkY9co4nza7gP0hPwQ9Tb.jpg","credit_id":"5ed166995c071b001e2d44ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":974481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Sebak","original_name":"Rick Sebak","popularity":0.1465,"profile_path":"/8eYRrrzkY9co4nza7gP0hPwQ9Tb.jpg","credit_id":"5ed166a76e44bf001e169f59","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":974481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Sebak","original_name":"Rick Sebak","popularity":0.1465,"profile_path":"/8eYRrrzkY9co4nza7gP0hPwQ9Tb.jpg","credit_id":"5ecd70a4a579f9002006bbc0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rBPR5XE5Krm3JPsCe7VyPg4h49H.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jMF9xFqDpifRwAYQpFAkQaA7tix.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4AwYM4G2SjJtulJJvwKcOHnuyV2.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mBfdZJeeph72cqfunEmCw7PxvTS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7397,"name":"bakery"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
