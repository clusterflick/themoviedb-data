No one takes offense at the fact that the righteous woman has had an older count as a lover for years. For an evening together, the count brings a baron friend, his nephew Waldemar von Haldern and the actress Wanda. Waldemar, raised in a cold home, and the smart, solid Stine develop a deep, earnest affection for each other. The wise-beyond-life Mrs. Pittelkow does not look kindly on this ill-mannered union. She thinks that a light love affair is acceptable, but deep feelings cause pain. Despite all tradition, Waldemar wants to take Stine as his wife. The resistance of his family and Pauline drives him to take a momentous step.","popularity":0.2058,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1967-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Körber","original_name":"Maria Körber","popularity":0.201,"profile_path":"/uFUfcjrNGbjWff5BggpyDOjxTTc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Pauline Pittelkow","credit_id":"5c3fd1640e0a2638679153f4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1175272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilse Ritter","original_name":"Ilse Ritter","popularity":0.2393,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Stine","credit_id":"5c3fd170c3a368638a411aef","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1422568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Rüdiger","original_name":"Richard Rüdiger","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Waldemar von Haldern","credit_id":"5c3fd17f9251416e2dafddb8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1281765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilonka Rasch","original_name":"Ilonka Rasch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Olga Pittelkow","credit_id":"5c3fd18f925141344cafd9ec","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":40974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christiane Maybach","original_name":"Christiane Maybach","popularity":0.2237,"profile_path":"/2JXhJKlDWU3nAil5v7hOluhjifs.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Wanda Grützmacher","credit_id":"5c3fd19d9251416b02b00c88","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willi Rose","original_name":"Willi Rose","popularity":0.3601,"profile_path":"/3cgYlI7zHOKGkKxFaOumCXERnCH.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mr. Polzin","credit_id":"5c3fd1ae0e0a2655c4919953","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1193577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Caninenberg","original_name":"Hans Caninenberg","popularity":0.1021,"profile_path":"/eJquHvJuFPP0VDdS8cirdyFU8q0.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Count","credit_id":"5c3fd1ba0e0a26386791542f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Zesch-Ballot","original_name":"Hans Zesch-Ballot","popularity":0.0787,"profile_path":"/eQweBdkFezPHAbKMHX4JACXgDK1.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Baron","credit_id":"5c3fd1c50e0a2615548fc6f1","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10615,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Theodor Fontane","original_name":"Theodor Fontane","popularity":0.233,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6478bb7e17497301186fa3bc","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1487471,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Peter Scharff","original_name":"Peter Scharff","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6478bb9e0e29a200dcb9a8ae","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4091921,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Traugott Krischke","original_name":"Traugott Krischke","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6478bb8917497300de651535","department":"Writing","job":"Teleplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1897870,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joachim Faber","original_name":"Joachim Faber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6478bb93e323f300a7d46f20","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":11926,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Ilse Dubois","original_name":"Ilse Dubois","popularity":0.0981,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6478bba70e29a200bf1da186","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":26826,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wilm ten Haaf","original_name":"Wilm ten Haaf","popularity":0.0877,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c3fd1550e0a2643d3918104","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1262070","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":220,"name":"berlin, germany"},{"id":818,"name":"based on novel or book"},{"id":12999,"name":"black and white"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1967-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
