This is a home movie domestic comedy experimental film drama. Autobiography too. It’s also part four of an ever-growing trilogy.  Starting in 2003 I decided to make a series of pieces alongside my regular films, a strand that would constitute an ongoing fictional autobiography. But as all creative work is, to some extent, autobiographical, and as I appear in most of my films, and all the people in these films are who they say they are, then what made this different from the rest – or from real life, really – became kind of blurred. Fuzzy even.  So this is fuzzy fiction – latest in the line.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/ulUp7yz2uuOu7SywG04YDjfZJMj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Popular Touch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2219280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Tarragó","original_name":"Paul Tarragó","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c3ff587c3a368694e411743","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ulUp7yz2uuOu7SywG04YDjfZJMj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
