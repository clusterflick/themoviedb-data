Their daughter Malika drowned in the village river, seven years ago, according to their belief, but in reality she left with a man. Only Mohamed, her husband, knows the truth.  Death will come, in the guise of a beautiful woman wearing white, bringing anxiety to this peaceful home; she comes to pick up Mohamed, this one will be spared by the children... That night, Mohamed reports from the river a young stranger, Hiba, who will replace little by little Malika...  ... During the festival of Achoura, Death returns.
