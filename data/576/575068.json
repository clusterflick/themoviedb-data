On a hot December, the two brothers, María and Santiago, seduced by the same man, go through their sexual awakening with pain in a Christian universe that surrounds them. Framed in the transition of the nineties and the new millennium, the mystical family transits between a grim house in a Buenos Aires’ suburb neighbourhood and the Catholic school attended by the children. The house is invaded by a strange presence, perversity looks like beauty and a new sainthood is discovered.","popularity":0.2848,"poster_path":"/aR6uEmQ2oPqQyivNDrISMBmasye.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Saints","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4664365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franco Stella","original_name":"Franco Stella","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"María","credit_id":"6623814d197de4017d2a3aec","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4664366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalia Canaro","original_name":"Natalia Canaro","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Madre","credit_id":"6623817ae295b40164996f58","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2407912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lion Bagnis","original_name":"Lion Bagnis","popularity":0.0949,"profile_path":"/wK9zRzVMeo2SNkcMSC42QYwQLIR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Santiago","credit_id":"662381b1221ba60149123192","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2216899,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alejo Fraile","original_name":"Alejo Fraile","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6623810cb9a0bd017ad4a7a4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2216899,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alejo Fraile","original_name":"Alejo Fraile","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c3c221e0e0a263c4f8cdde8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8788364","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3YIwFp5bZTfOhElv5ioc7b8uOUp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/aR6uEmQ2oPqQyivNDrISMBmasye.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n0ZoBOTHWiKA7sVfLTkyaOPt0kM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.681,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/irnCsraD27ynwS7OYYpFvkJocvl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":511}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
