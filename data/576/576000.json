Janet has always dreamed of a career on the stage, but never had the chance. One day she meets Geoffrey Allen, a theatrical agent, and decides to try her luck at becoming an actress. However, when her husband Mark finds out, he orders her out of the house and keeps their daughter, Marcia. Moreover, her acting career sputters to a halt, and Geoffrey Allen takes advantage of her situation to make her his mistress. Years later she finds out that Marcia has become an actress--and that she, too, has become involved with Geoffrey.","popularity":0.4683,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":112166,"logo_path":null,"name":"Triumph Films (II)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ransom","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"She Pays","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":106555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Dean","original_name":"Julia Dean","popularity":0.1428,"profile_path":"/534F6JQ7ddkTrqbwGmymF18kDmf.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Janet Osborne","credit_id":"5c412f1fc3a36859f543040a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1817797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Huff","original_name":"Louise Huff","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/bwiPE5BqqYW4DFNdiVnMc1UpBnr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Marcia Osborne","credit_id":"5c412f2b0e0a2633488ec61f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1223540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethel Lloyd","original_name":"Ethel Lloyd","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":"/kOpcebL6udnr4CqP4h5GWhCz2b0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sarah Osborne","credit_id":"5c412f449251416b02b1a400","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2220206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
