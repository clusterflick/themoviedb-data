His staging in Jesi's exquisite 18th-century Teatro Comunale Pergolesi includes the delightful comic intermezzo Livietta e Tracollo, thus following the precedent set at the premiere in 1734. A fine Italian cast and the distinguished Accademia Bizantina are led by the Accademia's director, Ottavio Dantone.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/71IBgwXq3a6Y4dgmQpENmYK2yy4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pergolesi: Adriano In Siria","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1874535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marina Comparato","original_name":"Marina Comparato","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5c409abec3a36859f54219b2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2219779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucia Cirillo","original_name":"Lucia Cirillo","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c409ac90e0a2655c4927c33","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2219780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annamaria DellOste","original_name":"Annamaria DellOste","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c409ad1c3a368216241d493","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1564070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Heaston","original_name":"Nicole Heaston","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5c409ad8925141344cb09eae","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2219781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefano Ferrari","original_name":"Stefano Ferrari","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5c409ae50e0a2646a291c4cb","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2219782,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ottavio Dantone","original_name":"Ottavio Dantone","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c409b0f0e0a2646a291c528","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/71IBgwXq3a6Y4dgmQpENmYK2yy4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
