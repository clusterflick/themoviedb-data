Most astronauts returned from space travel mad or with mystical delusions. As long as total secrecy was maintained, a select group of journalists spread across the planet were aware of these excursions, among them some journalists from the staff of O GLOBO. The astronauts reports are rare, but constant and delivered in two ways: audio reports and footage of the field trips, starring the brave Brazilian astronaut Erivaldo Mattüs. With the mysterious disappearance of our hero from Alagoas, the time has come for some of these reports to come to the attention of the public, through the infallible archives preserved by Gurcius Gewdner.","popularity":0.1502,"poster_path":"/Xa0O07hIHmgBkmB4OOwdpFkQnP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Erivaldo, o Astronauta Místico","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1866574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodrigo Fonseca","original_name":"Rodrigo Fonseca","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/4D54yKMf3RBTNVfU2b8ytRwWQm.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Reporter","credit_id":"60a00b5f807298005849d019","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3057576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcius Lindner","original_name":"Marcius Lindner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"60a00b6c0f36550078ea5d90","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3091499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erivaldo Mattus","original_name":"Erivaldo Mattus","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Astronaut","credit_id":"60a00b7b35a61e0058cdb063","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2042860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Priscilla Menezes","original_name":"Priscilla Menezes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Astronaut","credit_id":"60a00b892fccee00291732e6","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1262735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gurcius Gewdner","original_name":"Gurcius Gewdner","popularity":0.1221,"profile_path":"/aRe8AWNs3zupxKS2GgJskd6oRFc.jpg","credit_id":"60a00ad5b234b9005730b682","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1262735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gurcius Gewdner","original_name":"Gurcius Gewdner","popularity":0.1221,"profile_path":"/aRe8AWNs3zupxKS2GgJskd6oRFc.jpg","credit_id":"60a00af8e63571005975ccd1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1262735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gurcius Gewdner","original_name":"Gurcius Gewdner","popularity":0.1221,"profile_path":"/aRe8AWNs3zupxKS2GgJskd6oRFc.jpg","credit_id":"60a00b002fccee0040ca3c4a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1262735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gurcius Gewdner","original_name":"Gurcius Gewdner","popularity":0.1221,"profile_path":"/aRe8AWNs3zupxKS2GgJskd6oRFc.jpg","credit_id":"60a00b0ced2ac20079563e16","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1262735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gurcius Gewdner","original_name":"Gurcius Gewdner","popularity":0.1221,"profile_path":"/aRe8AWNs3zupxKS2GgJskd6oRFc.jpg","credit_id":"60a00b19d400f3002891f978","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3057581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mini Mulamba","original_name":"Mini Mulamba","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a00b4bb234b9003f7cdfc4","department":"Crew","job":"Editorial Staff"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1262735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gurcius Gewdner","original_name":"Gurcius Gewdner","popularity":0.1221,"profile_path":"/aRe8AWNs3zupxKS2GgJskd6oRFc.jpg","credit_id":"5c3de2a892514156e5ad4730","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4678146","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Xa0O07hIHmgBkmB4OOwdpFkQnP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":671}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
