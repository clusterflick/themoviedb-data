In Paris, she divides her time between an opera house, where she is the dresser for a great Swedish singer, and amateur theater. David, her director, pushes her to her limits: she cannot refuse, so stubbornly, to live and love again. Little by little, Sophie lets herself be disturbed by her speech, and moved by the amorous games and the sensual atmosphere of the opera on which she is working, \"Le Chevalier a la rose\" by Richard Strauss. After each performance, Sophie sees a silent young man, Valentin. She is convinced that he is coming for the beautiful singer. But one day, he speaks to her, and Sophie finally becomes an actress of her own story.","popularity":0.1761,"poster_path":"/2S2GeeTIMfZvVU4I0L3DbqwaoIB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11143,"logo_path":null,"name":"Madragoa Filmes","origin_country":"PT"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":6584,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gemini Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2007-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'étrangère","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":180970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Pratt","original_name":"Sarah Pratt","popularity":0.3465,"profile_path":"/pjBBtQ5G7UmveVOVBt58yoqPMj2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sophie","credit_id":"5db36be5f056d500140be4f6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clément Sibony","original_name":"Clément Sibony","popularity":0.1876,"profile_path":"/cabPDiJehGYlQF4WMoGSKIiUMon.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Valentin","credit_id":"63b441e35ad76b00e6fa5a76","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19075,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Morier-Genoud","original_name":"Philippe Morier-Genoud","popularity":0.1191,"profile_path":"/vMGXntjEzXx7n1gyWi11I2urB9k.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"David","credit_id":"63b441eca9117f055d570604","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1564068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte Hellekant","original_name":"Charlotte Hellekant","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mezzo-soprano - Octavian","credit_id":"63b441f37d5db50080e91891","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1049189,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mireille Delunsch","original_name":"Mireille Delunsch","popularity":0.0769,"profile_path":"/zaptS3DQhLQjzTC3CVOdvxCXTVm.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Soprano - Marschallin","credit_id":"63b441fe391b9c007efa3b34","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1382905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cassandre Berthon","original_name":"Cassandre Berthon","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Soprano - Sophie","credit_id":"63b4420a7d5db50080e918a2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1338325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolas Cavallier","original_name":"Nicolas Cavallier","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Singer","credit_id":"63b44216875d1a00e275cf77","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3856582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Hussain","original_name":"Leo Hussain","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"63b4421e1d1bf400d37aeca4","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2431752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Neves","original_name":"José Neves","popularity":0.0962,"profile_path":"/nMzUi8834f6F6EzgJ2YMoTJS157.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Key Grip","credit_id":"619ed70463536a0043a73ff9","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2217897,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Florence Colombani","original_name":"Florence Colombani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c3d8af20e0a2654c18eadf4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0496406","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1207,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/2S2GeeTIMfZvVU4I0L3DbqwaoIB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":804},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/oKqqcHoGC0qKfLw1rvz6kn90Yy6.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Locarno Film Festival","release_date":"2006-08-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
