I know it’s not only me, because there are others out there…”  ‘I Don’t Protest, I Just Dance In My Shadow’ is a short visual essay film by artist animator, Jessica Ashman, about navigating the visual art and animation world as a black face in a white space.  Using animation and recorded interviews of eight other women of colour artists, ‘I Don’t Protest, I Just Dance In My Shadow’ is an abstract confessional from the director herself: a visualisation of the joy, frustration, wishes and dreams of what it feels like to be a black women and a woman of colour artist, creating and existing.","popularity":0.235,"poster_path":"/uNQoAwrZWqbV1ZENt8I6gvoAxni.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arts Council of
