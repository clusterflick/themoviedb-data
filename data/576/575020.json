The stylistic premise was that the film would be a self-portrait, like a still photograph, that changed and grew through time. It is not a story, but it does revolve around a love affair gone wrong and a broken heart. Patton did not show this film for 40 years. He found it embarrassing. Now in his 60s, he is OK with it. All filmmakers have a first film.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/gW67WdZYtbOvLDSAdqRTnsPu7Ix.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1965-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time Portrait","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":18888,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rick Patton","original_name":"Rick Patton","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c3becedc3a36869493c614a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.718,"height":917,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gW67WdZYtbOvLDSAdqRTnsPu7Ix.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":658}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1965-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
