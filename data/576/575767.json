It's the early 1960's, and while Americans and Russians are racing to be the first in outer space, the people who live in a small town can't contain their fascination with the exploration of the cosmos. School children draw pictures of the moon, a repairman thinks he's found evidence of alien life forms, weekend painters develop a new perspective on the sky, kids get into the game by cobbling together a homemade spaceship, and a teacher obsessed with auto racing thinks he knows the secret behind some strange terrestrial events.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/51pbm7xmkobg4vh1JyCrg4s0Viw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Faint Trembling of the Landscape","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2219326,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philippe Fernandez","original_name":"Philippe Fernandez","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c4020189251417ba0abe56b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1370388","wikidata_id":"Q3270183","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":992,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/51pbm7xmkobg4vh1JyCrg4s0Viw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":699}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
