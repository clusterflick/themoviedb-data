Using real eyewitness accounts, directors Bénédicte Liénard and Mary Jiménez tell the story of a young woman who winds up in the clutches of forced prostitution when her initially hopeful attempt to escape the constrictions of her village goes wrong. Step by step, she is robbed of her moral and physical integrity. The film reconstitutes a space of dignity and returns voice and identity to a fate formally made nameless. With its powerful imagery, the girl’s traumatic odyssey embodies the destruction of life in a capitalist world in connection with horrific natural devastation.","popularity":0.2812,"poster_path":"/bUzUTTsDlN4mQoM2tNxmWvYdO8I.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32223,"logo_path":null,"name":"Clin d'oeil Films","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":74735,"logo_path":null,"name":"CBA","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":113598,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fonds Audiovisuel de Flandres (VAF)","origin_country":""},{"id":11796,"logo_path":"/tx6LOQcTSqgW8ffKxovuJHjlYVw.png","name":"Centre du Cinéma et de l'Audiovisuel de la FWB","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":113599,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinétroupe","origin_country":""},{"id":113600,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fonds Audiovisuel des Pays-Bas (NFF)","origin_country":""},{"id":100886,"logo_path":"/4WZMpUq2FoiRbcHGcfjN8ZklYZr.png","name":"Creative Europe Media","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":792,"logo_path":"/cRhBQP1FFNugNxKkO1pUgeD2Rkr.png","name":"RTBF","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":12025,"logo_path":"/sLVmKLJ2E0KSsfKiIYDjo4v6Y5l.png","name":"VRT","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":34574,"logo_path":"/sKFIZJUuctmEgDJngtIXMPjaRZ9.png","name":"BALDR","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":184355,"logo_path":"/zM5VRTYm17O5WhKH54UAmJNltpJ.png","name":"Dérives","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"}],"release_date":"2019-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"By the Name of Tania","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Con el nombre de Tania","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2219434,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tanit Lidia Coquiche Cenepo","original_name":"Tanit Lidia Coquiche Cenepo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Tania","credit_id":"5c40494d9251416b02b076e8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2219435,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ismael Vasquez Colchado","original_name":"Ismael Vasquez Colchado","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Policeman","credit_id":"5c40495d0e0a26765391e061","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2219436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yossimar Vietto Omnia","original_name":"Yossimar Vietto Omnia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Rubén","credit_id":"5c40496a9251417a60ae9c2a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2219438,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fiorella J.
