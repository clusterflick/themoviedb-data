A country that not long ago suffered daily power outages is engaged in a highly technological form of capitalism. What's more, much of this activity is concentrated in the rural, wine-growing region of Kakheti. In the countryside, cows graze amidst internet towers and are killed by machines; drones fly over vineyards; horse-drawn carriages travel on unpaved roads where electricity poles are being repaired and labour is performed by computers. The boundary between the natural and virtual is slowly being eradicated.","popularity":0.0786,"poster_path":"/9ydH1neMLpvJrnWUsVRl5DHs5Ia.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"}],"release_date":"2019-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Harvest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","title":"Mosavali","type":"Latinized Georgian title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2219498,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Misho Antadze","original_name":"Misho Antadze","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/mAtptx5ic9OO0Vcrh6j9nmtO7qZ.jpg","credit_id":"5c4050bcc3a36859f541b981","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10341224","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aB5m8FKrWSGfoSIHPQMbK9w617Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.684,"height":2413,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9ydH1neMLpvJrnWUsVRl5DHs5Ia.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1650},{"aspect_ratio":0.736,"height":2413,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fbPrdiQ4uphjrYLQzanxlDNYlgY.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1775},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gHkFhKf28oGAAsSvv3dHi44EKoE.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":0.636,"height":786,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a00b4LrgNFs8Ev3mR51zlpuqkY4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jeonju International Film Festival","release_date":"2019-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
