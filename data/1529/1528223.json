Michael walks you step-by-step through the Floating Bill as he performed it on The Tonight Show. You'll learn how to prepare the gimmick, how to load the bill onto and off the gimmick without breaking it, how to escalate the effect in the mind of the spectator, how to end with the spectator unwrapping the bill, and how to remain constantly hooked up using the invisible Elastic Gimmick. Also featuring John Cornelius' The Coin That Falls Up, The Coin Through Glass Top Table, the Coin Through Swinging Glass Door, and John's beautiful Visual Retention Coin Pass.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/960eC797lWhp4KzMEMo3dtyCDn3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Michael Ammar's Classic Renditions","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5618151,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Ammar","original_name":"Michael Ammar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6898ee2e4c28e2310c5e35f4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2003462,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian O'Kelley","original_name":"Brian O'Kelley","popularity":0.1415,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6898ef2eb1a4590dbe5e3503","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2003462,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian O'Kelley","original_name":"Brian O'Kelley","popularity":0.1415,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6898ef4105dd2479715e351b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5618151,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Ammar","original_name":"Michael Ammar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6898ef55993a5e9777267b06","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/960eC797lWhp4KzMEMo3dtyCDn3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
