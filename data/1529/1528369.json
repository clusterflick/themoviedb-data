My Palestine is the story of how they were living, what it was like to go to school there, what they played in the 'hara' or playgrounds. The story is told by the people who were born and grew up there before 1948. They then talk us through the war that forced them to leave their homes and lives forever. It commemorates the 70th anniversary of the Nakba and its impact on those who lived through it.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Palestine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5618564,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lubna Dajani","original_name":"Lubna Dajani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68993265914c8546a18dabe1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
