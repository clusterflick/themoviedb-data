At a stone bench, two brothers, JAVA and JINO, are seen chatting, the elder being a friend of the director. The footage, originally shot on the director’s mobile phone, was later transformed to evoke the style of a silent film: the visuals were toned to resemble aged black-and-white film and accompanied by music from City Lights (1931) by Charlie Chaplin, enhancing the atmosphere reminiscent of the silent cinema’s final years in the early 1930s.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/sXXm0my6dhsbllHZkNggHBcOwlv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":249201,"logo_path":null,"name":"Independent.
