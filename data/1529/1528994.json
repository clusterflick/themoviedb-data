What Dolly does not know about housekeeping would fill several volumes, but she is a sweet young thing, and they have a good cook. The cook takes a holiday and Dolly, after reading one of the dainty menus in the columns of a lady's magazine, decides to prepare luncheon \"all by herself.\" She starts in bravely to make flannel cakes out of flannel, and other dishes according to her own limited ideas of cookery, then sends a note to her husband telling him to be sure to come to lunch. Ernest rashly invites his employer to take lunch with him, but when Dolly's fearful and wonderful dishes are set before him the situation becomes serious. Fortunately the chief article of the list turns out to be a laughable surprise and the ludicrous aspect of the affair averts disaster for Ernest.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1914-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Magazine Cooking","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2241765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Burt Bucher","original_name":"Burt Bucher","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"689b36df3d8d61e18d268738","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5621240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sadie Midgely","original_name":"Sadie Midgely","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"689b36e74c95e2be9d8dba84","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Hardy","original_name":"Oliver Hardy","popularity":0.512,"profile_path":"/qRMGQo5oWwcLpwgXSoArXK5riwe.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"689b36eeba6b1a31045e3e9f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3474972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John A.
