A symbolic collapse of the American consumer dream. It’s less a filmic conclusion than a meditative act of annihilation, signaling a longing to dismantle civilization’s banal comforts. In today’s world, the slow-motion destruction might be reimagined as the intimate shattering of the invisible structures we live in: your social media profiles, your streaming queue, your cloud archives, your email inbox, your mobile devices — all blown into glittering, floating fragments against the black sky.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zabriskie Point Re-imagined","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":232613,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Damon Packard","original_name":"Damon Packard","popularity":1.2606,"profile_path":"/oOFRTIqiNxIWaWkNUqW2h5srNrs.jpg","credit_id":"689a688bd7e1256b40c6fb84","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
