From penning the global sensation “Bird Box” (later adapted into the smash-hit Netflix movie starring Sandra Bullock) to writing the theme song for the Emmy-winning series “Shameless” and touring the world with his band, his life is as unpredictable and thrilling as one of his novels. But behind every writer’s success is the haunting presence of the blank page.  TO ALL THE BOOKS invites you to ride shotgun with Malerman as he wrestles with the creative process of his next novel, offering a rare, behind-the-scenes look at the highs, lows, and beautiful chaos of artistic life. Brimming with raw honesty and unfiltered passion, this fly-on-the-wall documentary is a must-see for readers, writers, and dreamers alike.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/jY29i4EQp7OIHxENnAFrG1DA2AA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To All the Books","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37538177","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jY29i4EQp7OIHxENnAFrG1DA2AA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
