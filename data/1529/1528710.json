Consisting of meter-long brown algae, it stores as much CO2 as the Amazon rainforest. It is also home to numerous animal and plant species and a paradise of biodiversity: from crabs and starfish to small sharks and octopuses, many creatures use the kelp forest as a refuge. Kelp is also a healthy source of food, which is why the brown algae is currently experiencing a hype in South Africa.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/jHlnkoeMiW2zpkgjGojn6UZHp4W.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Der Kelpwald - Südafrikas geheimnisvolle Unterwasserwelt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Afrique du Sud - La forêt sous-marine de kelp","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3482544,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lynn Klockow","original_name":"Lynn Klockow","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689a52cda3074a82a78f5aab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5620170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katharina Pechel","original_name":"Katharina Pechel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689a52dfba6b1a31045e3b7f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33808539","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/utMx2M63lwlfLx9k3S9JXKT1f9r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/orRDCQcWuzOHMTuFpC2tHSPP2a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":794,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/jHlnkoeMiW2zpkgjGojn6UZHp4W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"ARTE","release_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
