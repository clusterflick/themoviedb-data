A single film never begins; instead, opening scenes pretending to be from different films repeat schizophrenically. This anxiety, named the invasion sense, constructs a complete reality through unexecuted directives — unrealized wars, uncured illnesses. The film paradoxically addresses a present in which, even without a main plot, anxiety itself constitutes a world, suspended between fiction and reality.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"That Anxiety Has a Mise-en-Scène","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5332964,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cho Hee-soo","original_name":"Cho Hee-soo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689a1850ba92f57338b6ff38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cinematheque KOFA","release_date":"2025-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
