Bilbo must face the hardest decision ever, whether to betray his friends for the good of Middle Earth, or to let havoc run loose upon the newly reclaimed Dwarven Kingdom, as Thorin's love of The Jewel begins to poison his own mind. Although they can't waste too much time, as now the dragon is gone, a battle for the new Kingdom is on the horizon as armies come from all sides, in the hope to make claim for the crown and what is rightfully owed. As Middle Earth prepares for battle, and with The One Ring also at play, who will live, who will die, and what will happen to Bilbo and the ring?
