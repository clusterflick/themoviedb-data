A remnant of an ancient rite, I set out to see what remained of it in Galatina on June 28th, a feast day. Reusing the trance images from Mingozzi's film Taranta (1962), I contrast them with the beauty of Puglia and what happens today on June 28th, when the tarantella is danced until the early hours.  \"Des Tarantelles\" is a poetic reflection on transformation, the survival of rites in our contemporary world.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/91YoTto2yrXOf8JQOhFh23RLGrO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Des Tarentelles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4777713,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katharina Bellan","original_name":"Katharina Bellan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689a5f97c257d220dab7041d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/91YoTto2yrXOf8JQOhFh23RLGrO.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
