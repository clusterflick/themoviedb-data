It stars Adam Scott, Zach Cherry, Britt Lower, Tramell Tillman, Jen Tullock, Dichen Lachman, Michael Chernus, John Turturro, Christopher Walken, and Patricia Arquette, with Sarah Bock joining the main cast in the second season. The series follows employees at the biotechnology corporation Lumon Industries that have undergone \"severance\"â€”a medical procedure that ensures they retain no memories of the outside world while at work and have no recollection of their job once they leave. This results in two distinct personalities for each employee: the \"innie\", who exists solely within Lumon, and the \"outie\", who lives their personal life outside of work.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/iw550jnSWejAfdtCWFke8oOovxv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":990,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Severance  2022 Carl","title":"Severance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w8FkvbyoeXmAZDFrqFYT57F8lil.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iw550jnSWejAfdtCWFke8oOovxv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
