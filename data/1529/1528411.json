The reference to Goya is assumed, but only halfway or in half-tone: we don't see the monsters. The emphasis is on what precedes it: sleep, not the absolute nightmare it produces. The film is very simply a series of tableaux and little tales in the style of Kafka: ordinary stories in the ordinary world of colonization and madness. Beyond a short introduction, I've tried to say nothing. The three-line texts that come before each painting are like chapter headings in the novels of yesteryear: where we shall see - where we shall see that... We only see it in the body of each chapter, i.e. in the pictures.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sleep of Reason","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
