This is another type of gallery, with a less intimidating front and above all where the prices are affordable. Indeed, in these \"accessible\" places, you can buy a figurative painting for a moderate price, (between one thousand and ten thousand francs maximum) without knowing anything about either painting or the art market but simply because you fall in love with it. This trade has given birth to a prosperous market which produces and distributes mainly landscapes, landscapes of Provence or Brittany.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/5ABBNUzHSnnzdsoQPBuHq2ShKY1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":207,"logo_path":"/uskenzq65wJe0cT0D8StQI3hJnO.png","name":"Agat Films & Cie / Ex Nihilo","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":8649,"logo_path":"/130H7TsGokNIPyGHYZc9ftU3jJ7.png","name":"Mikros Image","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peinture fraîche","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5618526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joël Guilloteau","original_name":"Joël Guilloteau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"art agent","credit_id":"68992ae105dd2479715e3608","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5618528,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Maurice Suvé","original_name":"Maurice Suvé","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"editor","credit_id":"68992afee73fea5cef5d1382","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5618529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcel Spilliaert","original_name":"Marcel Spilliaert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"expert in modern paintings","credit_id":"68992b15ce44cdd34fb6fcc1","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2221819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pascale Thirode","original_name":"Pascale Thirode","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/tX0dQZhyLesrJCg9YtpR6bp0vxr.jpg","credit_id":"689925b853a197e6e2e24bec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2221819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pascale Thirode","original_name":"Pascale Thirode","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/tX0dQZhyLesrJCg9YtpR6bp0vxr.jpg","credit_id":"689925c053a197e6e2e24bef","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2221819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pascale Thirode","original_name":"Pascale Thirode","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/tX0dQZhyLesrJCg9YtpR6bp0vxr.jpg","credit_id":"689925cd9bc7557415e24bb3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":24845,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Catherine Zins","original_name":"Catherine Zins","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68992b23ede701dd33b6ff2d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1162533,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sarah Turoche","original_name":"Sarah Turoche","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68992b31827424b39be24c6f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3210983,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Pascale Alibert","original_name":"Pascale Alibert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68992b614848151129b6ffd1","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4093697,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Frédéric Scherer","original_name":"Frédéric Scherer","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68992b785778695f9fe24dcf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2433638,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bruno Franc","original_name":"Bruno Franc","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68992b9453a197e6e2e24c1d","department":"Crew","job":"Mix Technician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5618532,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Matias Canavese","original_name":"Matias Canavese","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68992bb5a8cae6d7a58eae7b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5618533,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Antonin Rohée","original_name":"Antonin Rohée","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68992bccc257d220dab6ff24","department":"Crew","job":"Generator Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/5ABBNUzHSnnzdsoQPBuHq2ShKY1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
