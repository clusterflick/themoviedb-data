To do so, he suggested filming one of his seminars. This was no easy task: Benny Lévy was wary of images, preferring words and the patient study of texts, and feared that the intrusion of cameras would profoundly alter the teaching relationship – a discreet, dense and intimate relationship.  Berroyer eventually overcame his resistance and asked Pascale Thirode to produce the film. The result is Benny Lévy, traces of a teaching, which presents selected moments from the 1996 course on Plato's Alcibiades, considered an introductory dialogue to his thinking.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/vOTLYcjKFmtOQ8yRKODzLXBc1Qy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":270762,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pascale Thirode","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Benny Lévy, traces d'un enseignement","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2221819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pascale Thirode","original_name":"Pascale Thirode","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/tX0dQZhyLesrJCg9YtpR6bp0vxr.jpg","credit_id":"68992d682ac418bf515e3675","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2221819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pascale Thirode","original_name":"Pascale Thirode","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/tX0dQZhyLesrJCg9YtpR6bp0vxr.jpg","credit_id":"68992d72a4875980485d1232","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5618537,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gilles Hanus","original_name":"Gilles Hanus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68992d7f3d8d61e18d267f05","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackie Berroyer","original_name":"Jackie Berroyer","popularity":3.6037,"profile_path":"/zd5uWXdJAzVNo94ftRXEMc160ry.jpg","credit_id":"68992d86fea27b5940e24dab","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2221819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pascale Thirode","original_name":"Pascale Thirode","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/tX0dQZhyLesrJCg9YtpR6bp0vxr.jpg","credit_id":"68992d915c62703bbce24b33","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1156329,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Brach","original_name":"Eric Brach","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68992d99c257d220dab6ff30","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5618538,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Serge Ankri","original_name":"Serge Ankri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68992da32ac418bf515e367f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2015363,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pascal Després","original_name":"Pascal Després","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68992dbae22b1316c55e3682","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":935589,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier Taieb","original_name":"Olivier Taieb","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68992dc17f24db9c02b6ffed","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5618539,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bertrand Fecci","original_name":"Bertrand Fecci","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68992dc88cccdcfb755e3558","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/vOTLYcjKFmtOQ8yRKODzLXBc1Qy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
