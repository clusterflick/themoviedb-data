Ahead of her time in so many ways, Boty’s story ends with her tragic early death at 28 in 1966 and the subsequent revival of interest in her work in the last decade.  Packed full of original photographs and art work, the film calls on an array of family, friends, art critics and famous fans to lead us through the Boty story. Contributors include pop art titan Sir Peter Blake, comedian and artist Jim Moir, critic Kate Bryan, best friend and print designer Natalie Gibson MBE, pop singers Corrine Drewery and Tanita Tikaram and TV presenter Ronnie Archer Morgan.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":133351,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mono Media Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":8144,"logo_path":null,"name":"Channel X","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pauline Boty: I Am the Sixties","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Boty: I Am the Sixties","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1712920,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Cogswell","original_name":"Lee Cogswell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689aa0ce5f6878f4815e3e33","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5620607,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vinny Rawding","original_name":"Vinny Rawding","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689aa0f6b787a192fb2682bb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
