It moves slowly, letting you see life after a personal tragedy through the eyes of Agnes, a young woman who feels the world moving on without her. The story is gentle but powerful, showing that healing is rarely quick and almost never simple.  Eva Victor, who both directs and plays Agnes, brings a natural honesty to the role. She shows pain without overacting and hope without forcing it. The supporting cast, including Naomi Ackie and Lucas Hedges, make the film feel even more real. Their characters are not perfect—they don’t always know the right thing to say—but that makes them relatable.  The movie focuses on small, human moments: a glance, a pause in conversation, the way someone looks away when they don’t know how to respond.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A quiet journey through loss, love, and the small moments that lead to healing.","title":"Sorry, Baby – A Gentle Story of Healing and Hope","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
