How does human imagination develop? Razi loves stories. His favorite is \"The Monster.\" He keeps asking his father to tell him that story over and over again. Every time his father tells it, Razi lets himself be swept away by his two-year-old imagination, experiencing the developments and details as if he had never heard it before. The story so dearly loved by Razi is ancient, but it must be listened to again and again, especially for a Palestinian child.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"And an Image Was Born","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2373047,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Firas Khoury","original_name":"Firas Khoury","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"689a3bb84f4665d261b7033d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
