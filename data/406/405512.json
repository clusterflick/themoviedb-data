Using a unique collection of his own home movies shot between 1948 and 1977 and discovered years after his death, this film presents an intriguing and intimate portrait of Peter Sellers.  A DVD was issued entitled \"Peter Sellers - As He Filmed It\" which is a 97 minute edit of this original broadcast. Not long after the 3 part documentary series was broadcast it was pulled due to \"licencing\" issues over home-movie footage used that the Sellers estate had not agreed to. The BBC lost the case I believe and thus the reason for the 97mins DVD that was then later released excising the vast majority of the rare illuminating footage.","popularity":0.0884,"poster_path":"/3H6PwD72NUY2g0YjgYRS3AKGXVn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17179,"logo_path":null,"name":"BBC Arena","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1995-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":205,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Peter Sellers Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12446,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Sellers","original_name":"Peter Sellers","popularity":0.8718,"profile_path":"/sCVIv2DGoC9U16anTjLwMxKBPZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6293b85f3ff2df18c7e30bf6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":152134,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Lydon","original_name":"Peter Lydon","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5780d7129251417a1a001ec8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0841931","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3H6PwD72NUY2g0YjgYRS3AKGXVn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1995-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
