The British celebrate their victory by hanging his head out on a conquered fortress. To end such humiliation, the commander's daughter seeks help from the leader of the local rebels, Benjamin. Their attempts to steal the head enrage the British. The British conceal the head in one of a dozen identical boxes, and gather intelligence on Benjamin's moves from a spy who disguises as a priest. Knowing little about the modern warfare, the rebels are frustrated by their well armed counterpart in several bloody confrontations. Benjamin resorts to ambush the British commanders in a forest and the explosive final attack is launched.","popularity":0.4279,"poster_path":"/pkifviDQIryEawYSQSgJL8f8OA1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48805,"logo_path":null,"name":"Changchun Film Studio","origin_country":"CN"},{"id":181840,"logo_path":"/yF76RLTDFnM0GBEjpqrvYtCdoyG.png","name":"长春电影制片厂","origin_country":"CN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"1992-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"义剑奇侠","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"In Sword We Trust","type":"DVD Title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Righteous Swords And Extraordinary Heroes","type":"Literal Title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Righteous Sword Of The Extraordinary Hero","type":"Literal Title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Swordsman And The General","type":"Alternative English Title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Rigghteous Sword, Rare Chivalous","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1914918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xiaojian Xu","original_name":"Xiaojian Xu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"62dad37b50733c0068f6961d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3427410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Li Yunjuan","original_name":"Li Yunjuan","popularity":0.2845,"profile_path":"/vcqo20OnFCVT8TGC1uplMgijmaJ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62dad38215dea00056506bfb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1904952,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Li Xida","original_name":"Li Xida","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/lVMRzhg3Dhnhd5hbNCR8rAw2TVP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62dad38850733c005040e39e","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2595649,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xiangyuan Yu","original_name":"Xiangyuan Yu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62dad39861bac4004cb56bd7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5862362","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pkifviDQIryEawYSQSgJL8f8OA1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/ghucj6oeN7Pzw2PaoR5gBGW85yM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":210608,"name":"1990s"},{"id":236217,"name":"qing dynasty"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"1992-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
