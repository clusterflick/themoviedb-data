First, one of the three is shot during the robbery, leaving the young couple, Simon (Steve Kelly) and Lisa, (Marcia Carol Miller Dollarhide) to fend for themselves. The two decide to separate and rendezvous in a deserted house. Simon arrives first, and proceeds to spend the night there, waiting for Lisa. During the night, Simon comes face to face with the dark presences of an axe murderer (Dan Skinner) and his victims, who attempt to claim him as one of their own.","popularity":0.1319,"poster_path":"/8rhhgkEUK1l3xqZnsFk3sXdQmiU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79230,"logo_path":null,"name":"Borderline Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-04-25","revenue":10000,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"From the director of RAVAGE","title":"Sinistre","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Sinyster","type":"VHS release"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1649139,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Steve Kelly","original_name":"Steve Kelly","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Simon","credit_id":"5784db36c3a3684ef70036dc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1649140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Skinner","original_name":"Dan Skinner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Aaron","credit_id":"5784db46c3a3685ae0002d8c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1649141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
