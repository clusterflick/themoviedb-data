In the late 1970s the British artist developed a pioneering concept which also changed his perspective on painting – his “joiners”. In this film, the artist himself talks about this photographic approach, a kind of Cubism-inspired photocollage which explores the space-time continuum. Hockney allows the viewer to share in the creative “joiner” process and leads us step by step into the universe of his artistic creativity.","popularity":0.2671,"poster_path":"/tLquqNI0QU7k1AQgKFvkXdDqy8S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"An exploration of Hockney's technique for creating photo montages or 'joiners'.","title":"David Hockney: Joiner Photographs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1102300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Hockney","original_name":"David Hockney","popularity":0.1373,"profile_path":"/mUPzSASAKnpR9FjkUXz7LcOfKv5.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63b53a7c1d1bf4007dbe4aaf","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47870,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nick Evans","original_name":"Nick Evans","popularity":0.0994,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"577d2182c3a36817ea0003ac","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1519118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Don Featherstone","original_name":"Don Featherstone","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"577d21249251415d9800034f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melvyn Bragg","original_name":"Melvyn Bragg","popularity":0.3052,"profile_path":"/fT3m5FRLXX5U2Y2olSeTKO0m9wR.jpg","credit_id":"577d2144c3a36817f1000399","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt25479012","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tLquqNI0QU7k1AQgKFvkXdDqy8S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6025,"name":"photography"},{"id":5918,"name":"painting"},{"id":2679,"name":"artist"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1983-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
