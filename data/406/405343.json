Solovky was established in a complex of ancient monasteries on a cluster of islands off the remote White Sea coast. Though its name derives from the Russian word for nightingale, the title of the film echoes the term 'Soviet power', stressing the fact that from the very beginning the Soviet penal colonies were a world unto themselves.","popularity":0.0998,"poster_path":"/fjIGPzl5JmFuwaD4Da90APH9JOF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":344,"logo_path":"/xenuUvcunUNpbaDOYGhWZERaym7.png","name":"Mosfilm","origin_country":"SU"},{"id":20017,"logo_path":null,"name":"Krug","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1988-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Solovky Power","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Власть Соловецкая","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Vlast Solovetskaya.
