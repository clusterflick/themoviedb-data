The video starts in his studio, where his computer, desk and chair are “haunted” - dissolving and reforming in a myriad of mirrored shapes, going from recognizable to abstract to obliterated. The scans blend with Murata’s own computer rendered fragments, further emphasizing the high and low, real and unreal. The result can be seen as an homage to both Walt Disney’s The Sorcerer’s Apprentice and Bruce Nauman’s Mapping the Studio.","popularity":0.0789,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night Moves","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1578457,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takeshi Murata","original_name":"Takeshi Murata","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/3E74jop2Scuc9UhnkqOp3pt9Eqg.jpg","credit_id":"577fb6aa92514173ce0042f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1647116,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Billy Grant","original_name":"Billy Grant","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"577fb6bf9251410cd2003fc2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
