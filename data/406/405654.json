Richard was born with a complex disability. He needs 24-hour care, seven days a week. Now in her early sixties, his mother Deirdre is apprehensive about her son's future. She is determined to build a circle of friends and carers for Richard, and to find him sustainable long-term accommodation. Wiseman's intimate documentary, enriched by Deirdre's impassioned voice, reveals just what it means to care for someone who needs care for life.","popularity":0.0805,"poster_path":"/vHYtON36hS98HRq9Yww1ZbsK285.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Thirty years.
