FALN chronicles key events of the era, from the 1958 overthrow of dictator Perez Jimenez, and the flawed attempts at social reform by Romulo Betancourt's government, to the 1962 emergence of the national liberation movement- the FALN. The FALN engaged in rural and urban guerrilla struggle throughout the Sixties, but, failing to achieve its desired coup d'etat or to gain the support of the nation's poor, the organization had largely dissipated by the end of the decade. A compilation documentary incorporating both archival footage and original scenes shot by members of the revolutionary movement, FALN draws parallels with American foreign policy in other countries, particularly Vietnam.","popularity":0.1229,"poster_path":"/a6QgtD9mtWaTJXV519hxCVjXGPL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"1965-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FALN","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Kramer","original_name":"Robert Kramer","popularity":0.0906,"profile_path":"/tSbaZNs37qLaVic7m4IDZZBz558.jpg","credit_id":"577d3267c3a36817ea000abd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1043432,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Gessner","original_name":"Peter Gessner","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"577d327c9251415d91000a76","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0369411","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a6QgtD9mtWaTJXV519hxCVjXGPL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"116 University Place","release_date":"1965-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
