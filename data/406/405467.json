She openly reveals her life story through a canine prism â€“ lovers may come and go, but there are always the dogs. Leahy also weaves in her filmmaking career, starting out at the Women's Film Workshop in 1970s Sydney and the newly formed AFTRS. Dogs have carried her through childhood illness and heartbreak; in return she lavishes care, and frets over their waywardness. Today, she shares her life with a big brown Labrador called Baxter. There are echoes of Leahy's award-winning My Life Without Steve, a study in love and loss, in this meditative and romantic film.","popularity":0.1991,"poster_path":"/c7HfqgM0A4Ql6GknBRw4dets2S2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104343,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gecko Films Pty.
