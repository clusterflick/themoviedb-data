I make no claims for it, nor do I offer any apologies. It comes from work on The Thoughts That Once We Had. There was one shot we had to cut whose loss I particularly regretted. It was a shot of a train pulling into Tokyo Station from Ozu’s The Only Son (1936). So I decided to make a film around this shot, an anthology of train arrivals. It comprises 26 scenes or shots from movies, 1904-2015. It has a simple serial structure: each black &amp; white sequence in the first half rhymes with a color sequence in the second half. Thus the first shot and the final shot show trains arriving at stations in Japan from a low camera height. In the first shot (The Only Son), the train moves toward the right; in the last shot, it moves toward the left. A bullet train has replaced a steam locomotive. So after all these years, I’ve made another structural film, although that was not my original intention.”","popularity":0.3599,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Train Arrives at the Station","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1410576,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Kim","original_name":"Andrew Kim","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/4aEmCmZ82icAMEV2xxDIeex0iWw.jpg","credit_id":"57805038c3a368355b001a3f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120969,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thom Andersen","original_name":"Thom Andersen","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":"/AgqAplydKlWWIpQgJd8lZSvV2u3.jpg","credit_id":"57804d039251414534001966","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120969,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thom Andersen","original_name":"Thom Andersen","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":"/AgqAplydKlWWIpQgJd8lZSvV2u3.jpg","credit_id":"57804d389251415db20034db","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120969,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thom Andersen","original_name":"Thom Andersen","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":"/AgqAplydKlWWIpQgJd8lZSvV2u3.jpg","credit_id":"57804d45c3a36835e0001b97","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2823743,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Christine Chang","original_name":"Christine Chang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8fe928f90b19003503bc5a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6532186","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":13008,"name":"train"},{"id":227202,"name":"structural film"},{"id":227203,"name":"ozu"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
