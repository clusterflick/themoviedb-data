Progressing like a detective story, The Sacred Triangle investigates the influence Lou Reed and Iggy Pop had to David Bowieâ€™s (then on the verge of a breakthrough) music and stage persona. The section on the Velvet Underground alone is enough of a reason to watch this movie.","popularity":0.6472,"poster_path":"/kLcE6wCqV8TYWUnPPcK0sakGUWW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48373,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sexy Intellectual","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bowie, Iggy & Lou 1971-1973: The Sacred Triangle","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Bowie","original_name":"David Bowie","popularity":0.9542,"profile_path":"/qrqQJivS0zLzxZKfgNZnDtjbqpI.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"577f1313c3a36879b3000224","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iggy Pop","original_name":"Iggy Pop","popularity":1.0052,"profile_path":"/kZwFoGujhS3D39R1uyuyNbgSPr0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"577f131992514173d10001c5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lou Reed","original_name":"Lou Reed","popularity":0.492,"profile_path":"/lWFiXdQtYHqr2EXnk5nhDFm36XF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"577f13229251413ac10015ea","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1646964,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alec Lindsell","original_name":"Alec Lindsell","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"577f137d9251413b2d001783","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6494534","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dxl4TVroVYlF2ikegVB2OVbZj5n.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/igjnxeqYsMOcuMRJsQl60VSTjOY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":704},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2762,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kLcE6wCqV8TYWUnPPcK0sakGUWW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1841}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
