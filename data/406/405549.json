At Leipzig’s International Mahler Festival, to mark the centenary of Mahler’s death, they performed his monumental Second Symphony in the Gewandhaus – together with two marvellous soloists and choral forces quite beyond compare. About the final movement the composer said: “The increasing tension, working up to the final climax, is so tremendous that I don’t know myself, now that it is over, how I ever came to write it.” The painting “Morgenrot” was chosen by internationally acclaimed artist Neo Rauch to feature on the cover of this release on DVD and Blu-ray.","popularity":0.0389,"poster_path":"/1r8JxHgGYLlPJQ4UgGODO9R8SDg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71247,"logo_path":null,"name":"Accentus Music","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2011-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gustav Mahler - Symphony No.  2 (Riccardo Chailly, Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra)","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":130181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Connolly","original_name":"Sarah Connolly","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/sZR6Pua1rScNitMsPOmINZ4If4F.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Soloist","credit_id":"57810aad92514173fe000955","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1647566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christiane Oelze","original_name":"Christiane Oelze","popularity":0.0511,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Soloist","credit_id":"57810ac4c3a36843bf00096d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1383786,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Riccardo Chailly","original_name":"Riccardo Chailly","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/lIA0VTcCG1wgGAKwVbPi3t9TYOc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"57810ae9c3a36859740003ca","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2922357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gewandhausorchester Leipzig","original_name":"Gewandhausorchester Leipzig","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff5687bd38b580042cb4817","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1651,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1r8JxHgGYLlPJQ4UgGODO9R8SDg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1101}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
