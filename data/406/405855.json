It has excellent writing, direction and a professional quality about it you might not normally expect--plus the film is cute as can be with a really clever story. However, given that I have seen another of Adam Bertocci's excellent short films, LOVE: THE MOVIE, I actually was expecting something special--as LOVE was a heck of a fresh and entertaining film as well. Both films, it turns out, have already received awards and I certainly am not surprised. In fact, I can't wait until Bertocci \"turns pro\" so to speak--in other words, moves to Hollywood and makes a bazillion bucks making more nice little films--but with bigger budgets. Keep an eye out for this guy.","popularity":0.177,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":79132,"logo_path":null,"name":"School of Communication","origin_country":""},{"id":79127,"logo_path":null,"name":"Northwestern University","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Friend Like This Only Comes Along Once In Nine Lifetimes.","title":"Pat Gets a Cat","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":899400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morgan Beck","original_name":"Morgan Beck","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Patrick Levin","credit_id":"5783127f9251417136004475","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1648463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Mark","original_name":"Emily Mark","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Katrina Fells","credit_id":"578312ac9251417397001c39","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1648465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ganon","original_name":"Ganon","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Princess","credit_id":"578312d692514173a4001ec5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1648467,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Ingenthron","original_name":"Anna Ingenthron","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Robin Aderyn","credit_id":"578312f9c3a368611f004ba8","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1600941,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Bertocci","original_name":"Adam Bertocci","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5783125492514173a4001e39","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0805582","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":977,"name":"cat"},{"id":18165,"name":"animals"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
