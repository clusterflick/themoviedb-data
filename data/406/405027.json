It stands nearly eight feet tall, walks like a man, and weighs over six hundred pounds. The American Indians feared and respected it. They called it Sasquatch. Frank VanderSchmidt and Ron warren both know this beast. They've been tracking it for years. Ron wants to photograph it to prove to science that it exists so that it can be protected and studied. Frank wants to kill it. To him, Squownch, is simply the ultimate trophy. Both \"men\" are driven by a maniacal determination that borders on obsession, and in the huntfor the elusive Sasquatch, they risk losing everything - even their minds. This film follows Frank and Ron through the forests of ORegon and Washington during the summer of 2006. It's an adventure you'll never forget.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/hx3eOXisClgNyveHuWpRkOJCFy6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-06-06","revenue":5000,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The only good sasquatch is a dead sasquatch","title":"Scream of the Sasquatch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1646013,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guy Gilray","original_name":"Guy Gilray","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"577c85fa925141110e003968","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0940930","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hx3eOXisClgNyveHuWpRkOJCFy6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":668}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
