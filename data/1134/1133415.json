Raised in a Christian home, yet Jake has never been much of a believer. Jake has no major goals other than marrying his fiancee. That is... ...until a series of occurrences start happening that shake the very core of his being. Jake's Mother is a devoted Christian who has never given up on her son's lack of faith. Her prayers are finally answered as God starts to reach out to Jake in different ways, including Jake's medium. Jake tries to ignore the messages, but God reaches deeper until he sees a rebirth in Jake. When The Message is completely delivered, Jake will see that for God there are no limits.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Message","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1842508","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
