His car won't start and it's absolutely essential that he get across Los Angeles for a birthday party. But it's not just any birthday party. This is a party for Alli, the girl he's had a crush on for months now. After a series of failed attempts to get a ride, he's forced to ask his crazy neighbor for her car and despite the awkwardness, she is willing to help by offering him the only thing her ex-boyfriend didn't take - an embarrassingly pink beach cruiser with a basket on the front. With that Don sets off on his journey across a city where everyone drives. With the summer heat beating down on him, Don and his bike encounter apathetic friends, annoying co-workers, store clerks with too much advice, thieves, stoners and a cop with a major hero complex. Even though he's on the brink of defeat his determination kicks into over drive. He MUST get to Alli. After all, Don is a man on a mission.","popularity":0.0593,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bicycle Lane","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2430340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Ian Black","original_name":"Donald Ian Black","popularity":0.1932,"profile_path":"/arhU242oo1gs2oVVhberf5RpQ9L.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67e430557db9e70c47dcb302","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2064817,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jeffrey W.
