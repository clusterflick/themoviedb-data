Many actors in the cast play two roles wile some parts are played by two actors. The classic problem play is framed by a fictional film musical about a 1950s housewife and mockumentary footage set during its production and leading up to its tenth anniversary - while the dialogue and story are peppered with lines from other Shakespeare works. Made with mostly consumer-grade equipment over more than 20 years, it also illustrates the evolution of the way most of us see things - while providing glimpses behind the scenes, both real and staged.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Live Ashes","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11257554","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
