Terrorist attack in Bratislava. Death of two innocent LGBTI+ people - Juraj and Matúš. No political response. This monochromatic documentary requiem explores the unimproved state of Slovak society after the attack, as well as the wide range of feelings of LGBTI+ people, including the author himself. The repressed emotions fail to filter through even on a self-defence course. The well remains poisoned, the poison called disrespect still unable to be eradicated from it. Is it really necessary for people to live in fear?","popularity":0.0473,"poster_path":"/dkGvb13OnXTW1lTGJD2dXuag168.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90845,"logo_path":null,"name":"FTF VŠMU","origin_country":"SK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poisoned Well","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","title":"Otrávená studňa","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4619497,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kristián Katona","original_name":"Kristián Katona","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66051aa1813cb6016218de9f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4619492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Petr Chromčák","original_name":"Petr Chromčák","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66051a6fd400f3017d901e72","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3707718,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michal Vasiľ","original_name":"Michal Vasiľ","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66051abb39549a016495732a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4619492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Petr Chromčák","original_name":"Petr Chromčák","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66051a8bf90b19017ca83bad","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Radek Ševčík","original_name":"Radek Ševčík","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6475b6d4924ce600f97643e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Radek Ševčík","original_name":"Radek Ševčík","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6729237b5309b8a5b0472389","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29943235","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"tucnak.art","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sExc44gG6BrDHQ4mJgPPvolao3k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dkGvb13OnXTW1lTGJD2dXuag168.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
