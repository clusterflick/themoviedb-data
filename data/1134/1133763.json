Fending off impending debts, struggling to support his ever-drifting younger brother, Gabriel, and stumbling through life as a young professional, Jim is performing a tiresome balancing act, slowly losing the battle to the banality of adulthood. Nearing a mental breakdown, Jim leaves his claustrophobic Boston apartment to revisit his hometown in New Hampshire for the first time in seven years. There, he finds his childhood friend, Mark, living in absolute isolation repairing lawnmowers in his backyard to make a living. Now, awkwardly rekindling a lost relationship, the two friends must come to terms with the choices they've made, in search for a way to prevent a life lived in regret. A character-driven drama about the possibilities of the future and the fears that hold us back, \"Up and Down Again\" examines the complexities of friendship, adulthood, and the courage it takes to live the life you want.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Up and Down Again","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1537348","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
