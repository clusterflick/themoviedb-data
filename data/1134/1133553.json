Tackling Peace goes behind the scenes as young men from different sides of a bloody political war set aside a lifetime of prejudice and hostility to compete as a team in the Australian Football League's International Cup. Few of the aspirant players had ever heard of the game and none imagined befriending teammates from across the political divide.","popularity":0.4197,"poster_path":"/zmAX2aJnw9z1Y1e094qbEyosBJZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4023,"logo_path":null,"name":"GFN
