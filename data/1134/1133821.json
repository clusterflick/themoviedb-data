She collects photos from occasional visitors, mostly strangers, in the hope of remembering her long-lost daughter and granddaughter. She's ill-tempered, a bully to the other old people and to her caregivers. Until she meets Angel, a new caregiver who tempers her behavior. Love-hate relationship ensues between them, until Lola Edna snaps to hurt herself. Contemplative transformation follows and she eventually finds a friend in Angel who not only pampers her with utmost care and attention, but also reunites her with the other grannies and caregivers. On her 65th birthday, Angel surprises her with a revelation that changes their relation from being best buddies, to becoming inseparable soulmates and kindred-spirits.","popularity":0.1307,"poster_path":"/9jkih8Mzwd1XWLvPinxVkH4c1H7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155946,"logo_path":null,"name":"3:16 Media Network","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2023-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Litrato","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":33641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ai-Ai delas Alas","original_name":"Ai-Ai delas Alas","popularity":0.2954,"profile_path":"/eFPf8k6I0GcMUCvyTaQkxc1aegZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6475baaac2823a00c421a15e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":234554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ara Mina","original_name":"Ara Mina","popularity":1.4613,"profile_path":"/4paIbvNV7eGzZRM5ZVvBn0IgAea.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6475bad196386400de71b07a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1040549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liza Lorena","original_name":"Liza Lorena","popularity":0.19,"profile_path":"/3o8FwcyhWHqnke6iNcS6FdRYml4.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6475bae9dd2589012005d975","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bodjie Pascua","original_name":"Bodjie Pascua","popularity":0.1259,"profile_path":"/4mEDoZLmhm1KxrCOfl9nDUQPrnC.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6475bafb924ce600bfd43fce","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3353626,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Quinn Carrillo","original_name":"Quinn Carrillo","popularity":0.4536,"profile_path":"/wtp6O0jGupYHNwTzQsgRJxUH7q5.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6475bb0cdd258900a87a85cf","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1059361,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Gruta","original_name":"Joe Gruta","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":"/sTDtXvMwExpMCTDrlWoExGhS3sQ.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"64b68f7e78570e00c6d60071","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1492903,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louie Ignacio","original_name":"Louie Ignacio","popularity":0.0608,"profile_path":"/fCmCv6M3hrw5PbzE73km0baonpo.jpg","credit_id":"6475bb9896386400a8e6b36c","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932884,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ralston Jover","original_name":"Ralston Jover","popularity":0.0886,"profile_path":"/xxElklaeP6AQGLbOodO8YLVgeYN.jpg","credit_id":"6475bbbbdd258900a87a8626","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1492903,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louie Ignacio","original_name":"Louie Ignacio","popularity":0.0608,"profile_path":"/fCmCv6M3hrw5PbzE73km0baonpo.jpg","credit_id":"6475ba3fc2823a00a8d4d839","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28495019","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wAlcDTyU9Sp8dIHQFwpEAO6JPO1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1919}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1067,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9jkih8Mzwd1XWLvPinxVkH4c1H7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tl","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Litrato | Official Trailer","key":"V2ErwdfKDyc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-07-01T10:00:09.000Z","id":"64b7c7af55b0c000e2cb6c5b"}]}}}
