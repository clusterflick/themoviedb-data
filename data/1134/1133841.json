El caso del Ovis orientalis musimon en la isla de Tenerife: «El último muflón»","overview":"The mouflon, wild sheep with beautiful curved antlers, were brought to the island as an attraction. Nevertheless, they should not be admired but killed – to add variety to the pursuit of game or control the species numbers on the island. One animal becomes separated from the herd – will it manage to survive? Based on real events, the animation combines the symbolic images of the animal’s escape with the drastic photographs documenting the harm done to the species in Tenerife. The atmosphere of fear and anxiety is achieved by means of pulsating music and black and white colours.","popularity":0.0629,"poster_path":"/nuESVy3DJilC57IVHwTclifTn4y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21737,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tourmalet Films","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Biological Invasions.
