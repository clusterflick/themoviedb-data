Everybody except Jim. While his buddies head off to one Ivy League college or another, Jim rejects their upwardly-mobile choices and takes a job driving for the local cab company instead, which allows him plenty of free time to hang out, drink with the locals at John's Bar and Grill, and think back on the love affair with a married woman that, for the exquisite moment it lasted, brought passion and meaning to his life. Drawing partially on events from his own life, first time writer/director Peter Callahan tells a poignant and sometimes hilarious story about what happens when life moves on and you're not quite ready to move with it.","popularity":1.2383,"poster_path":"/kWLixNplOBlia5r3CDEZdChrB9B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Ball","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12790,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie Hofheimer","original_name":"Charlie Hofheimer","popularity":0.5194,"profile_path":"/9X9rK8v5JwYnjINXfOE0s6kHTTf.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jim","credit_id":"6597cd18726fb14a8fab2865","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":18657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurel Holloman","original_name":"Laurel Holloman","popularity":0.4186,"profile_path":"/c9cMysLLh0nWEAqNj3pp9nqq3MC.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Cathy","credit_id":"6597cd22d7a70a128f6a282f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Fitzpatrick","original_name":"Leo Fitzpatrick","popularity":0.279,"profile_path":"/iZG9G5DstChbwlL9mAQ727heZX.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Scooter","credit_id":"6597cd2ea698cf7edd439fc4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8986,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Rebhorn","original_name":"James Rebhorn","popularity":0.6675,"profile_path":"/jRdR3q28gTPQU6eWRgiIqzGuMKU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mr. Corcoran","credit_id":"6597cd39726fb14693ab2918","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1218282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin O'Rourke","original_name":"Kevin O'Rourke","popularity":0.5855,"profile_path":"/j0U6bGKY08fdfIRejRZiXJG1sBf.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Taxi Customer","credit_id":"67c84fe20c65ee9abae70bb4","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":140500,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Callahan","original_name":"Peter Callahan","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6597ccfbea37e0090c4bb681","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":140500,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Callahan","original_name":"Peter Callahan","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c84f69d7419cdfd86e3455","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1313829,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"David Tumblety","original_name":"David Tumblety","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c84f78830570d1fdc2a3e3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67810,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"John Gilroy","original_name":"John Gilroy","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":"/69tisbFpCtto4gPw4seJ8en7C1q.jpg","credit_id":"67c84f838fca0c0b03e6fe00","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Kozelek","original_name":"Mark Kozelek","popularity":0.1514,"profile_path":"/goaD10XAkosdcKNniQgXXdC0LtC.jpg","credit_id":"67c84fa7f067bcfd6d6e335e","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0212298","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kWLixNplOBlia5r3CDEZdChrB9B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Los Angeles Film Festival","release_date":"2001-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
