Birth and death, joy and sickness, youth and old age. In ‘Clinging’ Liat Glick focuses the camera on herself to tell a tender story about a trio made of a mature 47-year-old daughter without a partner or children, her mother and Natasha’s beloved aging dog. This subtle cinema, which applies semi-documentary means, focuses on the woman, her concerns and feelings. It is endearing with its authenticity and fairness revealing the most delicate sphere of the protagonist’s life. It remains close to a human without falling into any radicalism.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/ew5UnzKrc9AlymTzXmfsCA0aFir.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2023-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clinging","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1147538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liat Glick","original_name":"Liat Glick","popularity":0.0386,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64750c76c2823a00c421378c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4087853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nili Glick","original_name":"Nili Glick","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64750c7d96386400c1f374a1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1888652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amnon Fisher","original_name":"Amnon Fisher","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64750c8696386400c1f374a4","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1799885,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Omer Lotan","original_name":"Omer Lotan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cddb8799259c018625bee9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1147538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liat Glick","original_name":"Liat Glick","popularity":0.0386,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64750c686743fa00a99ec1f8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1147538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liat Glick","original_name":"Liat Glick","popularity":0.0386,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64750c4d6743fa00df862020","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1147538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liat Glick","original_name":"Liat Glick","popularity":0.0386,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64750c546743fa0136ee6981","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hSFygM6sTJh5XTlX5TToscEHqNs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1497,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ew5UnzKrc9AlymTzXmfsCA0aFir.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":998}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kraków Film Festival","release_date":"2023-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Przywiązanie / Clinging reż.
