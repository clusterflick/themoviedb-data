Future dreams, past failures, and the present struggles of daily life are captured in close-up over a nine-month period. Through conversations, anecdotes, arguments, and unpredictable emotional highs and lows, it sheds light on the myriad of issues triggered by adult children moving back in with their parents - a growing phenomenon in today's society. As the documentary unfolds, it becomes painfully clear that being a parent or a child is a lifelong calling that requires patience, compassion, and strength.","popularity":0.0733,"poster_path":"/keUUedn2vunUYaq3qQns7111XHr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201060,"logo_path":null,"name":"Makin' Movies","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2002-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In My Parents' Basement","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1254076,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maureen Judge","original_name":"Maureen Judge","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6474eed66743fa00df86169e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1254076,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maureen Judge","original_name":"Maureen Judge","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6474eee1c2823a00c4212e8c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0389029","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/keUUedn2vunUYaq3qQns7111XHr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"TVO","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Worldfest Houston Int'l Film Festival","release_date":"2002-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"In My Parents' Basement Trailer","key":"L9MBZ5oJSf0","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2010-01-22T20:50:33.000Z","id":"6474f126dd258900a87a11aa"}]}}}
