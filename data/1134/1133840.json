A beautiful and well-preserved palace in Berlin is frequented by tourists who visit its chambers, admire the paintings and walk around the meticulously well-tended garden, while thousands kilometres away there stands a dilapidated fortress. It is also visited by groups, which are patiently instructed by a guide as to why such a unique building was erected in Ghana. Moritz Siebert’s film is a remarkable documentary essay. On the example of the two eponymous buildings, the director has managed to capture the essence of colonialism.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GH","name":"Ghana"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Worldheritage - the Palace and its Fortress","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1576217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Moritz Siebert","original_name":"Moritz Siebert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6475d2ab1bf266043ecdcf70","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1576217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Moritz Siebert","original_name":"Moritz Siebert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6475d2c01bf266044026f43c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3214959,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hanna Keller","original_name":"Hanna Keller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6475d297dd2589012005e76f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1576217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Moritz Siebert","original_name":"Moritz Siebert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6475d2b21bf266043cd02ae2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1888190,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Maja Tennstedt","original_name":"Maja Tennstedt","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6475d2a0963864011848181d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kraków Film Festival","release_date":"2023-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
