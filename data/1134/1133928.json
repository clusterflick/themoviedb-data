At a film workshop, he receives a camera that will enable him to tell a story of the final weeks at his favourite place from his own perspective. In his musings about trifles as well as matters he cannot fully understand, he is accompanied by his best friend, Daniel. They experience the world in their own way and, at the same time, enable the viewer to see the reality through their eyes for a little while. Full of warmth and humour, the film is a story of friendship as a universal value that joins people regardless of any differences or limitations.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":"/4qHc3ZzbPdmEKsv8oZA3pqpnjh2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201128,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fundacja Edukacji i Sztuki","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2023-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Who Will Clean Your Windows?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088824,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dariusz Stawarz","original_name":"Dariusz Stawarz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"647610336743fa00fcdafb6d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Filipowski","original_name":"Daniel Filipowski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6476103b6743fa00fcdafb7a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088822,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dariusz Janiczak","original_name":"Dariusz Janiczak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64761011924ce600a75e09aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088822,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dariusz Janiczak","original_name":"Dariusz Janiczak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647610186743fa00c29bfd76","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088823,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mateusz Mirocha","original_name":"Mateusz Mirocha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"647610251bf2660441471601","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1418,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4qHc3ZzbPdmEKsv8oZA3pqpnjh2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":945}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kraków Film Festival","release_date":"2023-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Kto Ci będzie okna mył?
