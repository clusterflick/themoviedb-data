Now, the town must find a way to survive without its key economy until the day arrives when cruise visitors once again pour into its docks.","popularity":0.5096,"poster_path":"/q6jJHksYIyJjd1K0q14uTbpnOXL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162577,"logo_path":"/vaukK22bOILy1UrbIOmc6XMr2cs.png","name":"Wendover Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alaska's Silent Summer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3869445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Chase","original_name":"Adam Chase","popularity":0.167,"profile_path":"/vbOFIeF8szXKojul562255uKv8C.jpg","credit_id":"64754823963864011847b118","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3869446,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dave Wiskus","original_name":"Dave Wiskus","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/5vDyh27ARGKiJcr8p55IWXAJ9y8.jpg","credit_id":"64754875dd258901017f30e2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3869445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Chase","original_name":"Adam Chase","popularity":0.167,"profile_path":"/vbOFIeF8szXKojul562255uKv8C.jpg","credit_id":"6475482c1bf266043ecd75fc","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3869450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Denby","original_name":"Sam Denby","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":"/q8VZUWYGpev9wyozclocXBEaJfL.jpg","credit_id":"647547ef1bf266043d2fbeaf","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3869445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Chase","original_name":"Adam Chase","popularity":0.167,"profile_path":"/vbOFIeF8szXKojul562255uKv8C.jpg","credit_id":"6475484096386401353f962e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3542809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Doyle","original_name":"Ben Doyle","popularity":0.1058,"profile_path":"/e7VGRs0NgnFR64eoo7wLXGGb3A9.jpg","credit_id":"6475486abbcae000fb03278e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3869448,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"J.T.
