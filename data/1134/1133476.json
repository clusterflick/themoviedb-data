Supposedly, they lived in Greek forests. Some people who believe they really exist are willing to pay large sums for a meeting with them. In Hotel Centaur, located in picturesque surroundings, a group of colourful eccentrics organise a get-together. Young Greek cinema is definitely in a great shape. The story seems to engage in an intriguing dialogue with Jorgos Lanthimos’s films. It is a unique combination of a sublime from, the absurd, the sun and a social satire. The atmosphere and rhythm of the surprising script is intensified by the score composed by sound artist Dimitra Sofroniou.","popularity":0.0714,"poster_path":"/jOReA5J7ydv7KmwKZ2In8qSxBsk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201063,"logo_path":null,"name":"Good Stories
