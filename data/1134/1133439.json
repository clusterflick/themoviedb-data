The present depends on it and, what is more, it will always influence the future’, is what a father tells a teenage boy. When the first bombs fall, he will be faced with the choices determining the life of his family, friends, some unknown people and a turtle. ‘250 km’ is a true story which features a boy, its hero and participant. The entire cast was affected by the consequences of the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War in 2020. The film, however, tells the story of human solidarity in the face of the conflict but not the conflict itself. When terrible things happen and every second may determine life or death, life is put above all else, regardless of one’s affiliation with one’s own species.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"250 km","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3842990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vahe Sargsyan","original_name":"Vahe Sargsyan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6474f89c9638640118478b8f","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26296374","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
