That question's all too real for 22-year-old bohemian East Village artist Chloe, who's left with an unexpected pregnancy after a one-night stand with a sexy stranger. Battling ghosts of her past that she has tried to forget and facing an uncertain future, Chloe must choose between abortion or adoption, with either option leading to potentially dire consequences. Torn between her options, she finds comfort in the arms of a wild-child lesbian performance artist named Ana Blue and support in a mysterious stranger named Carlos, who may or may not be whom he appears to be. Chloe, A to Z deals with women's reproductive rights, pansexual relationships, and the ever-changing cityscape of New York. It features the spectacular locations of Coney Island, Times Square, and the East Village.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chloe, A to Z","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1482993","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
