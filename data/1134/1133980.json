This is a time for reflection on the social phenomenon that is Brexit - which has now become a British trademark world-over, alongside the Royal Family, fish and chips and Sherlock Holmes. Brexit Through The Non-Political Glass puts politicians and public sentiments to one side, and seeks the opinions of non-partisan world-class experts - the scholars and professional advisors who specialize in this very topic; no politicians and propagandists, and no social media and populism; among the experts is Vernon Bogdanor, the Oxford tutor of former British prime minister David Cameron, who was consulted before the referendum was offered to the nation; you will hear what his advice was.","popularity":2.556,"poster_path":"/eLaNSPeKw13gaBI2PL6WhcZjxXV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34679,"logo_path":"/cPk44BLr1wgQCRdvtpnMISkitMS.png","name":"Perfo Production","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":201136,"logo_path":null,"name":"Partisan Media","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brexit Through the Non-political Glass","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Bale","original_name":"Tim Bale","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"64762945924ce600dcb33d40","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2265865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Barnard","original_name":"Catherine Barnard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/nRpJYCOE6iRZUYjyIsggmam9dvn.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"647629651bf2660442a7aec1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vernon Bogdanor","original_name":"Vernon Bogdanor","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"647629791bf266043cd05505","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2316660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vida Breže","original_name":"Vida Breže","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6533cd98a0be2800fff7566b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":584938,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrej Štritof","original_name":"Andrej Štritof","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6533cb998cfcc7010af58441","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1585909,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aleš Pavlin","original_name":"Aleš Pavlin","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/nERlX5Mlw1QB3QmZvPu7rwcgSXM.jpg","credit_id":"6533cbb8c8a5ac0139aa50d6","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2316660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vida Breže","original_name":"Vida Breže","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6533cdbc8cfcc700aa020d59","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088979,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nina Kojima","original_name":"Nina Kojima","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64762ac7dd258901017fbd2b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088979,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nina Kojima","original_name":"Nina Kojima","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64762b49dd258900a87abd2c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088979,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nina Kojima","original_name":"Nina Kojima","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64762b5edd258900c3254cf1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088983,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tosh Kojima","original_name":"Tosh Kojima","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64762b811bf26604414722ab","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13616702","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fagPJbwKO0htThaI7NnIC9TdTbg.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eLaNSPeKw13gaBI2PL6WhcZjxXV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":525}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":225615,"name":"brexit"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Brexit Through the Non-Political Glass Film Trailer","key":"r7_HcaPJtPc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-04-05T15:57:03.000Z","id":"64766c0889d97f01337b7265"}]}}}
