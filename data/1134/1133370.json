Bordeland is an open stage on which the artist presents characters from Rudolf Wurlitzer’s novel Flats, leaving them to get on with their lives in the present, mingling their travellers’ tales with those of other characters, migrants whom no one wants to take in anymore. Over the course of a single night, when the lights of the electric city seem to have gone out, Melik Ohanian weaves a resonant tapestry of fragmented rhythms, Beat poetry and the nomadic lives of these celestial vagrants.","popularity":0.1832,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Borderland - I Walked a Far Piece","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2518077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Getenesh Berhe","original_name":"Getenesh Berhe","popularity":0.2987,"profile_path":"/yqPT0hdr7wiKV4xx53HSq22zxv4.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65bb659f11c0660162cfa5e8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1048566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theodore Bouloukos","original_name":"Theodore Bouloukos","popularity":0.1135,"profile_path":"/7NbjfvcLyTmP22PRlj7bdd5qhbN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65bb65a67646fd0184bdeb82","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1196944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Lombardi","original_name":"Steve Lombardi","popularity":0.0752,"profile_path":"/7MmwD8xvycHgEoFFql6zWjDOzWj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65bb65af2d1e4001635b6acb","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2084665,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vanessa Bergonzoli","original_name":"Vanessa Bergonzoli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bb65df459ad6017a6c2df8","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3548306,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melik Ohanian","original_name":"Melik Ohanian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bb65c6f03174017c679b01","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4512050,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dominique Quessada","original_name":"Dominique Quessada","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bb65d1cffeed017cadb253","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3548306,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melik Ohanian","original_name":"Melik Ohanian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bb65c07646fd0184bdebb6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8542928","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
