Now recognized at home and abroad, Louky Bersianik, Jovette Marchessault and Nicole Brossard have contributed greatly to the creation of a distinctive women's literature. Confirming that fresh approaches to literature are still possible, they have helped to heighten the awareness of the politics of language. Excerpts from their works vividly convey each woman's style, concerns and rhythms. They examine personal and global issues from a feminist perspective: human relationships, work, justice, poverty, loneliness, women's spirituality, and the future.","popularity":0.0918,"poster_path":"/52jRCnjcW3ZJ51Mv36z5anbFCMh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Firewords","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Firewords: Louky Bersianik, Jovette Marchessault, Nicole Brossard","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Les terribles vivantes: Louky Bersianik, Jovette Marchessault, Nicole Brossard","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louky Bersianik","original_name":"Louky Bersianik","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64756e216743fa0136eeadea","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jovette Marchessault","original_name":"Jovette Marchessault","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64756e286743fa00a99efdf8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2397617,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicole Brossard","original_name":"Nicole Brossard","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/ctekFNkg0js1WKXG7KWfJj7HPcX.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64756e346743fa0136eeae01","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3140159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pol Pelletier","original_name":"Pol Pelletier","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/b3VMzZqG998B0oAaHxC5pEqeZQM.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64756e3cbbcae000a8597c92","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1554702,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marthe Blackburn","original_name":"Marthe Blackburn","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64756e48dd258900a87a553a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raphaëlle Nadeau","original_name":"Raphaëlle Nadeau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"64756e52bbcae000de635031","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liz Hamilton","original_name":"Liz Hamilton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"64756e58dd258900e20c883b","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1139262,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dorothy Todd Hénaut","original_name":"Dorothy Todd Hénaut","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64756e14924ce600f97615c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11865014","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/52jRCnjcW3ZJ51Mv36z5anbFCMh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":507}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
