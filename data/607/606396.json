La scala di seta is one of the five one-act operas - farsa giocosa - in which the young Rossini first demonstrated his operatic genius.  This sparkling production continues the Rossini one-act opera series emerging from the Schwetzingen Festival. The staging is perfectly suited to the screen and the cast of principals, led by David Griffith and Luciana Serra provide musical excellence together with the flexible Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra.","popularity":0.2819,"poster_path":"/8DBicD2QKRjOS969B2JVZdr7yNX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2006-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Scala di Seta - Rossini","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":203527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Griffith","original_name":"David Griffith","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5cf3cfc49251412e55b99ec7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1065817,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luciana Serra","original_name":"Luciana Serra","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/2dcL7sb75szv1ACdEpNurz06jbe.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5cf3cfca0e0a2624ddcb2758","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1566954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alberto Rinaldi","original_name":"Alberto Rinaldi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66357a336611b40124674537","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":471358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alessandro Corbelli","original_name":"Alessandro Corbelli","popularity":0.06,"profile_path":"/9nOc6M9E2LGV9nOd7ECD6JgZ5Qo.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66357a5ed18572012834ccb9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1316066,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gianluigi Gelmetti","original_name":"Gianluigi Gelmetti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"66357ab783ee67012d40f56a","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Hampe","original_name":"Michael Hampe","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/rn7dnuMeZI4ZvZXjtaGDlN5e0cK.jpg","credit_id":"5cf3d0010e0a2619d3cb5779","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2328034,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simone Young","original_name":"Simone Young","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/nfk4e2r0j4D4vFVNjsXBHZqIbD3.jpg","credit_id":"5cf3cff692514167e8b9bb53","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8DBicD2QKRjOS969B2JVZdr7yNX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
