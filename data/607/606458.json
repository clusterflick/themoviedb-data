Until today, the European Institutions have not given a clear answer. The EU has still to recognize water as a human right, as the UN did in 2010. Up To The Last Drop follows the money and the corporate interests during a period of four years in thirteen cities of six EU countries. It’s a documentary film about water that reflects contemporary European values and the quality of the current European democracy.","popularity":0.099,"poster_path":"/8hyLLoQ4fEFwyA5ydYZBdhayyfA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7255,"logo_path":"/aHu0SirjV9Mi0OrlnFWqZwy50wW.png","name":"EPT","origin_country":"GR"},{"id":13837,"logo_path":null,"name":"K.G.
