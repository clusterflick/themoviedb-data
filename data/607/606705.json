After a short narrative showing U.S. Ambassador Robert Livingston (Val Winter) negotiating the purchase with Napoleon and Tallyrand, the rest of the film, guided by Livingston's spirit, visits the 1953 territory of the purchase and shows the growth of such former outposts as Minneapolis, Minnesota; Des Moines, Iowa; St. Louis, Missouri; Kansas City, Missouri and Kansas, and Little Rock, Arkansas. Most of the footage is given to New Orleans, Louisiana and its Vieux Carre, docks, business district and museums, ending with the preparation for that city's annual Mardi Gras.","popularity":0.0423,"poster_path":"/hDjrzfITN8fWCs0MOE7Xd66WsnI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105710,"logo_path":null,"name":"RKO Path√© Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":6,"logo_path":"/n53F7K9scQWFXYbrCablqLKqJdp.png","name":"RKO Radio Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1953-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Louisiana Territory","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2329248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Val Winter","original_name":"Val Winter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Ambassador Robert Livingston","credit_id":"5cf5e46d0e0a26169fcc18e1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2329249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Zinser","original_name":"Leo Zinser","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Charles Talleyrand","credit_id":"5cf5e47cc3a36811731dcf04","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2329250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julian Meister","original_name":"Julian Meister","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"George Benton","credit_id":"5cf5e48ac3a36839e424576f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2329251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phyliss Massicot","original_name":"Phyliss Massicot","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Phyllis Caldwell","credit_id":"5cf5e49a0e0a2619d3cfdc84","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2329252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marlene Behrens","original_name":"Marlene Behrens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Jane Benton","credit_id":"5cf5e4a6c3a36811731dcf2a","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34229,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"George Bassman","original_name":"George Bassman","popularity":0.1769,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dbfbe37f1b5710015e83459","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1613935,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Harry W.
