Her search will take her into every strata of Indian society, from the quiet office of the respected doctor who performed the operation, to the teeming slums that are home to the desperate poor who have nothing to sell but their blood. Her story is paralleled by the tale of two young male lovers torn apart by societyâ€™s demands and their dread of this new disease, and a young slum dweller who refuses to let fear destroy his compassion.","popularity":0.1057,"poster_path":"/d20u0vY0xiggzK4SvY7U1f8hK0b.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Long Live Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1140663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mita Vashisht","original_name":"Mita Vashisht","popularity":0.3528,"profile_path":"/mcnaQTCmuz3lXNotFFdkwCO7FTY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Botanist","credit_id":"60f95c97df857c0045b23066","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":980175,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sumitra Bhave","original_name":"Sumitra Bhave","popularity":0.0705,"profile_path":"/gqMeU8Hz8bWayiQ05kwGnoN1yrz.jpg","credit_id":"5cf5b15f9251411882c17d04","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":980176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sunil Sukthankar","original_name":"Sunil Sukthankar","popularity":0.0427,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cf5b1659251412422ba447e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0256534","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d20u0vY0xiggzK4SvY7U1f8hK0b.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mqMr88VE4976rgcUU4ffwhWTsUA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
