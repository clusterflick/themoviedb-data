Everything is displayed behind glass wallsâ€“ people, actions, novelties, food items. It's the reconstruction of a culture that belongs to the other side of the world. A culture descended from a people that had departed their homeland. Through the glass's surface reflections, the artist sees reflections of himself and remembers sounds from his recent past and echoes of his own departures.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/4RqNXpHxInN4J0q4UufVfBBpLdd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Museum Of Departures","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2110839,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gautam Valluri","original_name":"Gautam Valluri","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/crX39XucaR5YrQysyhKWqQDELGg.jpg","credit_id":"5cf4b44e0e0a261186cd8aa3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5565258","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":915,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4RqNXpHxInN4J0q4UufVfBBpLdd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":610}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
