Saverio Mercadante’s adventure opera was a great success at its premiere in 1839 and apparently made a lasting impression on the young Giuseppe Verdi. Already famed for rescuing works from oblivion, the Wexford Festival now brings Il bravo back into the limelight.  Il Bravo, the assassin, prowls the streets of Venice at night. A long time ago, he killed his wife in a crime passionnel, whereupon the Council of Ten, the most important executive body of the Republic of Venice, made him their secret assassin. And just to make sure Il Bravo does their bidding, they hold his father hostage. Everything changes when the banished patrician Pisani makes advances on the fair Violetta, whom Il Bravo has been charged with protecting. And who is the mysterious courtesan Teodora?","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":"/parteF86z0IdX0AASYmLdOICRg0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il bravo - Mercadante","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2115479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rubens Pelizzari","original_name":"Rubens Pelizzari","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5cf62be39251416fe8b97b5d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2329365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ioana Pipelea","original_name":"Ioana Pipelea","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5cf62bea0e0a26169fcc89fd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2329366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Shaffrey","original_name":"Richard Shaffrey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5cf62bf192514146dcb8a3f2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2329367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gustavo Castillo","original_name":"Gustavo Castillo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5cf62bfd0e0a2619d3d05280","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2329368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alessandro Luciano","original_name":"Alessandro Luciano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5cf62c080e0a261186d01dc8","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2329369,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Renaud Doucet","original_name":"Renaud Doucet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cf62c16c3a3681e9521494e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/parteF86z0IdX0AASYmLdOICRg0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
