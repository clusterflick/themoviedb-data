His paper boat, assembled from a Derry News newspaper with care by his older brother Bill, had careened down a sewer drain on its doomed maiden voyage and into the hands of what—not who—would be Georgie's killer. But what if Pennywise the Dancing Clown hadn’t killed Georgie after all? What if Georgie had somehow escaped death and managed to live some semblance of a normal life in the not-so-normal town of Derry? What might his world look like? Or that of the Denbrough family? Would this horrific experience color their view of the universe?","popularity":0.5655,"poster_path":"/jMfw4S3zTdzduOLKjozjVQztC6q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":237337,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fright
