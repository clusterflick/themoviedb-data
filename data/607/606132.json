The result is a collective interpretation improvising its way through an aesthetic landscape defined by violent contradictions. Resolution abuts eternity, eroticism asceticism, spiritual ecstasy physical torture. Together, the music and its interpreters conjure something like what William Blake famously called the marriage of heaven and hell.","popularity":0.5657,"poster_path":"/dwHm8ycIgKz3ABIu8phEfE5lTb3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Apparition of the Eternal Church","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":17114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Cameron Mitchell","original_name":"John Cameron Mitchell","popularity":0.4642,"profile_path":"/iDyhkjtgy7U8xl9tKk9xcJA3yEY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63ab84b9be4b3600b63a3ecb","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":240789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackie Beat","original_name":"Jackie Beat","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/707khdIfrUhWKGX2jrlRz2hl9yS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63ab84c309dda400ad9dbc8a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":36563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justin Vivian Bond","original_name":"Justin Vivian Bond","popularity":0.1637,"profile_path":"/fEhgs6Bu8Wj91fUJ36b01rT0nBz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63ab84c8a24c5000cfab69e8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1024241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Matronic","original_name":"Ana Matronic","popularity":0.2064,"profile_path":"/pXyePcL446iaECSDDtI6xABj93O.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63ab8518c8113d00ae3f6ea4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59722,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Daniel Handler","original_name":"Daniel Handler","popularity":0.1285,"profile_path":"/A83HnjYRdSlmuWybm8jgCuOCTt7.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63ab851ec8113d00c88e33cd","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2326695,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Festa","original_name":"Paul Festa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cf206a80e0a2619cccb5b56","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0810758","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dwHm8ycIgKz3ABIu8phEfE5lTb3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1010}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6154,"name":"hell"},{"id":161207,"name":"catholicism"},{"id":188709,"name":"organ music"},{"id":254974,"name":"messiaen"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
