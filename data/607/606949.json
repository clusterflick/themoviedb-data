The footage was shot at Christmas 1992, in Berlin. Claudia, 13, wants to show her mother \"that kids can do what they want\". 13-year-old Danny thinks Germany’s lousy, having lived on the streets for two years. His mother doesn’t try to contact him any more. Jonas, 13, is convinced that a bright future lies ahead of him. He shifts between his parents’ house and the streets, but feels most at home in a street riot. 13-year-old Daniela doesn’t want to leave home, despite suffering at the violent hands of her father. We meet her in a women’s refuge centre. David, 13, shows the director, his father, first-hand what street children go through and the pain they inflict upon their parents.","popularity":0.065,"poster_path":"/qBcARVsjx9BtuSsm9kVz9rYx6n2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72750,"logo_path":"/nvDTUVfgu0KEDs8wuod74e6sLM6.png","name":"DEFA-Studio für Wochenschau und Dokumentarfilme","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1993-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unsere bösen Kinder","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2294265,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jürgen Hoffmann","original_name":"Jürgen Hoffmann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621222cca84ff70020d821d7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1276545,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karl Heinz Lotz","original_name":"Karl Heinz Lotz","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/m8O1sxZIRU0SMi6QelHoxubpzfk.jpg","credit_id":"6212219f0e4fc8004408954c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3435127,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Egbert Lipowski","original_name":"Egbert Lipowski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621221d341465c001b8798d8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":65469,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Karin Schöning","original_name":"Karin Schöning","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621222de44a424006c675e11","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2116980,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andreas Aigmüller","original_name":"Andreas Aigmüller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621222f31d53860043035fd5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1276545,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karl Heinz Lotz","original_name":"Karl Heinz Lotz","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/m8O1sxZIRU0SMi6QelHoxubpzfk.jpg","credit_id":"5cf796089251416fe8bbb9ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0402560","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/qBcARVsjx9BtuSsm9kVz9rYx6n2.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":707},{"aspect_ratio":0.734,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/upWpB2WYWgIoXbbNLfn8dwNOgnS.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
