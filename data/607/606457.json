With neither knowing what will come out of their awkward and less than ideal meeting, they more or less stumble into loving each other, and find excuses to spend every moment together. As their relationship grows they embark on a mutual journey to find the deeper meaning within their work and their lives, and ultimately put their newfound love to a test they may very well not
