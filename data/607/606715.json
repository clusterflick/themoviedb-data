Coverage of women's sport lags far behind men's, and focuses on female athletes' femininity and sexuality over their achievements on the court and field. While female athleticism challenges gender norms, women athletes continue to be depicted in traditional roles that reaffirm their femininity - as wives and mothers or sex objects. By comparison, male athletes are framed according to heroic masculine ideals that honor courage, strength, and endurance.","popularity":0.1364,"poster_path":"/cnaFvEVgZBjsrpSczwOLJHl0FhQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27072,"logo_path":"/6kSyzXASYqFyD7HVPg32rTsprjd.png","name":"Media Education Foundation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Media Image of the Female Athlete","title":"Playing Unfair","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Media image of the female athlete","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1184450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sut Jhally","original_name":"Sut Jhally","popularity":0.0778,"profile_path":"/a06JwBtL1mO2rQM2jILcvTf6NUX.jpg","credit_id":"65569d4bd051d900adb4b0a4","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1297594,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Loretta Alper","original_name":"Loretta Alper","popularity":0.0657,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cf5f2130e0a26169fcc27a1","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2329279,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kenyon King","original_name":"Kenyon King","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cf5f22b9251416737b843a6","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cnaFvEVgZBjsrpSczwOLJHl0FhQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
