The narrator, an aroma specialist, describes a drug derived from a mythical flower with miraculous properties that might produce empathy in humans, enabling them to know what is being felt by a pink river dolphin or an angry teenager. Through her work, Yi explores ways in which our senses are culturally conditioned. Blending elements of documentary, dream and bio-fiction, The Flavor Genome anticipates a renewal in the perception of nature influenced by new scientific and technological discoveries.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Flavor Genome","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2326998,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anicka Yi","original_name":"Anicka Yi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cf282a3c3a3684bf021264d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7125274","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
