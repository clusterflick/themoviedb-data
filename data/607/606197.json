He embarks on a new life as an Uber driver in Kochi while working on his graphic novel titled ‘Pixelia’. One day a transgender woman named Mandakini gets into his cab and that day changes Kumar’s life forever. Kumar and Mandakini spend the whole day where they open each other’s minds. Mandakini shares her past life and her desire to adopt a child while Kumar narrates the story of his graphic novel to her. Gradually a bonding ensues between Kumar and Mandakini making Kumar realise about his queer identity. As they start a relationship, Kumar gets into deeper conflicts regarding adopting a child, as adoption by queer parents is realistically difficult in a country like India. Pixelia, a movie with a stylistic blend of documentary and magical realism talks about the fragmentation in our daily lives.","popularity":0.1711,"poster_path":"/7YwUXlM0XPd9l8IRG6REYq3Uj2L.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pixelia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2328171,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sanal Aman","original_name":"Sanal Aman","popularity":0.0856,"profile_path":"/gBvuoXboNmtj0fiKg7GMzQVF75r.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5cf3f62b9251416948ba1c67","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2328172,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gowri Savithri","original_name":"Gowri Savithri","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/cpM72B9t0I6ofqvNObYff6wjG3v.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5cf3f630c3a36839e4204d37","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1333818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vijay Menon","original_name":"Vijay Menon","popularity":0.173,"profile_path":"/tB9qpkqCzVfu0dyaE7a775EnOnE.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5cf3f63d0e0a2624ddcb9e3a","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2015059,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ratheesh Ravindran","original_name":"Ratheesh Ravindran","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cf3f6180e0a2670bdcff64a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eVbfyMamwNnTxIAzvLW8Bqt6Fhb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f683Tn32JCcQPuf2wvkJtroT41X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.716,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7YwUXlM0XPd9l8IRG6REYq3Uj2L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":573},{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":1148,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pctB6XtNzjwXEBCXBE09Nve8ySq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
