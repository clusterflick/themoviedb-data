With its sky-high windows looking out onto the corner of Castro and Market, this landmark establishment stands not only as one of the gayborhood’s most beloved establishments but also as a testament to the revolutionary idea that gay people should be seen and celebrated rather than hide in the darkness of alleys and blacked-out windows. Whether you’re a regular who thinks of the bar as “Cheers for Queers” or a passerby, this snappy locally-produced documentary is chock-full of familiar faces and fascinating stories. Deeply personal interviews provide a history of this lesbian-owned bar as well as the Castro area—a blue collar Irish-Italian community in the ‘60s that became a gay mecca in the ‘70s, endured the health crisis of the ‘80s, and has served as a sense of home, family, and emotional nourishment for so many in our community every day of its 47-year history.","popularity":0.2087,"poster_path":"/ktxAw38o4mkxyignkkxV5HVSPOj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Through the Windows","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":7998,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Bret Parker","original_name":"Bret Parker","popularity":0.2904,"profile_path":"/gGjVAlMsdEVti2StoS4FZRaw2Xf.jpg","credit_id":"5cf195ca0e0a2679e4cb37b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2326456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Petey Barma","original_name":"Petey Barma","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cf195bac3a3682d1b1ebeb0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":7998,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Bret Parker","original_name":"Bret Parker","popularity":0.2904,"profile_path":"/gGjVAlMsdEVti2StoS4FZRaw2Xf.jpg","credit_id":"5e178779a9117f0018c91ebb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1994305,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anna Wolitzky","original_name":"Anna Wolitzky","popularity":0.0625,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e17878ecf4b8b0011822378","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":567205,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jake Monaco","original_name":"Jake Monaco","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":"/fvusYTZwIy953k01dOC6gsRQsvY.jpg","credit_id":"5e178781c2f44b0012bf4d65","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1033687,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Adam Habib","original_name":"Adam Habib","popularity":0.0682,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e178788c2f44b0012bf4d76","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8991756","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/koo0DP9EWQqXcVnTJlptMmOMHYZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ktxAw38o4mkxyignkkxV5HVSPOj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
