His figure became shrouded in mystery when she discovered that he was gay and the murder ‘’gay-related’’. Confronting her own grief in the deeply personal Theme: Murder, Swtzoff uncovers scores of journals and letters, and contacts former friends of her father to assemble a portrait of a man curiously obsessed with death, who may have led a rich, gay life in ‘50s and ‘60s Boston – a man who had not only secrets, but an entirely separate life.","popularity":0.0481,"poster_path":"/ipEEnCaZWABgLCLMqW6Vwds7yUe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Theme: Murder","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2330045,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martha Swetzoff","original_name":"Martha Swetzoff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cf730d0c3a3686d031def3d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0168219","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ipEEnCaZWABgLCLMqW6Vwds7yUe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
