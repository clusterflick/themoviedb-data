Born into a powerful newspaper-magnate family, from an early age Lucy defined her worth by her ability to write. Despite early success, she was struck with severe anorexia and underwent brutal treatment in mental institutions, only to survive, pen her first best-seller, and ultimately win a Guggenheim Prize in literature - all before the age of 22. The first of its kind, this hybrid documentary weaves together 'relational' recreations, animated dream sequences, constructed worlds and intimate interviews to tell a worthwhile story of survival and creativity, filtered through the eyes of filmmaker and subject.","popularity":0.0393,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In So Many Words","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310079,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elisabeth Haviland James","original_name":"Elisabeth Haviland James","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"534c98c70e0a2661ad0004f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2920969,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ashley Melzer","original_name":"Ashley Melzer","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f470c5a313b800e42630d7","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2317407","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
