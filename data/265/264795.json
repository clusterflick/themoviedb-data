This is the final work in a suite of 7 videos made over the last decade; the previous works include ‘Lip’ 1999, ‘Artist’ 2000, ‘Love’ 2003, ‘Doomed’ 2007, ‘Revolution’ 2008 and ‘Mother’ 2009. 'Other' is one of the most mesmerising of the series as it edits together scenes of interracial encounters. It opens with first contact sequences, films in which the beach and the shallow waters are a zone of encounter between ships and canoes, between Europeans and non-Europeans. It then moves to images of looking, of two different peoples meeting for the first time and appraising each other visually. As imagined by Hollywood and TV directors, this is a moment of both curiosity and desire, where glances become lingering and erotically charged.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/wiz37HqyzFACW31x9FSEGkz8ex8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Other","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1121253,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tracey Moffatt","original_name":"Tracey Moffatt","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/yVHCfGmY488q8BUkJSk8VEH7otd.jpg","credit_id":"57ebba0cc3a36868bd00592c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1383,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wiz37HqyzFACW31x9FSEGkz8ex8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":922}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
