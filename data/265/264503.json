Simply get out of the GDR and go to the West to realize his life's dream and study physics. Suddenly, in the historic summer of 1989, his dream becomes reality. The Hungarian-Austrian border is surprisingly opened and the first refugees ask for asylum at the German embassy in Budapest. When Andreas spends his vacation with his parents at a campsite in Hungary, he takes the opportunity and tries to escape to the west at night and in fog.","popularity":0.4171,"poster_path":"/2w0bqig73rEXGZKre73Qstz6ZOm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Einfach raus","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabian Busch","original_name":"Fabian Busch","popularity":0.2036,"profile_path":"/aPwhdQSEvHIFwzMYRCcx7WIUZW2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Andreas Hallbrandt","credit_id":"534aea36c3a3682de4001ce6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":16718,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cosma Shiva Hagen","original_name":"Cosma Shiva Hagen","popularity":0.2697,"profile_path":"/tB0agfC2ELzvkFww98TIup9IrT3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Martina Reimann","credit_id":"534aea4cc3a3682e07001cc0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6271,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inga Busch","original_name":"Inga Busch","popularity":0.1491,"profile_path":"/zZIQkzz39WcuuXOmfoBJwdt5qg0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Michelle","credit_id":"534aea5dc3a3682ddf001bc3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":19123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susanne Lothar","original_name":"Susanne Lothar","popularity":0.2474,"profile_path":"/51CyaN2rUTqvIiidOdOGvAyEGk6.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Renate Reimann","credit_id":"534aea76c3a3682ded001ca5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ulrich Mühe","original_name":"Ulrich Mühe","popularity":0.5934,"profile_path":"/kdqKmnaBDDT0cwTE2C3fKDJrF8D.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Manfred Reimann","credit_id":"534aea8ec3a3682ded001cab","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":48613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renate Krößner","original_name":"Renate Krößner","popularity":0.3197,"profile_path":"/A0me7L0bry9O37qe7PiC4nQbfiE.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Karin Hallbrandt","credit_id":"534aeaa4c3a3682df6001cf8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Brandner","original_name":"Michael Brandner","popularity":0.2751,"profile_path":"/bkQabOS0UuvOvNcOOvEG0C1st0C.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dieter Korn","credit_id":"534aeabdc3a3682dd1001bb9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8205,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Gruber","original_name":"Marie Gruber","popularity":0.2256,"profile_path":"/a6tspybRaqckZnFag7JFrkJ5wfy.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mutter von Hans","credit_id":"56a69e6e92514129fe000954","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lars Gärtner","original_name":"Lars Gärtner","popularity":0.1181,"profile_path":"/KIvUMbd6UMEUDDkvAro6isOxQQ.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Michelles Flirt","credit_id":"5aff45300e0a26468e0006a3","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2045525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Kraushaar","original_name":"Oliver Kraushaar","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Harry Delnhardt","credit_id":"5aff45439251413124000658","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":175330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabrina Rattey","original_name":"Sabrina Rattey","popularity":0.1315,"profile_path":"/fltuxrjw5gC69cMvfu31nO12h1l.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Anke","credit_id":"5aff454f0e0a26467f0007d6","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Veit Stübner","original_name":"Veit Stübner","popularity":0.2303,"profile_path":"/3w8tzqhX5vrTL30FScFbZUPXQky.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Mitarbeiter Botschaft","credit_id":"5aff45600e0a26468e0006b3","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1306562,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Vogel","original_name":"Peter Vogel","popularity":0.107,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"534aea22c3a3682df6001ce9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0204295","wikidata_id":"Q1307132","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2w0bqig73rEXGZKre73Qstz6ZOm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":522}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"6","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
