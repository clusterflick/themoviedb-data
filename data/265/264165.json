While seeking harmony, order and perfection in every aspect of their lives, they built minimalistic furniture and buildings that influenced modern design. The Shakers wrote songs of exquisite beauty and danced to the point of ecstasy during their religious meetings. Inspired by this music and dance, choreographer Tero Saarinen created Borrowed Light, a dance piece about communal life and individual sacrifice. Shot in Finland and the United States, featuring interviews and excerpts from Borrowed Light, this documentary explore the cultural legacy of this religious group devoted to creating heaven on earth.","popularity":1.5172,"poster_path":"/A3oxO9NnvHh9YmpEAfjxXDpJBHQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162781,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ciné Qua Non
