Matthias (Matthias Eysen) is already a misfit and has trouble meeting society's expectations. When he is picked up by the police for a minor crime, the brutal indifference with which he is treated wounds him in ways which are not healed by his being found innocent and being released.","popularity":0.1632,"poster_path":"/rm2rXrKnHOSqQ7IvHwDvwkKgxs9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1973-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Experts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2741,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Sedlmayr","original_name":"Walter Sedlmayr","popularity":0.3474,"profile_path":"/9cESnCVgyYbWnJzLEMkyyqm6G1U.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"57e45e65c3a3682ce900712a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1366095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathias Eysen","original_name":"Mathias Eysen","popularity":0.1317,"profile_path":"/xngH4AgLLmGeGDgBI3klHmF0RZd.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6160c5d422f5d70091801a7c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":51433,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Wolfgang Ebert","original_name":"Wolfgang Ebert","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6160c5dbe004a6004493aa4d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3263714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernst Battenberg","original_name":"Ernst Battenberg","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6160c5e233ec26004567093c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3263715,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eckhard Langmann","original_name":"Eckhard Langmann","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6160c5e7a06645009530b29a","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1044791,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norbert Kückelmann","original_name":"Norbert Kückelmann","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"534ded1a0e0a2679dc000d18","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1476554,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alfred Tichawsky","original_name":"Alfred Tichawsky","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6160c5f433ec260028eca5ad","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1044791,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norbert Kückelmann","original_name":"Norbert Kückelmann","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6160c5fcaa659e002accc443","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0163188","wikidata_id":"Q1215920","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rm2rXrKnHOSqQ7IvHwDvwkKgxs9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
