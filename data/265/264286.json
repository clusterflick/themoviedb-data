With their usual blend of happy go lucky snowboarding, skiing and an extensive and technical skateboarding segment, Voleurz’ once again has conquered their quest to do their part in helping break down barriers between action sports with their most unique and entertaining film yet. Highlights include action-packed segments from snowboarders Barry Hartman, Braden Dean, Justin VDP and Shayne Zwickel; a trip to Sweden with Canada’s top freeskiers TJ Schiller, Ian Cosco, and Justin Dorey; skateboard segments from Vancouvers rising talent Tyler Holm and Corey Klim; and a mid-summer heli shoot at the Camp of Champions on the Blackcomb glacier.","popularity":0.2668,"poster_path":"/uco9UKX1Gv9SzZjEZwutXaR7L49.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":233155,"logo_path":"/s2YH8yj7MSYg9opplR7cHcSsEF1.png","name":"Voleurz","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2010-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Look on the Bright Side","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4814405,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darren Rayner","original_name":"Darren Rayner","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6689945a59f524f59bd501ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mwfKkB89euBUuiGPF9lHpcXjjmC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uco9UKX1Gv9SzZjEZwutXaR7L49.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":3522,"name":"snowboarding"},{"id":248915,"name":"skiing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
