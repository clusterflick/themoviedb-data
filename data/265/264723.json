He feels victimized enough, both for the prison time and for the crime which led to it; he committed the crime to give his wife the nice things she asked him for. When he discovers that she has remarried a quite wealthy man, he is outraged. However, his ire is not due to her disloyalty to him; he loved their only son to distraction, and now the boy has no knowledge or memory of him.","popularity":0.2549,"poster_path":"/7RTlhGd1n1vpw2EEtdhr2txxw4h.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61617,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinépol","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1293,"logo_path":"/4r2EdENtYK1Ddxmciod3XvmfA9k.png","name":"Office
