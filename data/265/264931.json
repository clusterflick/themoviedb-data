The warning is clear, stop expanding into space and prepare to be subjugated. Earth sends out their most competent troubleshooters: The Crasher Squad! Renowned for their skills at keeping the peace, they find their abilities are lacking against an opponent who can swallow star systems; and has. Not that the Earth represents anything more than a casual desire, but Zule has not gotten where he is by allowing the weaker species to flourish.
