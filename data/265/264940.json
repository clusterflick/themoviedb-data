A small consolation for her is the fact that Mannsfeld is not about a womanizer, but that he is serious about his love for Corinna. The only thing standing in the way of this love is his wife, who, despite the broken marriage, does not want to let Mannsfeld go. When the wife is murdered, this crime seems to bring dubious happiness to the two of them - but it doesn't last long.","popularity":0.5204,"poster_path":"/sk9k8qhQJboqWApCJTWtdvyT6kt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20803,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arca-Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1956-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Corinna Darling","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1039351,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisabeth Müller","original_name":"Elisabeth Müller","popularity":0.2066,"profile_path":"/owCMErCofOgyQ1GGnWmZwt3Ug7a.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Corinna Stephan","credit_id":"534e5fb0c3a36867a100120f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18546,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Söhnker","original_name":"Hans Söhnker","popularity":0.1286,"profile_path":"/k5f3c5WZpPRYINxPR3gFOkBUW3d.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Peter Mansfeld","credit_id":"534e5fc3c3a36867a1001212","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":46039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannelore Schroth","original_name":"Hannelore Schroth","popularity":0.1311,"profile_path":"/1pPdox3wDLQMwefuoRPoxZ39qdx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dagmar Mansfeld","credit_id":"534e5fd3c3a368678e0011d6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Kerst","original_name":"Alexander Kerst","popularity":0.2939,"profile_path":"/bYq2JI5uSqXwcwjJ46MglTXJddp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dr. Suter","credit_id":"534e5fe1c3a368678800120c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klaus Kinski","original_name":"Klaus Kinski","popularity":1.1211,"profile_path":"/twuyGlZJzJXFcbhVS2jlQOsTVFK.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Klaus Brockmann","credit_id":"534e5ff2c3a3686795001181","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":11931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Rosar","original_name":"Annie Rosar","popularity":0.1014,"profile_path":"/wDCJT9HbTrxXOFcHNBYCvmj3X9J.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Frau Suter","credit_id":"534e6000c3a3686795001183","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolfgang Gruner","original_name":"Wolfgang Gruner","popularity":0.1555,"profile_path":"/nL3jhsl75AZGFzJwFZnvqRsj944.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Inspizient am Theater","credit_id":"534e6011c3a3686795001185","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valéry Inkijinoff","original_name":"Valéry Inkijinoff","popularity":0.1452,"profile_path":"/84zCATkouIK65gzI3ryZ8sQPnPc.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Chin","credit_id":"59c79f48c3a368140305bcca","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Panos Papadopulos","original_name":"Panos Papadopulos","popularity":0.1152,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Longo","credit_id":"59c79f5c9251415b540567b8","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ah Yue Lou","original_name":"Ah Yue Lou","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Suka","credit_id":"59c79f709251415b7705c0db","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1193299,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eduard von Borsody","original_name":"Eduard von Borsody","popularity":0.0554,"profile_path":"/qhXfWw2lm4xXyKCKnifFV6wWgkD.jpg","credit_id":"534e5f9fc3a36867a100120d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0049253","wikidata_id":"Q4884598","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":1403,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sk9k8qhQJboqWApCJTWtdvyT6kt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":818,"name":"based on novel or book"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1956-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
