The film covers Mozart's creative output from ages seven to 20. Compositions written after the film's time frame are also heard on the omnipresent soundtrack. As a bonus to music purists, the original orchestrations -- and original instruments -- are utilized.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1976-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":224,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mozart: Recordings of a Youth","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1612079,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klaus Kirschner","original_name":"Klaus Kirschner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5721a59ac3a3681181002828","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0071865","wikidata_id":"Q106717055","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
