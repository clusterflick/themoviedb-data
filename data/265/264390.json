The film describes an intersecting universe of entrenched power--in which the landowning class, colluding priests, corrupt government officials, violent police, and U.S. businessmen--conspiring to rape the land for their own profit and to suppress the local farmers. In contrast, the working peasants cherish the land as their own and struggle to break free from oppression to build homes and better lives for their families.","popularity":0.0938,"poster_path":"/pMvgHdclnkaZCKg0kZhEgWEbja5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15636,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alta Loma Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":190217,"logo_path":null,"name":"Producciones Cinematográficas SK","origin_country":"HN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HN","name":"Honduras"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2003-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Calixto the Landlord","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Luis López","original_name":"José Luis López","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Calixto","credit_id":"5349e4c20e0a2640c2000a47","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saúl Toro","original_name":"Saúl Toro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5349e4cc0e0a2640b9000ad7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309467,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Vasquez","original_name":"Daniel Vasquez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5349e4d40e0a2640c5000ae5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marisela Bustillo","original_name":"Marisela Bustillo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5349e4db0e0a2640bf000bbb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eduardo Bähr","original_name":"Eduardo Bähr","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5349e4ee0e0a2640c5000aeb","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309462,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sami Kafati","original_name":"Sami Kafati","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5349e4a80e0a2640cb000b57","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309462,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sami Kafati","original_name":"Sami Kafati","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"573baa19c3a3683b0b00053c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0368081","wikidata_id":"Q6043806","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pMvgHdclnkaZCKg0kZhEgWEbja5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
