There he finds nothing but hardship and rejection, save from the town's mayor and a young servant girl, whom he marries. Ridiculed and abused, with practically no work, he turns to drink and one night accidentally kills his wife. The child of their marriage is taken away from him, and at this point he is left with the options of becoming a robber, starving to death, or emigrating.","popularity":0.2703,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":210,"logo_path":"/cuIR8m2nnKkqPgnQz25FJT26aBa.png","name":"Süddeutscher Rundfunk","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1627,"logo_path":"/kx8kRT0rStw6SVEJKgbknFyITA4.png","name":"Maran Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":17994,"logo_path":null,"name":"Independent Film GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1975-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Glückstadt","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23721,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dieter Laser","original_name":"Dieter Laser","popularity":0.4634,"profile_path":"/xBhIIbhkFV0M0WRBokHXPS7zUYq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"John Hansen, genannt 'John Glückstadt'","credit_id":"5353c34e0e0a26561400493b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":24393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-Christine Barrault","original_name":"Marie-Christine Barrault","popularity":0.314,"profile_path":"/uKaE6e4u3IuhhYslqtmICc2GssY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hanna Hansen","credit_id":"5353c35d0e0a26561400493f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tilo Prückner","original_name":"Tilo Prückner","popularity":0.4565,"profile_path":"/738zamuWxTbsnOBdHgEMaUmyQyU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Michel","credit_id":"5353c36c0e0a265603004b40","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uwe Dallmeier","original_name":"Uwe Dallmeier","popularity":0.1576,"profile_path":"/39rD67ofqwZhUGYlJQvvfCqILTv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Gendarm Lorenzen","credit_id":"5353c37c0e0a265603004b45","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1175732,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fritz Hollenbeck","original_name":"Fritz Hollenbeck","popularity":0.2129,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5353c3940e0a26560a004a34","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":23692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tilli Breidenbach","original_name":"Tilli Breidenbach","popularity":0.0683,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mariken","credit_id":"542fee2f0e0a26464f000482","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":221324,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ulf Miehe","original_name":"Ulf Miehe","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5353c32a0e0a2655fe00496b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2140351,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Walter Fritzsche","original_name":"Walter Fritzsche","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bb40f9ac3a3687af400390e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":221324,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ulf Miehe","original_name":"Ulf Miehe","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bb40fa10e0a261a2200521e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1829561,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Theodor Storm","original_name":"Theodor Storm","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bb40fad925141781500322c","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0163023","wikidata_id":"Q1700233","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
