Vilom, a friend to both and interested in Mallika, is a passive onlooker for the first two acts. Kalidasa leaves his verdant mountain valley home for the splendour of far off Ujjain, where he wins fame. The action of the film is rooted in the village to which Kalidasa returns years later and finds Mallika married to Vilom and the mother of his child. Mallika sacrificed her love so that the poet could pursue his muse.","popularity":0.2627,"poster_path":"/7AWF3fQ8kzpSOahUOUp5hViZess.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32413,"logo_path":"/jXHqu6xyG8l5mKwK66u5ahzYdfD.png","name":"National Film Development Corporation of India","origin_country":"IN"},{"id":94464,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Finance Corporation","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Day Before the Rainy Season","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"Aashad Ka Ek Din","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"One Monsoon Day","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"Ashad Ka Ek Din","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"Ashadh Ka Ek Din","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Monsoon","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rekha Sabnis","original_name":"Rekha Sabnis","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/dwkF9K5MLE8EXmbrBLOHom5M6OV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mallika","credit_id":"534a044d0e0a2640bf000e51","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1309507,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arun Khopkar","original_name":"Arun Khopkar","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Kalidasa","credit_id":"534a04420e0a2640c2000cdb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Om Shivpuri","original_name":"Om Shivpuri","popularity":0.2333,"profile_path":"/sTfUqYGDjfNoGCXySG9PuFNsQKa.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Vilom","credit_id":"534a04560e0a2640c8000ea7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":110724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aruna Irani","original_name":"Aruna Irani","popularity":0.3072,"profile_path":"/opwljyDvJyxW6ZmC3Ao6lNCQi0r.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ambika","credit_id":"534a04380e0a2640c5000d7b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4429906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anuradha Kapoor","original_name":"Anuradha Kapoor","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"65943611ce4ddc6e647de6c1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4460793,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uma Sahaay","original_name":"Uma Sahaay","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"65943626e004a66e23179b4f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2523064,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hemant Bose","original_name":"Hemant Bose","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"6594363b6d4c9762a97261f1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4460796,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Surendra Dheer","original_name":"Surendra Dheer","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"","credit_id":"6594364551a64e020af5b2c4","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1540038,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Vishnu Mathur","original_name":"Vishnu Mathur","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"","credit_id":"65943655028f147745c6763a","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":593197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pinchoo Kapoor","original_name":"Pinchoo Kapoor","popularity":0.2319,"profile_path":"/9LmDkz3UwVIik4LAWiFCk5fo988.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"","credit_id":"659436796aa8e062d3eafbba","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171856,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mohan Rakesh","original_name":"Mohan Rakesh","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60642033ed2ac2003951cfaa","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1330334,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jaidev","original_name":"Jaidev","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6064204c4da3d4003ff5dbcd","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1046663,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"K.K.
