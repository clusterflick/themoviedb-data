His followers, led by Zabo, hijack a plane with the intent to use the passengers as hostages to trade for his release. They select a plane carrying a religious leader to use as their main hostage. They soon learn that they have an added bonus of the daughter and grandson of Colonel Shaw, a bigwig in the country. The grandson all the while has to cope with the dual problems of being hijacked and held hostage while needing a kidney transplant. The hijackers have everything in their favor, except that the colonel's daughter is the sweetheart of Major Sam Striker. Striker puts together a band of mercenaries and sets about freeing the hostages.","popularity":1.0505,"poster_path":"/zR98q8Y5KvC7BCg8VXBmdwXExv0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10671,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blue Flower Productions","origin_country":"ZA"},{"id":92345,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alpine","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"1987-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hostage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"El rehén","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Colt: Flight 802","type":"alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Zakładnik","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wings Hauser","original_name":"Wings Hauser","popularity":0.7829,"profile_path":"/yYGJCFjsWNVVOPqq2Rl1JWRrYt3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Maj.
