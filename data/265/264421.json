When they hit Earth, they have little effect on living things, but can knock out the entire power grid. Today is just another day on Earth. But in two hours, a total blackout deprives 200 million European people of power. All hospitals, airports, emergency services and communication networks fail. Europe descends into an apocalyptic Dark Age. In the midst of this unprecedented disaster, two missing kids, an escaped convict, a very pregnant woman and several others struggle to survive. They say we can survive three minutes without air, three days without water. How long can we live without power?","popularity":0.4554,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":356,"logo_path":"/9tW5wZEGotn1Ei5pErA88m47XiD.png","name":"TF1 Films
