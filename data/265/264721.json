The trial is given the full formal treatment it might receive in a civilian setting. The key point in this film is that these are the actual murderers admitting their actual crimes before a judges' panel consisting of their peers: actual prisoners at the same institution. Having no force of law, the trial proceeds without reaching a conclusion. That is something the viewer is asked to provide. This movie won a Silver Bear from the 1974 Berlin Film Festival.","popularity":0.1188,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":128,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Name of the People","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1752132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerd Siekmann","original_name":"Gerd Siekmann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Richter","credit_id":"58989fd19251417a9100afa3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1752133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinz-Dietrich Stark","original_name":"Heinz-Dietrich Stark","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Anstaltsleiter","credit_id":"58989fdb9251417a8500a787","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1752134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hajo Wandschneider","original_name":"Hajo Wandschneider","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Rechtsanwalt","credit_id":"58989fe6c3a368770400a46b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":221381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ottokar Runze","original_name":"Ottokar Runze","popularity":0.0993,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"589792f09251412e0d01d45a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":221381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ottokar Runze","original_name":"Ottokar Runze","popularity":0.0993,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58989fa792514145820048a7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":221381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ottokar Runze","original_name":"Ottokar Runze","popularity":0.0993,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58989fad9251417a9100af7e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1944473,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michael Epp","original_name":"Michael Epp","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f142f022afb250034417d70","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1752131,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Paul Ellmerer","original_name":"Paul Ellmerer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f142f0c4083b3003605f849","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0163003","wikidata_id":"Q6012660","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1974-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
