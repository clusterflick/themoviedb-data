Schiller is disgusted by the everyday routine of the military, always back and forth between breeding and drills. Conversation, conflict or even critique are discouraged – the oppression insufferable for the young rebel. Disgusted by the brutality, he writes his drama \"The Bandit\", which he would later publish anonymously. But following a frank conversation with the Duke, Schiller is dishonored and must leave the land.","popularity":0.4653,"poster_path":"/5TrbWzpugamcMgeFPupSmRoj89u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7448,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tobis
