She was an immigrant who, in her own way, tried to break the molds established by her upper-class upbringing. Her sensitivity and intellectual development made her question matters of social injustice, educational and gender inequalities, the importance of socially-committed art forms and the vindication of democracy throughout Latin America. Her tragic end reveals much about the history of Guatemala.","popularity":0.1573,"poster_path":"/bRmMVPBcOAWkkHfv0jqeYvV49Ru.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2014-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alaide Foppa Falla, The Unfortunate One","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arturo Taracena","original_name":"Arturo Taracena","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"534b56f0c3a3682df6002449","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marta Lamas","original_name":"Marta Lamas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"534b579bc3a3682e0700237d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Silvia Solórzano","original_name":"Silvia Solórzano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"534b57a9c3a3682ded00234f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Solórzano","original_name":"Laura Solórzano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"534b583bc3a3682dfe002321","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1110532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elena Poniatowska","original_name":"Elena Poniatowska","popularity":0.1282,"profile_path":"/zbn8pvq5IngFToZOFyY6wezs9yX.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"534b584ec3a3682ded002368","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julio Solórzano Foppa","original_name":"Julio Solórzano Foppa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"534b585cc3a3682dd8002400","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eli Bartra","original_name":"Eli Bartra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"534b586fc3a3682ddf0022c9","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"María del Carmen de Lara","original_name":"María del Carmen de Lara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"534b55bbc3a3682e07002353","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leopoldo Best","original_name":"Leopoldo Best","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"534b5662c3a3682dd1002280","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"María del Carmen de Lara","original_name":"María del Carmen de Lara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f8e92b1bc639566ad9fe1b","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5364306,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Antonio Uruñuela","original_name":"Antonio Uruñuela","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f8e9631bc639566ad9fe36","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leopoldo Best","original_name":"Leopoldo Best","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f8e973a04f530b5c991aee","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5364307,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rony Hernández","original_name":"Rony Hernández","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f8e9a71bc639566ad9fe47","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5364308,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Itzam Zapata","original_name":"Itzam Zapata","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f8e9d0ea80d85175999eb2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pMf2G0bf2rdmTgGEVuriVJSCYlH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1170,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bRmMVPBcOAWkkHfv0jqeYvV49Ru.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":780}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
