This peaceful atmosphere is shattered by Operation Overlord, minutely described in the second part of the documentary. The landing on D-Day and the ensuing battles and bombings martyr the peaceful area giving the earth thousands of body instead of seeds. In the last part, the dreadful aftermath of the steel storm is shown both with sympathy for the victims and hope for the future, since all these sacrifices, whether military or civilians, have not been in vain.","popularity":0.0843,"poster_path":"/4A0Z8I6zHTNcf1VQqZUjueU1rlw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1947-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sixth of June at Dawn","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238377,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Grémillon","original_name":"Jean Grémillon","popularity":0.1448,"profile_path":"/y8MjDr9wY5mMH4HWzIEhSJuM7Qp.jpg","credit_id":"5347eb78c3a36866fd001388","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238377,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Grémillon","original_name":"Jean Grémillon","popularity":0.1448,"profile_path":"/y8MjDr9wY5mMH4HWzIEhSJuM7Qp.jpg","credit_id":"5347eb9dc3a36866fd00138d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":960039,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Roger Desormière","original_name":"Roger Desormière","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/rY4s6AO4RP2uYkEiihy2uhivxSv.jpg","credit_id":"659cdc6cb6cff100f0d9faf6","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":546805,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Louis Page","original_name":"Louis Page","popularity":0.0907,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"588117e3c3a3681449001371","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0121970","wikidata_id":"Q3220171","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/4A0Z8I6zHTNcf1VQqZUjueU1rlw.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"World Festival of Film and Fine Arts","release_date":"1947-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"a corporate screening in Paris","release_date":"1946-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Salle Pleyel in Paris","release_date":"1946-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"at the Majestic Cinema in Caen","release_date":"1946-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Carentan","release_date":"1947-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Scala Theater in London","release_date":"1947-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
