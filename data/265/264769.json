Sheila Gaines is a former child star whose first husband is unwilling to give her a divorce. A chance meeting with Margo Anthony on a train leads to a conversation where the mentally unstable Margo, who hates her mother, suggests that they swap murders, so as to solve their problems. Although she thinks nothing of the conversation, Sheila's life takes a surprising turn when her husband is murdered by Margo. Now Margo wants Sheila to do her part of \"the deal.\" With the police on her tail and Margo constantly in her face, Sheila must find a way out of this tangled web.","popularity":2.3471,"poster_path":"/uZwa0Ye52VwUmgSS45H9k2uMAL9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1957,"logo_path":"/qIxtba5CbnJfHCA88czLfTNKW9M.png","name":"Warner Bros.
