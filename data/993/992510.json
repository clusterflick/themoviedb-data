Considering the artists’ far-flung locations it was decided that the gallery’s locale should provide them with a ‘temporary heimat’.  The Mindelsee lake situated just a few hundred yards away from the gallery became the natural focus of the installation. During their stay, Sabine and Rutger recorded the video and audio footage that became the foundation which Steve Roden responded to with material inspired by his surroundings in the US. It resulted in an immersive four-channel audio-visual presentation, in a gallery space also showing additional visual works by each of the artists, and the floor covered with dried leaves.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/x2DjMoYF0Dxsnwnjime0IacmFFO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2010-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lichtung","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2599519,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Steve Roden","original_name":"Steve Roden","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b8731667203d0d390a431d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1980814,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rutger Zuydervelt","original_name":"Rutger Zuydervelt","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b87322bc86570452d2e4f3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3602923,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sabine Bürger","original_name":"Sabine Bürger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b8730067203d0d3888b0f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x2DjMoYF0Dxsnwnjime0IacmFFO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Galerie Vayhinger","release_date":"2010-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD Release","release_date":"2010-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
