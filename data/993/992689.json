The irony is that the record itself is not that exciting--just carrying your lunch pail to work every day--and barring some bizarre weather event or freak injury, everyone knew it was going to happen at Camden Yards on September 6, 1996, and the game unfolded pretty normally, other than guests such as Earl Weaver arriving in the broadcast booth to ramble about Ripken. But as soon as the game became official and Ripken grew tired of basking in the applause, he took an impromptu victory lap around the stadium slapping hands with the fans, and the ESPN broadcast crew had the rare insight to stay silent and let the moment speak for itself.","popularity":0.685,"poster_path":"/qraHzMTnPLl0KbRusgeLaDqJjG0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11709,"logo_path":"/aJ2Y9GJNyxWWfMfOsaVXHXCHaDM.png","name":"Major League Baseball Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Baltimore Orioles Legends - Cal Ripken Jr. The Iron Man's Legendary Career","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":974616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cal Ripken Jr.","original_name":"Cal Ripken Jr.","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":"/pCee5zxhXJB4jlThg5GSYyKG9Rl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66b438cc491f6a7554888242","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Norton","original_name":"Edward Norton","popularity":3.2243,"profile_path":"/8nytsqL59SFJTVYVrN72k6qkGgJ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66b439f2d1d9c3d8556a4d59","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1249008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Earl Weaver","original_name":"Earl Weaver","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66b43a6a2c08c1b6f1364594","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1WcvKJolL5SxH5MRUEnFx0SQj4S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.739,"height":2382,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qraHzMTnPLl0KbRusgeLaDqJjG0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1760}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
