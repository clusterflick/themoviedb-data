Starring Phillip Mullings Jr. (Netflix's First Kill, American Soul), and Mayumi Roller (Team USA Olympian London 2012), and from Canadian filmmaker and video game developer Edward Douglas (Mass Effect 2, Eon Altar, Need for Speed), U•Run is a sci-fi thriller that interrogates the ethics of technology, where metaverse-style AI algorithms are able to manipulate emotions and drive addictions to achieve their corporate goals.  All Jody wants is a healthy distraction from a bad breakup, but in a near future where augmented-reality assistants mine our personal data to cater to our every whim, she begins to fall for her charming AI running trainer.
