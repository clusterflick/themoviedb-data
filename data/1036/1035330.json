Blue is the liminal space where the motion traverses the static, painting meets cinema, and dynamic tension liberates dreams. Blue, in the film, is not a statement nor a colour, but rather the emergence of a feeling. An empty canvas for the viewer to engage within the contraction and expansion of the light flux.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Azul no Azul","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3134987,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gianmarco Donaggio","original_name":"Gianmarco Donaggio","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63494488e263bb0084f25def","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21407622","wikidata_id":"Q115629832","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
