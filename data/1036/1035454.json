The images - rendered from collections containing over 50,000 specimens - were take by microscopists over three years to create the animated shorts Nanoscapes and Biopixels. Both the animation and the score play with concepts of pattern, time, density and other means of development common to biological evolution.","popularity":0.1987,"poster_path":"/qAMyozo5FNsShmMwJTB1nwUYWdG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"biopixels","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3740337,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristina Dutton","original_name":"Kristina Dutton","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6349a0ae688cd0007c3895e6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3740337,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristina Dutton","original_name":"Kristina Dutton","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6349a0c6e22d28007c011332","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3518124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arnaud Martin","original_name":"Arnaud Martin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6349a0ecb7abb5007ed4de64","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qAMyozo5FNsShmMwJTB1nwUYWdG.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":227610,"name":"microscopic"},{"id":258047,"name":"butterflies"},{"id":258541,"name":"biodiversity"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
