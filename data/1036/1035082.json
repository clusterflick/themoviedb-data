We see local residents, some homeless; junkyards and empty lots; the facade of a bar. Footage from a medical training film and images from an exercise video, filmed off TV, are intercut. The sound track is a similarly dense collage of music fragments and spoken texts from various sources. The film is divided into seven numbered and titled sections.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poverties","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurie Dunphy","original_name":"Laurie Dunphy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63486814a14bef009cba6f47","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
