In this highly personal film diary, filmmaker Frédéric Guillaume allows us to share in the joy and love of a young family, and the heartrending breakup that follows, all viewed entirely from his own perspective. He records his happiness as he sees his daughter grow, and his pain when he realizes that he and his beloved are growing apart. We see the efforts he makes to preserve their happiness, but he has no choice but to readjust his hopes. He used to dream about all kinds of things, especially about dark-haired women, but he never dreamed that he would be a stay-at-home dad. He would prefer to have remained a child.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Almost like in my dreams","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":578539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frédéric Guillaume","original_name":"Frédéric Guillaume","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634b1b21e263bb007c284e69","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6651666","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
