Jeongjo Moon, who was not welcomed anywhere in North and South Korea during his lifetime and did not step on the lands of both countries until the end. About 1,700 cultural assets containing the dreams of his life were reborn as the Goryeo Museum in Kyoto and are there with a will to return them to the unified country. A period of liberation, division, and ideology.
