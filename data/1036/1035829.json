After two years, I found a former farmhouse and started renovating it. In the centers of the surrounding villages, enamel signs from socialist times were attached to walls and pedestals: “Death March April 1945” - with a red concentration camp triangle, a simple map with the route and a slightly abstract row of shaven-headed prisoners. Sometimes flowers were planted in front of them.","popularity":0.1449,"poster_path":"/xsEAFaWiH4ZcNQtE1EjXn9dODIJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":184238,"logo_path":null,"name":"Martin Gressmann
