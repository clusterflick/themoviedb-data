He knew this peace wouldnâ€™t last, as an established rule granted him only three years before he would be hunted down. Surely enough, in the present day, Ares is visited by his brother and sister; who hold him captive in his own apartment and deliver a warning that he will soon be captured and tortured to a greater extent. His sister Maura offers him a chance to escape, but Ares decides to stay and wait for his punishment in order to protect Bennet.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/2fJrb3TKDvPawyE3HSKrLn7pV2M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What are you running from?","title":"Periculum","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3742035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Brian","original_name":"Christopher Brian","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/5TkePCckwVuCO0lm3LMxApo7UxC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"634aea2c1b1f3c0081aa00e9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3742038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tali de Assis","original_name":"Tali de Assis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"634aea3e501cf2007a1f0a3f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3742037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hassan Farrow","original_name":"Hassan Farrow","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"634aea3af1759c00827c1191","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2230806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Menendez","original_name":"Matthew Menendez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"634aea71d55c3d0090b338c3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3041081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justin C.
