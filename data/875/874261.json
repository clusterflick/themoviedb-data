Due to political changes, her husband is arrested, and she has to run for her life, finding herself in a refugee shelter in south Tel Aviv, where nobody cares who she was. Even there, at the skirts of town, among the desperation and poverty, she does not give up and struggles with all her might to regain her former status. A torrid love affair with an affluent Israeli architect brings her closer to her target until she discovers that he will never leave his family, and that her fate is doomed.","popularity":0.326,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ambassador's Wife","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1321912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ester Rada","original_name":"Ester Rada","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Yerusalem","credit_id":"6140de1560c7510042ef1a91","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3108394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ornella Bess","original_name":"Ornella Bess","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/k28v3kbPX5mK7kGzAhctKj3V4Gt.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Marie","credit_id":"6140de26aaf89700421a6fda","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3234801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shai Fredo","original_name":"Shai Fredo","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"6140de2f0cd32a0043e92d41","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3234802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Osher Gibli","original_name":"Osher Gibli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"6140de3d149565002d3a96e9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":147420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yehezkel Lazarov","original_name":"Yehezkel Lazarov","popularity":0.1506,"profile_path":"/qK8NKvLUUQtZrYIyXwaGp6x3Yzl.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"6140de575e12000063c22680","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":51088,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aviv Aldema","original_name":"Aviv Aldema","popularity":0.0941,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6140ddd294d8a80027a450f8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1157325,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dina Zvi-Riklis","original_name":"Dina Zvi-Riklis","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6140dd7f594c940043aa9258","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3234799,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ori Lee-Tal","original_name":"Ori Lee-Tal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6140ddb89979d2004637c66f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eran Riklis","original_name":"Eran Riklis","popularity":0.1148,"profile_path":"/1pCAzdpi1oGUF5tgaHNrIwBPZm5.jpg","credit_id":"6140dd9c9979d2009050f296","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2299029,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ronen Geva","original_name":"Ronen Geva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6140dde3aaf89700421a6f11","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2352994,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gidi Avivi","original_name":"Gidi Avivi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6140dd8f60c751002af4ec80","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1329211,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ziv Berkovich","original_name":"Ziv Berkovich","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6140ddc6aaf8970062be4330","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1163360,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alma Ganihar","original_name":"Alma Ganihar","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6140dda79979d2009050f29a","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3234800,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yonatan Riklis","original_name":"Yonatan Riklis","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6140ddef006b01002d82c29d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5189854","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":972,"name":"refugee"},{"id":178097,"name":"migrant worker"},{"id":225359,"name":"eritrea"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
