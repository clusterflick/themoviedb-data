He loves films and finances his visits to the cinema by selling lost properties from cinema visits in the refugee camp. One day he meets Anna and her friend Ida. At a dinner together in the shared flat of the two, they find out that they all share a love of music. Anna and Ida can sing great together and Hum shares the contact with his friends who play in a band. A timid and touching love story develops between Hum and Anna. Both are looking forward to the first performance of the band, in which Anna now sings. But shortly before the performance, Hum is to be deported. Neither his love for Anna and music nor his imagination can save him from the everyday life of a refugee.","popularity":0.585,"poster_path":"/jGsFkkLEDBNLwjmYQCDho3bWabS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Cinema and film, music and dance, people and compassion: a love story.","title":"What It All Could Be","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3235411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pourya Pour","original_name":"Pourya Pour","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/v9oGs1tv8NG3fvv8OkATX5cDK49.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hum...","credit_id":"6141cf06006b010044771f06","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3235412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Solomia Kushnir","original_name":"Solomia Kushnir","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Anna","credit_id":"6141cf174f33ad008dcafb36","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1562608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nika Kushnir","original_name":"Nika Kushnir","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ida","credit_id":"6141cf2894d8a80027a600c7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3235413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anis Hamdoun","original_name":"Anis Hamdoun","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Hamid","credit_id":"6141cf3b56b9f70028844f4c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3235414,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moped Ascona","original_name":"Moped Ascona","popularity":0.056,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Moped Ascona (Band)","credit_id":"6141cf6894d8a80027a600e7","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3235411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pourya Pour","original_name":"Pourya Pour","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/v9oGs1tv8NG3fvv8OkATX5cDK49.jpg","credit_id":"6141cf9956b9f7008b9c4c53","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3235411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pourya Pour","original_name":"Pourya Pour","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/v9oGs1tv8NG3fvv8OkATX5cDK49.jpg","credit_id":"6141cfa85e120000422efc6d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3235411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pourya Pour","original_name":"Pourya Pour","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/v9oGs1tv8NG3fvv8OkATX5cDK49.jpg","credit_id":"6141cfcd1495650064570119","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3235411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pourya Pour","original_name":"Pourya Pour","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/v9oGs1tv8NG3fvv8OkATX5cDK49.jpg","credit_id":"6141cfdf85c0a20061b4cd3d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3167504,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jens Dittmar","original_name":"Jens Dittmar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6141cff885c0a20061b4cd45","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1963158,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Erik Zühlsdorf","original_name":"Erik Zühlsdorf","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6141d00885c0a2008972be3f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3235415,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nara Lee","original_name":"Nara Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6141d047149565002d3c2f3d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15405416","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1061,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jGsFkkLEDBNLwjmYQCDho3bWabS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1691,"name":"dance"},{"id":972,"name":"refugee"},{"id":496,"name":"poetry"},{"id":9673,"name":"love"},{"id":18454,"name":"compassion"},{"id":172514,"name":"homage"},{"id":283297,"name":"music"},{"id":285028,"name":"story"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Was Alles Sein Könnte (2020) Trailer Deutsch","key":"ODPFdoGgyy4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-08-30T08:40:46.000Z","id":"6141d1c0006b010063efa7c9"}]}}}
