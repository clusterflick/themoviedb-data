In 1997, a huge fire burned Tick Hall to the ground, leaving only the blackened chimney standing. The loss was a blow to the community and Tick Hall’s owners – talk-show host Dick Cavett and actress Carrie Nye – who lived there for 30 years. Because of its historic and artistic importance, they embarked upon an ambitious three-year project – rebuilding Tick Hall exactly as it was.","popularity":0.3247,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From the Ashes: The Life and Times of Tick Hall","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Cavett","original_name":"Dick Cavett","popularity":0.4865,"profile_path":"/7g5J47vQY2k4GzGhlJr6KdYm04P.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"614073085e120000422cfb87","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":175087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carrie Nye","original_name":"Carrie Nye","popularity":0.1193,"profile_path":"/rNld8MZJoO0jrGWoDZfiht3lQFX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6140730f006b010063ed8164","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1653117,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Scott Morris","original_name":"Scott Morris","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614deb92e1faed002d1fa67d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
