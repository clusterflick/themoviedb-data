A young, gay man with no money, no job and no knowledge of English, but a strong will. A will to built a new life in a completely different world, in which he hopes to feel free and more comfortable with his sexual orientation. On a warm spring day in May 1992 he dies in his New Yorker apartment from his struggle with AIDS . The only thing that’s left: videos, letters, photos and a few clothes. Plus, the most important thing: memories and stories of his family, friends and his former partner. Can love between partners, between a person and his family be strong enough to last longer than death? What does really stay after a person's gone? Told from a personal point of view, the film takes its audience on a journey to follow Horst's footsteps.","popularity":0.0683,"poster_path":"/jVcG2sNLMpwhBGqd2RarWBxOS6J.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93139,"logo_path":"/jnKNXs1t9svg8VhAar2f8hadXWX.png","name":"Fachhochschule Dortmund","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Every Memory Is Precious.","title":"Horst","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3234988,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa Bühl","original_name":"Lisa Bühl","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/kbldqzICMMFJw97I3m7Il70UwIU.jpg","credit_id":"614110d9d236e6006725fcf4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5234093,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ana Maria Pulido","original_name":"Ana Maria Pulido","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67be4357c3f8c5a804efa508","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7720786","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5EpHcTIw8pGnGSCUPy35bOphYrF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jVcG2sNLMpwhBGqd2RarWBxOS6J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
