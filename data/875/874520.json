The film invites us to follow a voice whose thoughts and doubts about the present become a meditation accompanied by works of art. The film features all the artworks exhibited at the second Riga Biennial of Contemporary Art (RIBOCA2). Reminiscent of a Tarkovskyan dystopia, the united ecosystem of living nature, a disused power plant, an abandoned paintball field, warehouses, flocks of birds, cruise ships and railway tracks, makes the film’s space its own metaphor for the collapse of Soviet ideals and capitalist hopes.","popularity":0.0755,"poster_path":"/ftDHZAOoYVFoepTXObgNIU9ZVvM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2021-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"and suddenly it all blossoms","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3235431,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rebecca Lamarche-Vadel","original_name":"Rebecca Lamarche-Vadel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6141da2c56b9f700638077d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1198979,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dāvis Sīmanis Jr.","original_name":"Dāvis Sīmanis Jr.","popularity":0.0757,"profile_path":"/vCI5DEfnqqb9RtyVJUPBnEfJ53Q.jpg","credit_id":"6141d9fd5e12000020ac770b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3235431,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rebecca Lamarche-Vadel","original_name":"Rebecca Lamarche-Vadel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615e0ea5c8a2d4008c7e27c4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1699652,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ernests Ansons","original_name":"Ernests Ansons","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615e0e246beaea0042a34ab3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1566705,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrejs Rudzāts","original_name":"Andrejs Rudzāts","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615e0e3b66a7c30042376a2b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1214,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ftDHZAOoYVFoepTXObgNIU9ZVvM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":810}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Art Basel Film Program","release_date":"2021-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Riga IFF","release_date":"2021-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"The Art Newspaper Russia Film Festival","release_date":"2021-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"and suddenly it all blossoms trailer","key":"54vEs4cDnME","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-09-09T08:08:02.000Z","id":"61660ffe23851300614e1533"}]}}}
