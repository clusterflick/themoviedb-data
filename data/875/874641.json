During the months he laid immobilized in hospital, the notion of ever getting back on his bike seemed so remote he barely gave it any real thought. But ten years later, with the help of friends and family, Alex is on the verge of finding his way back onto two wheels.  257 Down is a documentary film about patience, endurance and courage. It is a story that will inspire people of all abilities to follow their dreams, no matter how inaccessible they might seem.","popularity":0.0516,"poster_path":"/A8rxnEKvuJdQLWe0PUHtGBY4HL5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160999,"logo_path":null,"name":"Porteous Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2020-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"257 Down","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3235869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Abbott","original_name":"Alex Abbott","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"614259b00cd32a0043ebbbd1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3235866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Porteous","original_name":"David Porteous","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6142599c85c0a2008973c474","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3235866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Porteous","original_name":"David Porteous","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61425992d236e60026379b7f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13094302","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2126,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A8rxnEKvuJdQLWe0PUHtGBY4HL5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1417}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"257 Down | TMFF 2021 Trailer","key":"xhle5nKQpkw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-08-17T14:00:20.000Z","id":"614259f356b9f70028855161"}]}}}
