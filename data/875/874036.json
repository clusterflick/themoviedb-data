How is it possible to run a top restaurant like this at the end of the world? Prior to covid-19, people took immense detours to dine at this eatery serving food sourced from just 500 square miles of produce, in a rugged terrain and where the climate is subpolar, windy, wet, cloudy, and cold, with average temperatures close to freezing throughout the year, everlasting light in summer and a scorching darkness all through winter. In Nordic by Nature we dive into the poetic mind of young Faroese chef Poul Andrias Ziska, and seek to find the traditions, history and distinctive ancient practices that lie beneath the world's most remote fine dining experience.","popularity":0.0597,"poster_path":"/8M8POrZZoN9GkTIWkeWhEeLQRe6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2021-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nordic by Nature - Michelin Stars","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Michelin Stars II – Nordic By Nature","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1342732,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rasmus Dinesen","original_name":"Rasmus Dinesen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/lLA93Sk88dbqBktU9LorgCvNdf9.jpg","credit_id":"614073c29979d20046372283","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15509450","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6WGefSDJl2pVREO6Oguj8bJKz0P.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2560},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hM9TF51404aYgltDTR9gWWpyjuW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8M8POrZZoN9GkTIWkeWhEeLQRe6.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":2124,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5DplmGwQTu7OceWiWYLIRYgljtj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Scandinavian Film Festival","release_date":"2022-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"San Sebastián Film Festival","release_date":"2021-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Seoul International Eco Film Festival","release_date":"2024-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Michelin Stars II Nordic by Nature Trailer","key":"wcpuH-HbP6g","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-01-26T00:06:42.000Z","id":"62b92fe6bc86570452d341f3"}]}}}
