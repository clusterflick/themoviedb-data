In July 2011 it will be ten years since the closure of elBulli, the restaurant that forever changed the face of world gastronomy. The time has come to follow the footprints left by Ferran and his team, footprints which remain alive today. For many it will be a revelation to realise just how many aspects of today’s foodie culture stem from a house hidden away in a remote cove in the province of Girona.","popularity":0.1489,"poster_path":"/kzcdfOngDWx3uDTkjg6dzwi1jVU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2021-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Legacy of elBulli","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":132448,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ferran Adrià","original_name":"Ferran Adrià","popularity":0.0937,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6419a6286a2227007d745477","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Adrià","original_name":"Albert Adrià","popularity":0.1563,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6419a6ade74146007c8373c9","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2600203,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José Larraza","original_name":"José Larraza","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6140748856b9f7008b9a1c5e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3234206,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iñigo Ruiz Aquerreta","original_name":"Iñigo Ruiz Aquerreta","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614074809c97bd0064d5a27f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16377872","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/hP9IoPl2uxiPztMfy7CjxaMJEH4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kzcdfOngDWx3uDTkjg6dzwi1jVU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
