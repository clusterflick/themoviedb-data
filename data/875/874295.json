The seasons dominate tourism, the dominant modern sector as it is the most popular domestic destination, with walks, aquatic fun and lake tours, as well as traditional rural life, including old-fashioned games and competitions at Rusland. While the varied environment is home to many wildlife species, some rare or even unique, the agricultural pride is the local Herdwick sheep, which produces fine wool and survives outdoors on high slopes even in harsh winters.","popularity":0.345,"poster_path":"/x8zfaxgCwtJQG37pgHHFcbb19gM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United
