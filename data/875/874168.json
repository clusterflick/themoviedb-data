Her intervention in the Lighthouse on San Sebastian's Santa Clara Island. Taking her inspiration from the island's wild nature and the peculiar geology of the Basque coast, the sculpture by Cristina Iglesias transforms the interior of the lighthouse, now restored and converted into a vertiginous sculptural space. The cast-metal geological strata and the water flowing to the rhythm of the waves and the tides will offer the visitor a profound experience. This film looks at the process of building the work.","popularity":0.1673,"poster_path":"/gDhLaWJJCkwVjnYI85DAR2aQuS4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65398,"logo_path":"/jW6iQpVx8nyfHmKktTs9SfhbLft.png","name":"Txintxua Films","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2021-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hondalea: Marine Abyss","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Hondalea","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2685293,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cristina Iglesias","original_name":"Cristina Iglesias","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/7jolE8GJmFkCgwHPWAP4pqUk30E.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"6142e6f6048638004327f28a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1034477,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Asier Altuna","original_name":"Asier Altuna","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/8904hiBejz1Od8bqIajHma9xDiE.jpg","credit_id":"6140ace356b9f7008b9a581d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1034477,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Asier Altuna","original_name":"Asier Altuna","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/8904hiBejz1Od8bqIajHma9xDiE.jpg","credit_id":"6142e3d49450fe008ecba8d5","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1678147,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marian Fernández Pascal","original_name":"Marian Fernández Pascal","popularity":0.0594,"profile_path":"/6gjM7SWvzHGutf5OD7OkCfJriC1.jpg","credit_id":"6142e3e75e12000020aed235","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1585446,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Laurent Dufreche","original_name":"Laurent Dufreche","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6142e3f585da12004378e9f3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2496989,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aitor Etxebarria","original_name":"Aitor Etxebarria","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/zw7WSgLZJGnm6RK9HgVZMgn9HM1.jpg","credit_id":"6142e401ec4552007ff15d16","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1530149,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alazne Ameztoy","original_name":"Alazne Ameztoy","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6142e40c5e12000042311f81","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1550263,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Xanti Salvador","original_name":"Xanti Salvador","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6142e414048638004327ef17","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1034477,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Asier Altuna","original_name":"Asier Altuna","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/8904hiBejz1Od8bqIajHma9xDiE.jpg","credit_id":"6142e42094d8a80027a85dc3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1629318,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Javier Agirre Erauso","original_name":"Javier Agirre Erauso","popularity":0.0518,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6142e4280cd32a008d877dd8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2877481,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Txarli Argiñano","original_name":"Txarli Argiñano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6142e434f74f5f0060e9e4d8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3236307,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mattin Saldias","original_name":"Mattin Saldias","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6142e4405e12000020aed278","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3236308,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jon Iglesias","original_name":"Jon Iglesias","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6142e44d9f0e19006475aecc","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15467956","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aMGfTppIAizTyDpzzau6PStOPYl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1671,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gDhLaWJJCkwVjnYI85DAR2aQuS4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1114}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"69th San Sebastian International Film Festival","release_date":"2021-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
