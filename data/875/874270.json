There, she embarks on a search for her roots as well as a sense of justice.  The journey from Israel to Ukraine encompasses meetings with current residents of Lviv, family reunions, and personal reflections. All of these elements converge as the film maps the effects of the past—and all of its painful memories—on the present.","popularity":0.1121,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":160686,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vice Versa Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chicken Soup With Knives","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3234822,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leora Eisenstein","original_name":"Leora Eisenstein","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6140e3e69450fe00430ef84f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3234823,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Oded Kimhi","original_name":"Oded Kimhi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6140e4211495650064558f16","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":42420,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Itai Elohev","original_name":"Itai Elohev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6140e43d0cd32a0062bd69aa","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2352994,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gidi Avivi","original_name":"Gidi Avivi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6140e4089979d2009050ffbd","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3234836,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Arie Ben Weiss","original_name":"Arie Ben Weiss","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6140e479594c94002a7f81af","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2352994,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gidi Avivi","original_name":"Gidi Avivi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6140e3f2d236e600433bb69e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3225757,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ido Bahat","original_name":"Ido Bahat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6140e417594c94002a7f8111","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3234832,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Amir Tam","original_name":"Amir Tam","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6140e4661495650043ff849f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3234822,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leora Eisenstein","original_name":"Leora Eisenstein","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6140e3fe594c94008ba5266d","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3234827,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Idan Shemesh","original_name":"Idan Shemesh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6140e45094d8a80067dd26bb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3234837,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yehuda Poliker","original_name":"Yehuda Poliker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6140e48e56b9f70045fd53c5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":51088,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aviv Aldema","original_name":"Aviv Aldema","popularity":0.0941,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6140e42d048638008c431baa","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1739,"name":"holocaust (shoah)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
