The visit was politically significant - Sierra Leona had become independent from Britain in April the same year. Colonialism’s influence is felt throughout the film, and not just in the place names (Victoria Park, Queen Elizabeth II Quay) - the ‘day in the life of a Bo schoolboy’ seems not radically different from the British equivalent, while the ‘children’s rally’ consists of boys dressed impractically in boaters and blazers, and girls marching in gymslips.","popularity":0.1144,"poster_path":"/sY8lq5OZg3Q5hrCUalBUFgoD2bU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7281,"logo_path":"/iI7qdR1OFPo0U41BlpKBLD3xesh.png","name":"BFI","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":8598,"logo_path":"/pFhDa84YifM8WUjeoBw3hkl2fRC.png","name":"COI","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":124028,"logo_path":null,"name":"British Pathé","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1962-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sierra Leone Greets the Queen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":558240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom","original_name":"Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom","popularity":0.4598,"profile_path":"/rO3H0ndtekEtNzRScYQMREiB3gI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65007b70efea7a00fd1b779b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4267556,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milton Margai","original_name":"Milton Margai","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65007b92ffc9de0ee3c5eb4b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1164486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh","original_name":"Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh","popularity":0.1193,"profile_path":"/uPfQY4f2uJP6TJVg7BdLzp0lzce.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65007bfc1bf266011c782cf6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4267562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Elliott","original_name":"George Elliott","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Commentary (voice)","credit_id":"65007c55d7dcd200c536ace1","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4267560,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"T.
