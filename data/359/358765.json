Literature and cinema have strived to question and bear witness to the enormous trauma of this period called the “black decade”.","popularity":0.5086,"poster_path":"/9YQYkg929Y6eq2DSUDJlZkCGVtH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2015-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Let Them Come","video":false,"vote_average":9.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Let Them Come","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1751082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amazigh Kateb","original_name":"Amazigh Kateb","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/gWKqcPSgGUM9z46TNrQ7m26WwsI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Nouredine","credit_id":"5897438b9251412e14018a05","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":56241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachida Brakni","original_name":"Rachida Brakni","popularity":0.2833,"profile_path":"/bsPgWJjtKcXI7IZH2ro0A7BlJfA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Yasmina","credit_id":"589743a792514129c801517f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3704169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Farida Saboundji","original_name":"Farida Saboundji","popularity":0.1464,"profile_path":"/laNe8hOpAXvXgoQODqcH83Mxgx8.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"The Mother","credit_id":"6325f2d36bdec30091d1be17","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4494765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abdelmadjid Meskoud","original_name":"Abdelmadjid Meskoud","popularity":0.095,"profile_path":"/4jRjPPgbUaphAtT6Hy2e30toNE1.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Old Man Hotel Dar Mohand","credit_id":"65b575deb6cff10149f6212f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1751085,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arezki Mellal","original_name":"Arezki Mellal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"589743e4925141294a0159bf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1751086,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Léonidas Arvanitis","original_name":"Léonidas Arvanitis","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5897441ac3a36808a5018f54","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1273514,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Yorgos Lamprinos","original_name":"Yorgos Lamprinos","popularity":0.1564,"profile_path":"/hSoRxA16aG4Y4273sbbDAhpQsLK.jpg","credit_id":"589744399251415aaa014714","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1050961,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Salem Brahimi","original_name":"Salem Brahimi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec12f226d675a001f7d9dcc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1050961,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Salem Brahimi","original_name":"Salem Brahimi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec12f2d3d3557001ee58b91","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4520338","wikidata_id":"Q20899486","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1922,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9YQYkg929Y6eq2DSUDJlZkCGVtH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":13015,"name":"terrorism"},{"id":169449,"name":"algeria"},{"id":189126,"name":"north africa"},{"id":210608,"name":"1990s"},{"id":239927,"name":"islamism"},{"id":293245,"name":"maghreb"},{"id":293547,"name":"djazair"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
