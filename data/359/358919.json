President Anwar Sadat led the country down the diametrically opposite path. He forged an alliance with the Muslim Brotherhood, the regime’s life-long enemy, and rerouted the country onto the road of capitalism. By ignoring increasing wealth gaps and insisting on peace with Israel at all political costs, the “pious” president opened up the Pandora’s Box of radical Islam, a decision that cost him his life, and which has since had repercussions on the entire world.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/fMjeMYleVpNFmYbCyE0nG2w9USd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2015-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Egypt's Modern Pharaohs: Nasser","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1177821,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jihan El-Tahri","original_name":"Jihan El-Tahri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55ef8e339251413e3e01cb7f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4937134","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.66,"height":1023,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fMjeMYleVpNFmYbCyE0nG2w9USd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
