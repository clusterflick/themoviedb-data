Duggan was pulled over early one morning, and minutes later, was shot dead. This event ignited the now-infamous Tottenham riots and made headlines around the globe, but, as so often happens, the issue soon dropped from the news. Picking up the story where the media left off, we're brought back to its roots in Duggan's neighbourhood, following his friends' fight for justice and search for meaning, while struggling against ongoing discrimination in their daily lives.","popularity":0.2443,"poster_path":"/7MnXcajw8koiZWsQTlsllzMnXd2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116985,"logo_path":null,"name":"G.A.
