She played Helen Wyatt, whose father (the rotund Guy Kibbee) loses his ranch to the hayseed singing group the Hoosier Hot Shots. Unbeknownst to Wyatt, the Hot Shots have been swindled by a couple of Eastern crooks (Ian Keith and Matt Willis) and consider themselves the lawful owners. Chased by the irascible Wyatt, the band members seek protection from aspiring singer Curt Stanton (Curtis), who they mistake for a gunslinger.","popularity":0.8542,"poster_path":"/gxg36jlYgHDCnf3Pp036zR9a17y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1946-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A WALLOP-ALOOZA OF AN ACTION MUSICAL!","title":"Singing on the Trail","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Curtis","original_name":"Ken Curtis","popularity":1.3421,"profile_path":"/nL4aCX6RJuuw1ML3FGWELXNiCdD.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Curt Stanton","credit_id":"55edab58c3a368090c005305","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Donnell","original_name":"Jeff Donnell","popularity":0.3883,"profile_path":"/x7qNasj4LB4h6RCknz0PiTBZI9r.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Cindy Brown","credit_id":"55edab61c3a3682c62015a1a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy Kibbee","original_name":"Guy Kibbee","popularity":0.2157,"profile_path":"/dYPlMilU91vyesTKvsZE6l9dlL1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dusty Wyatt","credit_id":"55edab699251413e32014ee3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":130193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dusty Anderson","original_name":"Dusty Anderson","popularity":0.1886,"profile_path":"/fyTwTybLy3HAePSiKEpvvcm7RtJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Helen Wyatt","credit_id":"55edab7192514106d600dbfc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guinn \"Big Boy\" Williams","original_name":"Guinn \"Big Boy\" Williams","popularity":0.2441,"profile_path":"/oOJIg1Cnsc9IsT1861kLxyQjkuy.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Big Boy Webster","credit_id":"55edab7d9251413e3e015906","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1506695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Four Chicks and a Chuck","original_name":"Four Chicks and a Chuck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Speciality Act","credit_id":"55ee25f3c3a3682c6b015952","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1506698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Trietsch","original_name":"Paul Trietsch","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Hezzie (of The Hoosier Hot Shots)","credit_id":"55ee25f49251413e4101632d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1506699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Trietsch","original_name":"Ken Trietsch","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Ken (of The Hoosier Hot Shots)","credit_id":"55ee25f4c3a368090c006a1c","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1506700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gil Taylor","original_name":"Gil Taylor","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Gil (of The Hoosier Hot Shots)","credit_id":"55ee25f59251413e3e017387","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1506701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Ward","original_name":"Charles Ward","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Gabe (of The Hoosier Hot Shots)","credit_id":"55ee25f5c3a3682c6b01595a","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Keith","original_name":"Ian Keith","popularity":0.2021,"profile_path":"/naYkm9Y17y0CYjW26ZoH8tEcLSG.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Jerry Easton","credit_id":"55ee25f59251413e45016572","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Willis","original_name":"Matt Willis","popularity":0.1213,"profile_path":"/ov8xHQ0YDcFdVmGqA1zMz0lTpVI.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Dan Prichard","credit_id":"55ee25f6c3a3682c5d0186b9","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120736,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Flint","original_name":"Sam Flint","popularity":0.3098,"profile_path":"/iZXn3Myb6SVQifYpWt1aixEyqWJ.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Terrence Mallory","credit_id":"55ee25f69251413e41016331","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":159549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Haworth","original_name":"Joe Haworth","popularity":0.1526,"profile_path":"/p1khkDcEnfAxJebs3G8efnHUJVN.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Pete -
