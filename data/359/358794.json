Surajbhan (Mukesh Rishi) is the name of one such despot and Shantinagar is the base of his illegal activities. D.C.P. Shrivastav (Mohan Joshi) and Inspector Thapar (Shiva) are hand-in-glove with him. Krishna (Sunil Shetty) is a victim of Surajbhan's atrocities and has returned from jail after serving a sentence. He learns of Surajbhan's renewed reign of terror and the growth of his illegal activities. How Krishna frees Shantinagar from the clutches of Surajbhan, forms the crux of the film.","popularity":0.2906,"poster_path":"/irPukH7N7xlUHl4lGb4uTCwcjxF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maseeha","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suniel Shetty","original_name":"Suniel Shetty","popularity":1.0965,"profile_path":"/8zdduuPcsoUtBbCA8rl17X44jwe.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6554a4f753866e00abaab565","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":87849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Namrata Shirodkar","original_name":"Namrata Shirodkar","popularity":0.2739,"profile_path":"/hQ0RYfjDiTkyTawyAQh7b1sHEmC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6554a507ac416100ad27e40b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1956269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inder Kumar","original_name":"Inder Kumar","popularity":0.1625,"profile_path":"/yKgnbdKZ5KndIKsktlLLPOMy3gn.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6554a51267b61345cd342ccf","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Partho Ghosh","original_name":"Partho Ghosh","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6554a552ea84c71093005286","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0341458","wikidata_id":"Q6782947","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1333,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/irPukH7N7xlUHl4lGb4uTCwcjxF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":315446,"name":"bollywood"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
