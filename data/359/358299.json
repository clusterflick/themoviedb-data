It is also about the shop steward organising a strike at Paul's factory that jeopardises the deal with the industrialist, and about the wife of the shop steward, who happens to clean and cook for the industrialist. A network of intertwined tales told in different ways, and for very different motives, by the main protagonists.","popularity":0.1129,"poster_path":"/uusynlgnUFuyDWPVm1SltWWWcqJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Telling Tales","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1705830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bridget Ashburn","original_name":"Bridget Ashburn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Sheila Jones","credit_id":"5821dbf0925141097800224e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1217106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Woolley","original_name":"James Woolley","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mr Willoughby/Paul Roberts","credit_id":"5821dc0c925141097800226d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1705832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Donovan","original_name":"Patricia Donovan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Mrs Willoughby/Ingrid Roberts","credit_id":"5821dc2ac3a36863e5009d90","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1705833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Trafford","original_name":"Stephen Trafford","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Bill Jones","credit_id":"5821dc3dc3a36863e8009986","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1297094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Woolley","original_name":"Richard Woolley","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55eaef0cc3a3687d3b00325b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1863396","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.657,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uusynlgnUFuyDWPVm1SltWWWcqJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":985}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
