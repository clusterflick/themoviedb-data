A roving camera and smooth theme music say more than words. London's traditional sights - Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar Square, the Royal Parks, the Zoo, etc., await their visitors in the early morning. While a young motor-cyclist hurries by, to work on the pleasure boat he conducts along the Thames; a Beefeater goes on duty at the Tower; and the visitors hurry into London by bus and coach. The film conjures up the mood of a variety of London scenes and events throughout the day until a sightseeing-bus tour gives the visitor a last chance to catch up by night on anything he may have missed during the day.","popularity":0.0423,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":52835,"logo_path":null,"name":"British Transport Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1962-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"London for a Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086467,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Edgar Anstey","original_name":"Edgar Anstey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/eJdn6dkMbySMdMXfj2dMGAECgRH.jpg","credit_id":"676e61704ca2fbbfca61638d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3287028,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bill Le Sage","original_name":"Bill Le Sage","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676e618a4ca2fbbfca616394","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2383538,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jack West","original_name":"Jack West","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676e619caa8f3159d612af8b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5143174,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Woolf","original_name":"Ian Woolf","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676e6248e2976ba75b92a7f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5143174,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Woolf","original_name":"Ian Woolf","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676e6252cfe62644df12b022","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5331012","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1962-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
