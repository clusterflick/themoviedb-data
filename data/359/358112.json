Although clearly intended as a hymn to royal life, with a panting narration describing the bliss Charles, Anne and Andrew are experiencing (the film was made three years before the birth of Edward), the images tell a different story - only a couple of shots feature the children smiling, while the first glimpse of Andrew as a baby, a spotlight shining on his face as photographers snap away, is a faintly sinister symbol of the royals’ lack of privacy from birth. The knowledge that a future of divorce and tabloid scandal would tarnish these children's adult lives adds irony to this snapshot of supposed utopia.","popularity":0.4448,"poster_path":"/ht48yfe1JZrnGuwEh3PlURdoxtE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7281,"logo_path":"/iI7qdR1OFPo0U41BlpKBLD3xesh.png","name":"BFI","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":8598,"logo_path":"/pFhDa84YifM8WUjeoBw3hkl2fRC.png","name":"COI","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":4894,"logo_path":null,"name":"Associated British-Pathé","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1961-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Royal Children","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":558240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom","original_name":"Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom","popularity":0.4598,"profile_path":"/rO3H0ndtekEtNzRScYQMREiB3gI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64ef62c6dbbb42013a224107","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1164486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh","original_name":"Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh","popularity":0.1193,"profile_path":"/uPfQY4f2uJP6TJVg7BdLzp0lzce.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64ef62d53a9937011cbd2dff","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":174981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"King Charles III of the United Kingdom","original_name":"King Charles III of the United Kingdom","popularity":0.2176,"profile_path":"/9WlQBs2v4QTbA1SOrlyyPG4MdN9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64ef62df77d23b0150389e46","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2041195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Prince Andrew, Duke of York","original_name":"Prince Andrew, Duke of York","popularity":0.1491,"profile_path":"/t24davTFnyqs8CmrqMYy6VsOmte.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64ef62e597a4e600c4863cd3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1164487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne, Princess Royal","original_name":"Anne, Princess Royal","popularity":0.1476,"profile_path":"/nQ051YvpE7IzmmGSITbxYkcqag.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64ef62ec3a993700ada9bea5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1164488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Princess Margaret","original_name":"Princess Margaret","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":"/bfZqr5nGaZ4tLOBvBXitX2vh8uS.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64ef9b61ebb99d00e3e735d0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":126211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother","original_name":"Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother","popularity":0.1285,"profile_path":"/pHZyHEc1xI60yi9Ie8h55alH4mP.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"64ef9b65e0ca7f00ec865c70","order":6}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2162966","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ht48yfe1JZrnGuwEh3PlURdoxtE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1961-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
