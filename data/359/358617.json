S. Marshals Nevada Jack McKenzie and Sandy Hopkins come upon an overturned stagecoach with the driver and the passenger dead. They learn that the passenger, Hinkley, an archaeologist, has discovered an old Indian site that contains gold relics, and a gang has robbed him of the relics he was carrying. Jane Condon, daughter of Hinkley's partner who was also murdered, tells Nevada that an old Indian guide, Shag, is the only one who knows where the site is. The outlaws find Shag first, and kill him after forcing the information from him. Hinkley's son, Joel, arrives and knows where the site is and leads Nevada and Sandy there ahead of the outlaws.","popularity":1.0364,"poster_path":"/h1RZ01uOnEu7RlfysLzgOnasmDl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4395,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monogram Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":16616,"logo_path":null,"name":"Willis Kent Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1945-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"THE LAW OF THE SIX-GUN!","title":"Gun Smoke","video":false,"vote_average":3.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Mack Brown","original_name":"Johnny Mack Brown","popularity":0.1439,"profile_path":"/ybBL0QUDeYqwuDOenOl8N1ACaal.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Marshal Nevada Jack McKenzie","credit_id":"55eda9f3c3a3682c640133f8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Hatton","original_name":"Raymond Hatton","popularity":0.1989,"profile_path":"/eTiQiDcMhwD3DCE6yINa7RKd5NJ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Marshal Sandy","credit_id":"55eda9fcc3a3682c640133fc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Holt","original_name":"Jennifer Holt","popularity":0.2992,"profile_path":"/hj2maSjgsyEsJsP0gNSGGVo6D2y.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jane Condon","credit_id":"55edaa05c3a3687d3b00d9fd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Riley Hill","original_name":"Riley Hill","popularity":0.1507,"profile_path":"/y71rcAdXTbJKpd86n32wlhcsF8Q.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Joel Hinkley","credit_id":"55edaa0ec3a3682c620159df","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1434786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wen Wright","original_name":"Wen Wright","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Henchman Knuckles","credit_id":"55ee33f6c3a3682c5d018b4c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":215709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Bennett","original_name":"Ray Bennett","popularity":0.2675,"profile_path":"/bk9RIMDkV9AuS0uRGlcl6jQGVMq.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Lucky Baker","credit_id":"55ee33f6c3a3682c6b015dc0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Clark","original_name":"Steve Clark","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":"/a0lfrbHO67CKwj7JGk0zYw23nqV.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Sheep Herder (uncredited)","credit_id":"55ee33f6c3a3682c64014eab","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marshall Reed","original_name":"Marshall Reed","popularity":0.2182,"profile_path":"/kMniZFRQRqC1znX5sH9SdjUr2Yy.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Henchman Cyclone","credit_id":"55ee33f7c3a3687d3b00f713","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":217750,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Cason","original_name":"John Cason","popularity":0.3634,"profile_path":"/lPE2XWdHXTXFZhvYhFOpSVNrivj.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Henchman Red","credit_id":"55ee33f7c3a368090c006e0b","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Ellis","original_name":"Frank Ellis","popularity":0.2555,"profile_path":"/q77hl9id06wVFF827PWHYalEajX.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Henchman Deuce","credit_id":"55ee33f79251413e2f016749","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Butler","original_name":"Roy Butler","popularity":0.0902,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Sheriff","credit_id":"55ee33f8c3a3682c6b015dc2","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120796,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Howard Bretherton","original_name":"Howard Bretherton","popularity":0.2324,"profile_path":"/2vwnfBXVdqEbubippSECEIyBLJ3.jpg","credit_id":"55eda9e892514106d600dbb3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1040967,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Walker","original_name":"Francis Walker","popularity":0.1392,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"575511ecc3a3683c90000a45","department":"Crew","job":"Stunts"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346727,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Evan Lehman","original_name":"Paul Evan Lehman","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"575511a0925141338c0017e3","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88986,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Oliver Drake","original_name":"Oliver Drake","popularity":0.2234,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57551197c3a3685f81001f74","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88660,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"S.
