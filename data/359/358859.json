The USSR collapsed soon after, and the tricolour of the sovereign Russian Federation flew over Kremlin. As president Gorbachev was detained by the coup leaders, state-run TV and radio channels, usurped by the putschists, broadcast Tchaikovsky's \"Swan Lake\" instead of news bulletins, and crowds of protestors gathered around Moscow's White House, preparing to defend the stronghold of democratic opposition led by Boris Yeltsin, in the city of Leningrad thousands of confused, scared, excited and desperate people poured into the streets to become a part of the event, which was supposed to change their destiny. A quarter of a century later, Sergei Loznitsa revisits the dramatic moments of August 1991 and casts an eye on the event which was hailed worldwide as the birth of \"Russian democracy\".","popularity":0.3698,"poster_path":"/luBpB88457hAfBYVSN01rW5IG3f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109618,"logo_path":"/hHgwcVNXh3WE1UbtIOu8EcU7j3d.png","name":"Atoms & Void","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2015-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Three days that shook the world or much ado about nothing?","title":"The Event","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Sobytie","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":543674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergei Loznitsa","original_name":"Sergei Loznitsa","popularity":0.1481,"profile_path":"/gxs4Qqw5DjgbChJNU9cZ3UkK9Vw.jpg","credit_id":"55ef43689251413e4501a7de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":543674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergei Loznitsa","original_name":"Sergei Loznitsa","popularity":0.1481,"profile_path":"/gxs4Qqw5DjgbChJNU9cZ3UkK9Vw.jpg","credit_id":"5bdf122092514137cb025749","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":543674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergei Loznitsa","original_name":"Sergei Loznitsa","popularity":0.1481,"profile_path":"/gxs4Qqw5DjgbChJNU9cZ3UkK9Vw.jpg","credit_id":"5bdf13f3c3a3682b2f0271eb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1887988,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maria Choustova","original_name":"Maria Choustova","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bdf13b392514137e20251d4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":927436,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Danielius Kokanauskis","original_name":"Danielius Kokanauskis","popularity":0.0592,"profile_path":"/pw94GSlRoD9G7BJAfVragQAekpT.jpg","credit_id":"5bdf1215c3a3682b3202a788","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238623,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vladimir Golovnitsky","original_name":"Vladimir Golovnitsky","popularity":0.0832,"profile_path":"/l31CZDOz3llbpOHVBM38kI1Ov5w.jpg","credit_id":"5bdf13d9c3a3682b2f0271d9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":543674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergei Loznitsa","original_name":"Sergei Loznitsa","popularity":0.1481,"profile_path":"/gxs4Qqw5DjgbChJNU9cZ3UkK9Vw.jpg","credit_id":"5bdf1495c3a3682b3902870c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4900156","wikidata_id":"Q22192553","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eVu1plvnz12ajuuSQONhyzAwNcU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1924,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/71bSbtUObnimQU9Vz9GS1EMyCIw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3420}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":5.191,"height":199,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iOuQ4Fi5H1FIZSZQKeHCuQsYKZQ.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1033},{"aspect_ratio":5.171,"height":140,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/dnyCX8WZgJKWzQNqNDmzWtZr0QU.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":724}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/luBpB88457hAfBYVSN01rW5IG3f.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1143,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/1m7D2BJS3bHGNTLtoFZhQE0AuvG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":762},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":770,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/awttWQKiefIN2UM63omcEtoL8KG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":513},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1014,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/friHY9WSf5VrrXQOc7jWYreJOtn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":676}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"THE EVENT Trailer | Festvial 2015","key":"WP8XhlL9HEQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-08-26T19:39:58.000Z","id":"6410fa24b4224200826eddc3"}]}}}
