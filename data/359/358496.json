Out of the 20,000 churches in Britain, the artist, John Piper, whose work contributes to the glory of England's churches, selects and describes a church built in each of the last nine centuries, from Norman times to the present day. Accompanied by the music of Peter Racine Fricker, he reveals the beauty and riches of architecture, decoration, carving and sculpture aged in mellow stone and weathered glass; the art of the wood carver and the sculptor, and in doing so finds that through the centuries the portrayal of the human face and figure has been an unfailing source of inspiration to all who have brought their talents to the service of the Church.","popularity":0.1557,"poster_path":"/ozDFy6NxamkSATZ4pRYJBKR7mLC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52835,"logo_path":null,"name":"British Transport Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1959-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Artist Looks at Churches","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2892596,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Piper","original_name":"John Piper","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fd69f68db952d00407c508a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1192070,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Taylor","original_name":"John Taylor","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fa79e4cf62cd0079df62c3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1192070,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Taylor","original_name":"John Taylor","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea92b48426ae8001f49ca55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086467,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Edgar Anstey","original_name":"Edgar Anstey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/eJdn6dkMbySMdMXfj2dMGAECgRH.jpg","credit_id":"5ea92b7b514c4a00218c7173","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2892600,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Peter Racine Fricker","original_name":"Peter Racine Fricker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd69f401d3143003db90e6e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127368,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"John Legard","original_name":"John Legard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd69f50eb0932003ebf075e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2892596,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Piper","original_name":"John Piper","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd69f083a340b00415a46de","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1850332","wikidata_id":"Q123288154","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":762,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ozDFy6NxamkSATZ4pRYJBKR7mLC.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":509}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1959-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
