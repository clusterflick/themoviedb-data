The first time was in 1963, the same year as the Commonwealth visit by the President of India. The second cancellation occurred in 1965 when a longstanding dispute between India and Pakistan over the sovereignty of Kashmir boiled over into full-scale war in September of that year. However, as one might expect from a film made for international diplomacy purposes no reference is made to ongoing political problems either at home or abroad. Like the Indian presidential visit of 1963, the film was for screening to domestic audiences (both in the UK and in Pakistan) whose main interest would be in the pomp and ceremony of the visit, and the reception and status afforded to the President by the Queen and royal family.","popularity":0.1777,"poster_path":"/6lyJ2RLE4wwi4umIjR3Epa9K6D8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7281,"logo_path":"/iI7qdR1OFPo0U41BlpKBLD3xesh.png","name":"BFI","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":8598,"logo_path":"/pFhDa84YifM8WUjeoBw3hkl2fRC.png","name":"COI","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":124028,"logo_path":null,"name":"British Path√©","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1966-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Britain Welcomes the President of Pakistan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":558240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom","original_name":"Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom","popularity":0.4598,"profile_path":"/rO3H0ndtekEtNzRScYQMREiB3gI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65008699d7dcd200acb05747","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4267622,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Muhammad Ayub Khan","original_name":"Muhammad Ayub Khan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"650086d41bf26600c5d5f525","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4267621,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joan Duff","original_name":"Joan Duff","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6500868fffc9de0ee3c5ee69","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2162982","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6lyJ2RLE4wwi4umIjR3Epa9K6D8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1966-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
