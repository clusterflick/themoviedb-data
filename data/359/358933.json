Somewhat abstracted, a solid, a liquid and a gas: salt, milk and smoke: falling, pouring and rising are the stars of this classical film. Sheets, streaks and wisps, the protagonists are all white (light). The background, zero place, is black (no light). Silence. The ongoing film reveals the ephemera compartmented in a pattern of temporal proportions in which lengths of salt sheet activity are gradually overtaken by liquid streaks which are in turn overtaken by smoke drifts. But another solid is the sliceable, arrangeable film material itself: the intercutting and the logic of the arrangement introduces something diamond-like, sculptural to the natures presented. There is a profoundly satisfying unity of ends and means that is both 'natural' (the way the protagonists behave) and 'artificial' (the artist's structure). The sum is cultured, beautiful.\" - Michael Snow","popularity":0.0414,"poster_path":"/oib9JgU2kVrlSFKFSDLT0qxGrKP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"States","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092209,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hollis Frampton","original_name":"Hollis Frampton","popularity":0.0766,"profile_path":"/94kbHx8NNf5WlZZlq6F94coSmyL.jpg","credit_id":"55efa4fbc3a3682c64019bca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.693,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oib9JgU2kVrlSFKFSDLT0qxGrKP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":520}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1967-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
