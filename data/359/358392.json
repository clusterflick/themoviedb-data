It tells the tale of a group of ragtag soldiers who, whilst searching for an AWOL section, inadvertently disturb an unholy grave site. Day turns to night and the mildly forested area becomes a thick, dense jungle. Ill-equipped and without an inkling as to why these supernatural events have cursed them, they race against time within the cursed island in their fight for survival - uncovering past mysteries and hidden secrets - while being terrorized by the revenge-seeking spirits of a native woman and her child who were victimized and murdered by a witch doctor over a century ago.  - Written by Esan Sivalingam","popularity":0.5009,"poster_path":"/nfuTU8dCm0003WD9K2s1xyVqes2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2008-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pulau Hantu","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Ghost Island","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Ng Yiu-Hon","original_name":"吳耀漢","popularity":0.8163,"profile_path":"/8ZyqXi66gyxeR5crT51TJ6YTMWM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Heng's Father","credit_id":"646f19df17c4430136088c92","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137146,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Ng Ka-Lung","original_name":"吳嘉龍","popularity":0.364,"profile_path":"/5b2MM6hPv9uwgjylePjhkWZIEGu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Heng Ing How","credit_id":"646f19ed07216600dd68a49b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":570524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Cheng","original_name":"John Cheng","popularity":0.0852,"profile_path":"/9ca0G3ONL4PP6ZJq7J6GFafiTug.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Frankie Low","credit_id":"646f1a06e22d2816ac710aee","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1211862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adrian Pang","original_name":"Adrian Pang","popularity":0.1321,"profile_path":"/fOSFPav79lx1YmSj1R1IrsZ87On.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Major Damian Lee","credit_id":"646f1a1307216600dd68a4b1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":991930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pamelyn Chee","original_name":"Pamelyn Chee","popularity":0.176,"profile_path":"/iwLwtVLKEYDwvbOhKD3g0FNALXR.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"June Fong","credit_id":"646f1a26894ed60133b19430","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":570506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Thia","original_name":"Henry Thia","popularity":0.1003,"profile_path":"/xtHCo2OeRuWRa63ff0svZI5GNRU.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Henchmen","credit_id":"646f1a3b1130bd01ef3fb1e3","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2500983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Esan Sivalingam","original_name":"Esan Sivalingam","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626ff13d6f53e11b4bba3b0d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1264107","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":778,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nfuTU8dCm0003WD9K2s1xyVqes2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
