He was the first artist in Australia to animate cartoons for films. He successfully used caricature and satire to comment on the social, political and economic impact of World War One â€“ from the Allies point of view. Julius's drawn animation regularly includes the appearance of animals representing the major war countries including: a battered fez-capped turkey (Turkey); a large aggressive eagle (the United States); and a Union Jack-covered bulldog or lion (the United Kingdom).","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1915-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Collected Cartoons of the Moment by Harry Julius","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1505908,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Julius","original_name":"Harry Julius","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55ec01819251413e3a00eb36","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1915-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
