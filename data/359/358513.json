On the eve of the presidential elections that could spell the end of the Spielberg administration, the gates of a number of Bangland residents become entangled: Charlie Tucano and Tony Beretta, modern-day inquisitors working for the influential television evangelist, Gold; Loogie Boogie, an Irish loan shark with a dysfunctional family; and Dante Black, a screenwriter for TV who's wound up on the evangelist's bad side.","popularity":0.1556,"poster_path":"/7aEzeWRKMjiTXPRr7tfxBK35dRu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130815,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rofilm","origin_country":""},{"id":130816,"logo_path":null,"name":"Axelotil Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2015-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bangland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31010,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gianluca Arcopinto","original_name":"Gianluca Arcopinto","popularity":0.1088,"profile_path":"/2sI97j4WE00lLJDFJIBhgFR8GQz.jpg","credit_id":"6218f13fa27502001b6ac3bf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1506065,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lorenzo Berghella","original_name":"Lorenzo Berghella","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55eca1609251413e32010a93","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1506071,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alessandro Berghella","original_name":"Alessandro Berghella","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55eca2d4c3a3682c70010a15","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1506070,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Fabio D'Onofrio","original_name":"Fabio D'Onofrio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55eca2c69251413e4101089b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1506065,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lorenzo Berghella","original_name":"Lorenzo Berghella","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55eca1c4c3a3685375003ba7","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1506072,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marco Palma","original_name":"Marco Palma","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55eca2ea9251413e32010aee","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1506069,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cristiano Di Felice","original_name":"Cristiano Di Felice","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55eca28bc3a3682c62011572","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1506065,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lorenzo Berghella","original_name":"Lorenzo Berghella","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55eca13392514106d6009a4d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1506068,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alessandro Di Felice","original_name":"Alessandro Di Felice","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55eca2659251413e3a010cf3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1506065,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lorenzo Berghella","original_name":"Lorenzo Berghella","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55eca14c9251413e3e01152a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1506065,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lorenzo Berghella","original_name":"Lorenzo Berghella","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55eca1749251413e3e011534","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5641696","wikidata_id":"Q63498526","facebook_id":"Banglandmovie","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/peEFJmUoRpBAetK9VpXFpgjuHbC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eSUfw01OCB6tUNUaN5TRSBvWwfz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7aEzeWRKMjiTXPRr7tfxBK35dRu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":713}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":13015,"name":"terrorism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Venice Film Festival - Giornate degli Autori","release_date":"2015-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Trieste Science+Fiction Festival","release_date":"2015-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bangland international trailer","key":"J1pNkI0QbQI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-04-21T16:19:04.000Z","id":"5e73d610a055ef001628f996"}]}}}
