The destinations on this month long excursion included: British Guiana; Trinidad and Tobago; Grenada; St. Vincent; Barbados; St. Lucia; Dominica; Montserrat; Antigua; St. Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla; Tortola (Virgin Islands); the Bahamas; Jamaica. This rich and detailed Technicolor travelogue was the only film authorised by the Palace.  Strict instructions were given prior to the production being given the green light, most notably that the royals could only be filmed when ‘engaged in a public function’. Unlike the more relaxed footage or interviews you might see with the royals now the film is visually very official in tone.","popularity":0.2923,"poster_path":"/1ryip9KWF0kSsbDMOgKL1DaFRLZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7281,"logo_path":"/iI7qdR1OFPo0U41BlpKBLD3xesh.png","name":"BFI","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":8598,"logo_path":"/pFhDa84YifM8WUjeoBw3hkl2fRC.png","name":"COI","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":124028,"logo_path":null,"name":"British Pathé","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1966-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Royal Tour of the Caribbean","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":558240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom","original_name":"Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom","popularity":0.4598,"profile_path":"/rO3H0ndtekEtNzRScYQMREiB3gI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"650081591bf266011c782e7a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1164486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh","original_name":"Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh","popularity":0.1193,"profile_path":"/uPfQY4f2uJP6TJVg7BdLzp0lzce.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6500815ed7dcd200c536aef0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2383728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonard Martin","original_name":"Leonard Martin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Commentary (voice)","credit_id":"650081bcdb4ed610430923e9","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4267598,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"A James","original_name":"A James","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65008194e0ca7f00ec8d05af","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2122066,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Derek Mayne","original_name":"Derek Mayne","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65008182e0ca7f00ae3f5756","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2164610","wikidata_id":"Q16934430","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1ryip9KWF0kSsbDMOgKL1DaFRLZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1966-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
