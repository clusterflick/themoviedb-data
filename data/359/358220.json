Mehta, the film released on 6 February 2015  The story revolves around Bottle Mani (Sharan), a lame duck, who takes a supari to kill Neelakanta Raju (Ramakrishna), an elderly person from a royal family. He's been assigned the job by none other than the old man's three sons-in-law, who want to grab his property. Mani is assisted by his uncle (Tabla Nani) but he faces a lot of problems in the palace as the family is huge. He misses a couple of chances to kill Raju. There's a twist in the tale when the real Bottle Mani (Ravishankar) walks out of jail only to find that a fraud has usurped his identity and entered the palace. Henceforth, it's only chaos that reigns supreme.","popularity":0.6454,"poster_path":"/w00YbiLqYRgjthK0ccV9wrO6em5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2015-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kannada","iso_639_1":"kn","name":"?????"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raja Rajendra","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1293554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharan","original_name":"Sharan","popularity":0.099,"profile_path":"/lGaKpSOhdjeDuev9lL5EZDAh9ro.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Mani / Bottle Mani","credit_id":"63a444fb64f71600bd5e9b26","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1527501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ishita Dutta","original_name":"Ishita Dutta","popularity":0.1335,"profile_path":"/fO1yfVsuy5z71SFJUvNtS2rcp8m.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Swathi","credit_id":"63a40bd7e24b93008c8ed8b0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":579808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramakrishna","original_name":"Ramakrishna","popularity":0.0903,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Neelakanta Raju","credit_id":"63a43c0825a5362376d4c274","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1293540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"P.
