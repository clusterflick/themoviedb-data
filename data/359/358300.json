Walking up a street of back-to-back houses – and still in her daydream – ANNE bumps into an old woman  sending her shopping flying. A lucky accident as the old woman's grandson, RALPH, turns out to be exactly the boy she is looking for... well, nearly – he does have a strange penchant for art galleries and Elgar. But ANNE doesn't only fall in love. Discovering that not everyone is as rich as her, she determines to balance things out by persuading RALPH to take part in an unusual form of burglary. She assures him that if things go wrong, she will own up and say it was her fault. \"They'll never believe you!\" says Ralph. And they don't.","popularity":0.3735,"poster_path":"/jqY67y5vGhVlG69pr5uuhHjELAP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1988-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Girl from the South","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1705847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michelle Mulvaney","original_name":"Michelle Mulvaney","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Anne","credit_id":"5821dd5792514109d8002361","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1705846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Crowshaw","original_name":"Mark Crowshaw","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ralph","credit_id":"5821dd41c3a36863e8009a72","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":93167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosamund Greenwood","original_name":"Rosamund Greenwood","popularity":0.1592,"profile_path":"/qgZg7SjXJ5NtngOQ125bz5gSSdd.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Granny White","credit_id":"5821dd6c9251413cf700a0dd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1213513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daphne Oxenford","original_name":"Daphne Oxenford","popularity":0.1409,"profile_path":"/PvyVVk0qEFBTWoxmq8ZuMlEy5Z.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Grandmother","credit_id":"5821dd0bc3a3686a5f002402","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1705843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Thompson","original_name":"Alan Thompson","popularity":0.0941,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Grandfather","credit_id":"5821dcfcc3a368697b002471","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1705845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Weinstein","original_name":"Keith Weinstein","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Lance","credit_id":"5821dd25c3a36863e8009a5a","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1297094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Woolley","original_name":"Richard Woolley","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55eaef6e9251413e3a00a5d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1863254","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":917,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jqY67y5vGhVlG69pr5uuhHjELAP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":611}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
