Their first strike is by a suicide squad that detonates a truckload of explosives at an army base in Washington DC. FBI probes indicate that the attack is by Arab terrorists led by Iranians. Subsequent attacks are via airplanes exploded in mid-air, crowded restaurants, and an attack on a mall. Administration cabinet heads push the President to retaliate. The director of the FBI believes that there may be more to the story than the investigation has revealed and the Secretary of Defense is the only other person urging caution.","popularity":2.5882,"poster_path":"/bA5ZTO6kcnQTt9A3M3Zg4SAauvr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":136,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Under Siege","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"Ultimate Terrorism","type":"VHS"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Strauss","original_name":"Peter Strauss","popularity":0.9107,"profile_path":"/nu2QWP09Ju0eMabE0hEmYjm1c6V.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"John Garry","credit_id":"55e9bf849251413e350063f8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mason Adams","original_name":"Mason Adams","popularity":0.2813,"profile_path":"/zhr8dZBGhJuTR454E7A3flHzhre.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Geoffrey Wiggins","credit_id":"55e9bf8e9251413e3200653a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lew Ayres","original_name":"Lew Ayres","popularity":0.4086,"profile_path":"/nNinKMWvSxrhiNMnMkbpUd4HEZO.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"John Pace","credit_id":"55e9bf969251413e3e006ad0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Grizzard","original_name":"George Grizzard","popularity":0.6113,"profile_path":"/nGhVTWuoYbYfTnzZqxrWY9F0p6p.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Warren Richards","credit_id":"55e9bfa39251413e2f0064f9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hal Holbrook","original_name":"Hal Holbrook","popularity":0.9126,"profile_path":"/cnhje99hbqldY1wimQTKpApvj1n.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"President Maxwell Monroe","credit_id":"55e9bfacc3a3682c64005f00","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"E.G.
