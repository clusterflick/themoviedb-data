They exaggerate the unreality and clinical perfection of the Hollywood studio films of the 1950s, quoting its sets and colours (Home Stories, 1990; Pensão Globo, 1997) or even reconstructing them in minute detail (Alpsee, 1994). But, at the same time, these attributes, known in film jargon as the production values, are exposed to decay – a decay which on closer inspection proves to include wilful acts of creation. As his own lab technician, Müller is responsible not only for subsequent wear and tear, but also for the initial developing of his own film material.","popularity":0.0895,"poster_path":"/4Vkcz8MEaEE7nKcldx6kLMGxPvt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Flamethrowers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1201127,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthias Müller","original_name":"Matthias Müller","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":"/gi38yN87M4mgcsNCkViWLCeVXnV.jpg","credit_id":"55efb3b3c3a3681e6a003442","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1507277,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Owen O'Toole","original_name":"Owen O'Toole","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55efb3c0c3a3682c6201d4db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1901538,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maija-Lene Rettig","original_name":"Maija-Lene Rettig","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6760c9f9849914f36ebafdca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1425201,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Schmelzdahin","original_name":"Schmelzdahin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6760ca01849914f36ebafdd5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":856,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4Vkcz8MEaEE7nKcldx6kLMGxPvt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":570}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":208733,"name":"video art"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Flamethrowers","key":"107374864","site":"Vimeo","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-09-28T07:37:46.000Z","id":"61ed57a4ce5d8200431a494e"}]}}}
