In Stuttgart, the Swabian publisher Annette meets the Polish master in the art of living Pawel, while her niece Nina is expecting a big fiesta in Spain, but meets only a deaf old man. In parallel Matti, a freshly minted high school graduate, hopes to find a great adventure in Paris, while the two Erasmus students Reka and Alma wander through Frankfurt desperately seeking their hosts. In the quest of adventure, diversion or just an authentic travel experience, encountering people whom one never would have met otherwise and so they are confronted not only with counterparts, but also with themselves.","popularity":0.4291,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Couchmovie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":39249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Dragus","original_name":"Maria Dragus","popularity":0.292,"profile_path":"/4AiU1EdwWlNuxBbYV1qLxc09mv1.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Reka (segment \"Frankfurt am Main\")","credit_id":"570cc1cc9251417951000671","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1184974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lore Richter","original_name":"Lore Richter","popularity":0.0672,"profile_path":"/fky6ypkkkv8gdsvxR5vpJZUu4CR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Nina (segment \"Santander\")","credit_id":"570cc175c3a3684bfe0020b7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1603267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hélène Kuhn","original_name":"Hélène Kuhn","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/w0RzJuKBP4X5hHfrC2pCpyhOrW4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Cisem (segment \"Paris\")","credit_id":"570cc1a5c3a3684c15002170","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1192758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samuel Schneider","original_name":"Samuel Schneider","popularity":0.1038,"profile_path":"/8RTp1K4vMoNLfARV9ClmO60bXTn.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Matti (segment \"Paris\")","credit_id":"570cc1b1c3a3684c1b001f8a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1363012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Babett Arens","original_name":"Babett Arens","popularity":0.1074,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Annette (segment \"Stuttgart\")","credit_id":"570cc1479251416ce8001d30","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1604664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maxime Beugin","original_name":"Maxime Beugin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Serge (segment \"Paris\")","credit_id":"570cc16592514136b900115e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":72850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilja Pletner","original_name":"Ilja Pletner","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Pawel (segment \"Stuttgart\")","credit_id":"570cc1879251416cee001e47","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1604667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah-Megan Allouch","original_name":"Sarah-Megan Allouch","popularity":0.1139,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Louise (segment \"Paris\")","credit_id":"570cc197c3a3684c01001c25","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1323231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Woigk","original_name":"Helen Woigk","popularity":0.1101,"profile_path":"/tTbxO0icDX4bnD1Y98CGnNbqaq1.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Alma (segment \"Frankfurt am Main\")","credit_id":"570cc1bf9251411c170015e8","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1604672,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julia Golembiowski","original_name":"Julia Golembiowski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"570cc2a09251411c17001615","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1604671,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nathalie Kraft","original_name":"Nathalie Kraft","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"570cc2919251417951000690","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1604673,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isabel Braak","original_name":"Isabel Braak","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"570cc2cb925141798f000697","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3035836","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":219381,"name":"couchsurfing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Couchmovie Titelsequenz | Motion Design (2013)","key":"GjtWONUk1So","published_at":"2014-06-02T15:47:30.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"55f02415c3a3682c6b01c9c6"}]}}}
