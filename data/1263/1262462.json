My animations were particularly inspired by two images, first a photography of roses and second a photography of telegraphic wires, suggesting on the one hand an intimate and enclosed universe and, on the other, an infinite opening of space full of potential messages. I have reworked and developed them into an almost abstract meditative drama, caught in a tension between those two photographs.","popularity":0.0985,"poster_path":"/rWyMbJzIJqJtZqIZ2MBY956pzEF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2005-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Variations on Two Photographs of Tina Modotti","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Hébert","original_name":"Pierre Hébert","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/aLY4pKVeXedvNa7iJ5iW4lgLPMK.jpg","credit_id":"65fbb3ba60620a017c2683a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Hébert","original_name":"Pierre Hébert","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/aLY4pKVeXedvNa7iJ5iW4lgLPMK.jpg","credit_id":"65fbb3d360620a013025336c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Hébert","original_name":"Pierre Hébert","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/aLY4pKVeXedvNa7iJ5iW4lgLPMK.jpg","credit_id":"65fbb3e660620a017c2683d1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2058531,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michel F.
