Participating in events and rituals which involve pitting your best against another and finding out who is better. Sport. The physical exertion of mind and body- as an individual or part of a team. Sport pushes those who strive forward to the peaks of their physical limits. The dedication to training to become better, both physically and mentally, as well as the adoration of fans supporting your every move, elevates sporting activities to one of the most sought-after social interactions anyone can experience. Since the tribal days of early humans to the warrior families of Sparta, humanity's athletic prowess has always been a factor in achieving greatness.","popularity":0.2269,"poster_path":"/lACgsRicaJSRiYmddSeVENKHZov.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ten Sporting Moments that Changed the World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3559296,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Remarni Ramchaitar-Jackman","original_name":"Remarni Ramchaitar-Jackman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67508f4275055863e8544460","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3559296,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Remarni Ramchaitar-Jackman","original_name":"Remarni Ramchaitar-Jackman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67508f466e101d94911a68e3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3559296,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Remarni Ramchaitar-Jackman","original_name":"Remarni Ramchaitar-Jackman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67508f4bcb1e120ccb5dddbd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2885759,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danielle Winter","original_name":"Danielle Winter","popularity":0.1124,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67508f5175055863e8544468","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932219,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brian Aabech","original_name":"Brian Aabech","popularity":0.1926,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67508f5e75055863e8544478","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2047372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jordan Hill","original_name":"Jordan Hill","popularity":0.1254,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67508f6675055863e8544481","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2200770,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christian Tanto","original_name":"Christian Tanto","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67508f6f6e101d94911a690a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28717511","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lACgsRicaJSRiYmddSeVENKHZov.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
