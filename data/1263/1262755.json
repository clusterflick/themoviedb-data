The viewer is then led through the cool and silent interior of a chic, white apartment. This journey is continued by the woman in the tape, who, we discover, must secretly distance herself from her life, and her life style, which consists of empty aesthetics and unfulfilled desires. The tape ends with a conversation between the woman and the man that not only reflects a glaring lack of communication, it serves to underline the isolation of women.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/sGbc4SMn7bcMbAl7n72JAItZakF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1987-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Within Dialogue (Silence)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4606973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ottilie Mason","original_name":"Ottilie Mason","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65fc735ebe6d88014ab0e310","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4606977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark McFadden","original_name":"Mark McFadden","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65fc736f0bc5290162af5f98","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":227942,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Su Rynard","original_name":"Su Rynard","popularity":0.0962,"profile_path":"/lCIp1BFg0XF7JCPgH0Xq1i7aa0q.jpg","credit_id":"65fc739281140f017e0fb7a0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4606984,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Helen Humphreys","original_name":"Helen Humphreys","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fc73a804733f017de8c8f6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":227942,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Su Rynard","original_name":"Su Rynard","popularity":0.0962,"profile_path":"/lCIp1BFg0XF7JCPgH0Xq1i7aa0q.jpg","credit_id":"65fc73c11b1f3c0130956da9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":227942,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Su Rynard","original_name":"Su Rynard","popularity":0.0962,"profile_path":"/lCIp1BFg0XF7JCPgH0Xq1i7aa0q.jpg","credit_id":"65fc73d60bc529017cb0a836","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":227942,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Su Rynard","original_name":"Su Rynard","popularity":0.0962,"profile_path":"/lCIp1BFg0XF7JCPgH0Xq1i7aa0q.jpg","credit_id":"65fc73e281140f017e0fb83a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.663,"height":976,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sGbc4SMn7bcMbAl7n72JAItZakF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":647}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
