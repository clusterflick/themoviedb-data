On his day off, he goes to see the cherry blossoms. There he tries to focus, but does not know how to enjoy them like the other cherry blossom spectators. On his way home, he finds a women's discarded love doll who calls himself Nishi, who begs to return to his owner. The doll declares that since being separated that he has discovered a love for his owner he had not recognized before. The story of Nishi, made for the purpose of enjoyment, causes Utsumi to search his own feelings. Utsumi wonders if this might be the fun he is looking for and decides to return Nishi back to his owner.\"","popularity":0.049,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sakura","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3407267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kota Fuji","original_name":"Kota Fuji","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/gLJXuVNMYAI1DDlMpPukxHLsYOD.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Utsumi (as Kota Fuji)","credit_id":"65fc8f0e43494f017d78d4cb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4607319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryu Yoshikawa","original_name":"Ryu Yoshikawa","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Nishi","credit_id":"65fc8f340c1255017e0b68d3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2340512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Minami Kajihara","original_name":"Minami Kajihara","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/hAwdJvuFsYnkbRf2zxk0LjSs7V8.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"RIku","credit_id":"65fc8f520bc5290149ae6efa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1702921,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tokuhisa Yamashita","original_name":"Tokuhisa Yamashita","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65fc8f76770700017c08fc1d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":555605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naoki Yamada","original_name":"Naoki Yamada","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"65fc8f8e197de4013014467f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4607322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hirose Gakusyuin","original_name":"Hirose Gakusyuin","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"65fc8f970c1255017e0b6980","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3221413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jin Arai","original_name":"Jin Arai","popularity":0.0797,"profile_path":"/pDTA6OdKqVsIZkVYiLjgr3eMpoz.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"65fc8fa743494f014a78d219","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4607326,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Naoya Asanuma","original_name":"Naoya Asanuma","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fc906b197de4018614aaf8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3407267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kota Fuji","original_name":"Kota Fuji","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/gLJXuVNMYAI1DDlMpPukxHLsYOD.jpg","credit_id":"65fc907960620a017c27eb18","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4607324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eiichi Takahashi","original_name":"Eiichi Takahashi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fc903f0bc529017cb0ed7b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4607319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryu Yoshikawa","original_name":"Ryu Yoshikawa","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fc90827f6c8d01636c91ea","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4607324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eiichi Takahashi","original_name":"Eiichi Takahashi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fc90b081140f01650fc6a2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4607324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eiichi Takahashi","original_name":"Eiichi Takahashi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fc902443494f017d78d5ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1664501,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hiromitsu Nishimura","original_name":"Hiromitsu Nishimura","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e3eae60000000000b97c10","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4607327,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sa Yuu","original_name":"Sa Yuu","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e3eaf20000000000b97c16","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"SAKURA Trailer","key":"WWr9RfLCwsA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-09-02T06:42:47.000Z","id":"65fc8ec904733f017de90551"}]}}}
