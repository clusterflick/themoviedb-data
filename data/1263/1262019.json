For centuries, the landed gentry lead privileged lives in palatial mansions on vast rambling estates. Following Ireland’s independence, the community entered a period of decline, estates were broken up and today fewer than 30 families occupy their original estates.  The film presents a kaleidoscope of snapshots of this almost extinct tribe as they potter around their crumbling piles contemplating their lot. Among them are: Sir John Leslie, 96-year-old night-clubber of Castle Leslie; Olivia Durdin-Robertson of Huntington Castle, member of the Temple of Isis; Mark Bence Jones of Glenville, Co. Cork chronicler of his peers; and Josslyn Gore Booth as he leaves his Sligo home in Lissadell.  Filmed over ten years this documentary offers access to this rarefied world and its eccentric inhabitants.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":"/6X7aoTllmNvhcbA7FhxauC8K1Fg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Obese alcoholics, pillhead geriatric ravers and astral planing pensioners.
