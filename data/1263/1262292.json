Boško Obradović, dentist for children and youth from Pula, was one of those who recorded reality, warned of what was to come and knew that the past would always be manipulated. Almost 40 years ago, he wrote atomic verses, which we have been living for the past four decades, but still today. And every time, when hope was created, we would fail to find shelter... From the same mistakes and the same stumbles. Boško and others like him were neither prophets nor visionaries, but they knew what was coming after... After hellish drivers, new careerists, the third world war. In vain, he urged his own, but also all future generations not to whine. \"Made in Pula\", by Rada Đurić, is a film that reminds and believes. He owes it to all those who do not give up.","popularity":0.0386,"poster_path":"/6qzIT5yAfR46CX4MSooarfdkfWC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":891,"logo_path":null,"name":"N1","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2022-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"},{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Made in Pula","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4605118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rada Đurić","original_name":"Rada Đurić","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"65fb417d9408ec017dfb376a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4332288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruno Langer","original_name":"Bruno Langer","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"65fb41e15be00e017c6eab4d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3325723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dragan Velikić","original_name":"Dragan Velikić","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"65fb4344a84ff70163c5e8d3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4325462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nenad Marjanović 'Dr. Fric'","original_name":"Nenad Marjanović 'Dr. Fric'","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"65fb41e8a84ff7017dc5e8b0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4605122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Magdalena Vodopija","original_name":"Magdalena Vodopija","popularity":0.103,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"65fb4323a199a6017cde6224","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4605147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marko Borščak 'Anger'","original_name":"Marko Borščak 'Anger'","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"65fb437054508d017cf8efa6","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4605118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rada Đurić","original_name":"Rada Đurić","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fb4176d40d4c01306f60cf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4605121,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boško Marčetić","original_name":"Boško Marčetić","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fb419160620a017c25cb27","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6qzIT5yAfR46CX4MSooarfdkfWC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
