But does space exist, as we know it, when it’s unobserved or does it transmute into marvelous forms that instantly snap back to normality when observed by a conscious being. It seems that space is fixed and stationary, as we experience it, but again behind our backs it may be flowing like a liquid violating all physical assumptions. So when we open our eyes to the apparent world is our consciousness the determining factor defining space, suggesting there is no space devoid of consciousness and are we in space or is it in us.
