Filming every aspect of this covertly lethal mineral, from its molecular structure, and its industrial uses to its removal attempts, with a distinctively artistic and highly inspired cinematic language, the film constructs a mysterious cinematic landscape as unfamiliar as it is entrancing. Sarah del Pino, a multi-faceted and restless visual artist, delivers a film that defies every label but opens itself up to a wide range of interesting fields, steering thoughts and senses to unpredictable, prolific paths.","popularity":0.0744,"poster_path":"/602CfaE9YQTd39jIYcF9Qf3FEFO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":224085,"logo_path":"/ghTYXwPgKmnEUjFwDmCq0KZGcYj.png","name":"La
