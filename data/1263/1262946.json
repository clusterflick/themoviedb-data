Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world. In North America, a large number of converts are women. Many are drawn to the religion because of its emphasis on social justice and spiritual equality between the sexes. Yet, many mosques force women to pray behind barriers, separate from men, and some do not even permit women to enter the building. Exploring all sides of the issue, the film examines the space – both physical and social – granted to women in mosques across the country.","popularity":1.2076,"poster_path":"/2eaWpmQfcy5vWfvSUl3Yvmmu5YH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Me and the Mosque","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1234895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zarqa Nawaz","original_name":"Zarqa Nawaz","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"65fce1ddbe6d88017db1a508","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1234895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zarqa Nawaz","original_name":"Zarqa Nawaz","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fce1f20bc5290162aff1e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1234895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zarqa Nawaz","original_name":"Zarqa Nawaz","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fce1fe7f6c8d017c6e06ee","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3869407,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joe MacDonald","original_name":"Joe MacDonald","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fce22c60620a017c2898b6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2eaWpmQfcy5vWfvSUl3Yvmmu5YH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11001,"name":"religion"},{"id":194451,"name":"social issues"},{"id":298721,"name":"women"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"E","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
