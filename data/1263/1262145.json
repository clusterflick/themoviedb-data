They are the striking prologue to a disappointing film, which consists of the presentation of the characters of a story that is not told. The type of estrangement that the director seeks, to which is added the direct appeal to the public, is a questioning of the role that this type of spectacle assigns to the spectator, and of the conditions that make him distinguish cinema itself from advertising and allow him to enjoy detective narrative. The mockery, moreover, is directed equally at the consumer society and at the radicals who believe they can combat it with graffiti.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/hJzQjWDr1AsjLTazvKBoKAGLOYO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Matinée 3:15","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1802606,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Castillo","original_name":"Carlos Castillo","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/1ooKMEI8Vb7kthduVv3x4g95Io6.jpg","credit_id":"65faeea3770700014905e90c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hJzQjWDr1AsjLTazvKBoKAGLOYO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
