We at Amazing Schlock were fortunate enough to come into possession of that tape in 1998, and we made The Movie From the Future, a documentary about the \"space-tape\" and its amazing contents. The tape had apparently fallen back in time through a black hole, and on it was a movie called Daddy, I Love an Alien. The film is a fascinating look at species discrimination, robot civil rights, the war between humanity and various aliens, and, of course, love. The Movie From the Future consists of large clips of Daddy, I Love an Alien as well as informative interviews with the scientists who have made the study of the \"space-tape\" their life's work, as well as with those who believe that the film is a clever hoax perpetrated by desperate filmmakers. Is the film a hoax? If it's not, what can it teach us? Watch the film and decide for yourself.","popularity":0.2158,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15425,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amazing Schlock Film Factory","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Movie from the Future","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63453,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Patrick Casey","original_name":"Patrick Casey","popularity":0.6788,"profile_path":"/tAhWI0rojGBVf9ikPcCRCMRLzBu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Armand Johnson","credit_id":"65fca86c04733f014ae68856","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63449,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Josh Miller","original_name":"Josh Miller","popularity":0.431,"profile_path":"/m9dCtaDDXycswi47CP6WP0F7v1D.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mojo, Mojo 2","credit_id":"65fca87c3520e8017ed513ea","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63449,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Josh Miller","original_name":"Josh Miller","popularity":0.431,"profile_path":"/m9dCtaDDXycswi47CP6WP0F7v1D.jpg","credit_id":"65fca7a07f6c8d017c6d78d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63449,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Josh Miller","original_name":"Josh Miller","popularity":0.431,"profile_path":"/m9dCtaDDXycswi47CP6WP0F7v1D.jpg","credit_id":"65fca8910bc529017cb1100b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63453,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Patrick Casey","original_name":"Patrick Casey","popularity":0.6788,"profile_path":"/tAhWI0rojGBVf9ikPcCRCMRLzBu.jpg","credit_id":"65fca84a0929f60164992f4a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3545564,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sean Hall","original_name":"Sean Hall","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fca8b21b1f3c016395bcbd","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63453,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Patrick Casey","original_name":"Patrick Casey","popularity":0.6788,"profile_path":"/tAhWI0rojGBVf9ikPcCRCMRLzBu.jpg","credit_id":"65fca89c04733f017de928d6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63449,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Josh Miller","original_name":"Josh Miller","popularity":0.431,"profile_path":"/m9dCtaDDXycswi47CP6WP0F7v1D.jpg","credit_id":"65fca7e4770700016307b579","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0422773","wikidata_id":"Q7752562","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"(B-Movie Film Festival)","release_date":"2000-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"(Sub Rosa Studios)","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
