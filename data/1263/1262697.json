Jürg Neuenschwander's camera takes us into the hospital rooms, morgues and homes where life comes to pass. A young couple saying their last goodbyes to their newborn son or the teenager coming to terms with a fatal disease: the film accompanies those affected by death, and compares our western attitude to death with that in Tibetan culture. Final goodbyes from life are universally painful and difficult, and Neuenschwander's sensitive film subtly reminds us of our own mortality.","popularity":0.1105,"poster_path":"/4Bo9ap8m1KDM4NfhMfylhMpkgQi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20014,"logo_path":null,"name":"Carac Films","origin_country":""},{"id":134860,"logo_path":null,"name":"Container Film AG","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sooner or Later","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2414342,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jürg Neuenschwander","original_name":"Jürg Neuenschwander","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fc52aa0bc5290162af349c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2414342,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jürg Neuenschwander","original_name":"Jürg Neuenschwander","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fc52c70c1255017e0b01f1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4606608,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nicolas Broccard","original_name":"Nicolas Broccard","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fc52d50bc5290149ae4e3c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1741343,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Philippe Cordey","original_name":"Philippe Cordey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fc52f060620a014925ae09","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1143465,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Regina Bärtschi","original_name":"Regina Bärtschi","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fc52f70c1255014b0a0b42","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4606609,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Theres Scherer-Kollbrunner","original_name":"Theres Scherer-Kollbrunner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fc530f0c1255017e0b022b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0384710","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":898,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4Bo9ap8m1KDM4NfhMfylhMpkgQi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":634}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2003-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
