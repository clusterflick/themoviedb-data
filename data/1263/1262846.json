Thanks to them, a large number of wounded and lost animals are found during hunting season. They are an important resource for wildlife protection and management. This short film meets one of them, Yves Martineau, and follows the long waits and intense research that comes with the job. In the heart of the Canadian forest, on Matane’s wildlife reserve, we follow this man and his dogs through the vastness of the woods.","popularity":0.2892,"poster_path":"/3uLWCrBeMie0eS809VpixGSGBSu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":224186,"logo_path":null,"name":"Saint-Fortunat Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2024-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bloodhound Dog","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Bloodhound Dog","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4607972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yves Martineau","original_name":"Yves Martineau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Yves Martineau","credit_id":"65fce95304733f017de9d5f9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2565578,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Moulin","original_name":"Louis Moulin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/29Yx63pybiPmyDuDhyF9dhcGK3O.jpg","credit_id":"65fc9fea3520e8017ed50bf0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2565578,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Moulin","original_name":"Louis Moulin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/29Yx63pybiPmyDuDhyF9dhcGK3O.jpg","credit_id":"65fca00660620a016326bdc4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2565578,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Moulin","original_name":"Louis Moulin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/29Yx63pybiPmyDuDhyF9dhcGK3O.jpg","credit_id":"65fca00b04733f017de91e34","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3900902,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Philippe Jourdain","original_name":"Jean-Philippe Jourdain","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fce975be6d88014ab11726","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4607976,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Simard","original_name":"David Simard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fce98f0929f6016499744b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qcAGKlBHWvnn0fQwQF6aDE7B4Of.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2304,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3uLWCrBeMie0eS809VpixGSGBSu.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1728},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ytJ4jeMWZOpavVkbmSUsesFTxJO.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15162,"name":"dog"},{"id":33688,"name":"hunting"},{"id":158279,"name":"hunt"},{"id":189432,"name":"hunting dog"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
