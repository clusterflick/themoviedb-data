The film features extensive footage shot over six years with Snopek himself, along with original interviews with fellow musicians, fans, and industry insiders—including longtime Snopek collaborators and fellow Milwaukee eccentrics, the Violent Femmes. Through archival footage, live performances, and even a few glimpses into alternate realities, viewers will gain a newfound appreciation for Snopek’s restlessly innovative spirit and enduring legacy.","popularity":0.0802,"poster_path":"/7lwXzdcoxXpybi1XZCMYjJDoIk7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":390,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Complete History Of Space/Time (Destination Milwaukee)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3522389,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sigmund Snopeck III","original_name":"Sigmund Snopeck III","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65fc543960620a017c27745e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4733247,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valerie Reed","original_name":"Valerie Reed","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"665087a99f2c7164d885c9bf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4733249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meaghan Owens","original_name":"Meaghan Owens","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"665087b75d189ce4f1cb24d8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4733252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shaun Snopek","original_name":"Shaun Snopek","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"665087f4ed26e32ff73513ab","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4255690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rachel Kempf","original_name":"Rachel Kempf","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"narrator","credit_id":"6650887e4667440f89351032","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4606640,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bob Mielke","original_name":"Bob Mielke","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fc55120c1255017e0b042b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1378941,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nick Toti","original_name":"Nick Toti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660c830be039f10162e553d6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2222,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7lwXzdcoxXpybi1XZCMYjJDoIk7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
