It remained unfinished due to the death of Sergei Parajanov. The Confession (1990) was his favorite screenplay, which was written in the 1960s and was his film-memory of the childhood, student years, marriage, imprisonment and more as the fantasist Parajanov perceived it. Parajanov gifted the screenplay to Mikhail Vartanov, made a drawing on the cover and wrote: \"The Confession will only be made by a director born in 1924 in Tiflis, Georgia.\" He predicted that he would not finish it.","popularity":0.1448,"poster_path":"/5v92SzmodosuJVxAcTaPN9wjCQU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4484,"logo_path":"/qWC0eR60XPtyONfPQwVMKQ9pZS8.png","name":"Armenia Studio","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1990-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Confession","video":false,"vote_average":3.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","title":"აღიარება","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Раскаивание","type":"Alternative"},{"iso_3166_1":"AM","title":"Խոստովանություն","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":240837,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofiko Chiaureli","original_name":"სოფიკო ჭიაურელი","popularity":0.3066,"profile_path":"/kikSv9nmMHUHqUh3qg26JlkZTI0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"5c9f5f389251411a2505195e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1802653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuri Mgoyan","original_name":"Yuri Mgoyan","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/8UqkVaHYXRFW8JitcSH7Fzb1veD.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Relative","credit_id":"5c9f5f509251411a14051d1e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergei Parajanov","original_name":"Сергей Параджанов","popularity":0.5032,"profile_path":"/90Vpo4UtfYeckMRLesg9Fanqgcs.jpg","credit_id":"55d598b192514102c3003c2b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergei Parajanov","original_name":"Сергей Параджанов","popularity":0.5032,"profile_path":"/90Vpo4UtfYeckMRLesg9Fanqgcs.jpg","credit_id":"5c9f5cffc3a3687355814f1c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0325198","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5v92SzmodosuJVxAcTaPN9wjCQU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"was not completed","release_date":"1990-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
