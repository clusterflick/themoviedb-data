Like them, are we ignoring warnings of God’s coming judgment? The Bible gives us clear signs of the last days. Did you know the Scriptures say we will see:  Flippant use of God’s name  Money-hungry preachers and rampant hypocrisy in the church  Wars and rumors of wars  Denial of a global flood  But surely no educated person could believe that Noah and his ark ever really existed. Wouldn’t it be impossible to fit millions of species of animals into one boat? And what evidence is there (if any) for a worldwide catastrophic flood? However…what if it did all happen exactly as the Bible says? What would that mean? Who was Noah, and why is the amazing account of his life so relevant to you in the 21st century? Don’t be caught unaware. Time may be very short. Will you be ready?  A movie by Ray Comfort. This is not the Russell Crowe film.","popularity":0.1952,"poster_path":"/9XTYV65ALTcJ7hFwIfu0X56k7eE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61334,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trinity Broadcasting Network","origin_country":""},{"id":61333,"logo_path":null,"name":"Living Waters Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Noah and the Last Days","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Comfort","original_name":"Ray Comfort","popularity":0.1487,"profile_path":"/qdHm9GVoQc11MoR1lrMsqtGgR7f.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self - Narrator","credit_id":"679b0dd7365867535abd7800","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5212904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Collins","original_name":"Jeff Collins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self - Voice Over","credit_id":"679b0e0eb23629e7f8fbcc3b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1682814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevan Brighting","original_name":"Kevan Brighting","popularity":0.0613,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self - Voice Over","credit_id":"679b0e38b23629e7f8fbcc4d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1196174,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Emeal Zwayne","original_name":"Emeal Zwayne","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":"/rgYrIrlp1WndHOj8t8tu2fclKB9.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"679b0e4e125798ad4bbd7c03","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5212905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeffrey Kluger","original_name":"Jeffrey Kluger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"679b0e6a0902b69ec7fbc3a0","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Comfort","original_name":"Ray Comfort","popularity":0.1487,"profile_path":"/qdHm9GVoQc11MoR1lrMsqtGgR7f.jpg","credit_id":"679b0da3b23629e7f8fbcc23","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Comfort","original_name":"Ray Comfort","popularity":0.1487,"profile_path":"/qdHm9GVoQc11MoR1lrMsqtGgR7f.jpg","credit_id":"679b0daf4448da3d2abd7efe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Comfort","original_name":"Ray Comfort","popularity":0.1487,"profile_path":"/qdHm9GVoQc11MoR1lrMsqtGgR7f.jpg","credit_id":"679b0e84b23629e7f8fbcc64","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4502108,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Spence","original_name":"Mark Spence","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679b0ea8125798ad4bbd7c1e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4502108,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Spence","original_name":"Mark Spence","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679b0ec7365867535abd7831","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1490198,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eddie Roman","original_name":"Eddie Roman","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679b0ef7c35721885a344c55","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1490198,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eddie Roman","original_name":"Eddie Roman","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679b0f09ff8a9db5e5344f0c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3507142","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":2841,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9XTYV65ALTcJ7hFwIfu0X56k7eE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
