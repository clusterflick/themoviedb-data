Arlen played the title role, here assigned by the army to quell an Indian attack on the powerless settlers. The Indians are accusing Tom Russell (John Dexter) of murdering a member of the tribe, an act, as Buffalo Bill discovers, actually committed by a gang of outlaws hired by investment company owner J.B. Jordon (Frank O'Connor). Buffalo Bill Rides Again was soundly defeated by a low budget and slipshod direction by the veteran Bernard B. Ray. Popular B-Western villain Ted Adams disappeared mysteriously halfway through the film, only to be replaced by Edmund Cobb. Jennifer Holt, the daughter of Arlen contemporary Jack Holt and by far the busiest B-Western heroine of the 1940s, had little to do other than letting herself be kidnapped by evil Gil Patric.","popularity":0.499,"poster_path":"/g3SuEKiS1ilF4ci1b3hK2ZNvk5M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8481,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jack Schwarz Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1947-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"BUFFALO BILL ON THE LOOSE AGAIN - for LAW and ORDER","title":"Buffalo Bill Rides Again","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Arlen","original_name":"Richard Arlen","popularity":0.2788,"profile_path":"/dDr230NdMlxt4BC0OxwG0pJZV7t.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Buffalo Bill","credit_id":"55d4e121c3a368507000293d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Holt","original_name":"Jennifer Holt","popularity":0.2992,"profile_path":"/hj2maSjgsyEsJsP0gNSGGVo6D2y.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dale Harrington","credit_id":"55d4e12b92514102c80026bf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":951965,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Shumway","original_name":"Lee Shumway","popularity":0.1918,"profile_path":"/AnA5fg9fU5vqbYIauvkhHj6lGqh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Steve Harrington","credit_id":"55d4e136c3a3685abc000888","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1422444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gil Patric","original_name":"Gil Patric","popularity":0.0499,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"E.D.
