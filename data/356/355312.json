It was once the centre of Jewish culture in the Bukowina, a border area characterized over centuries by a multi-cultural mixture of peoples. Here, Ukrainians, Poles, Romanians, Germans and Jews lived side by side.\r Volker Koepp’s film focuses on Mr. Zwilling and Mrs. Zuckermann, two of the last few Jews born in the old Czernowitz. They share a friendship but also their love for the German language. Mr. Zwilling visits 90-year-old Mrs. Zuckermann daily in the early hours of the evening. They talk about old times, about shared events, about politics and literature and the worries of everyday life.","popularity":0.0814,"poster_path":"/ishACgVtDhoiyYKpGC8cdpT4yUm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1999-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Yiddish","iso_639_1":"yi","name":""},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Herr Zwilling und Frau Zuckermann","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1047379,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Volker Koepp","original_name":"Volker Koepp","popularity":0.0801,"profile_path":"/f3Yb6zVCMsjIhncmcd10a9LvFdm.jpg","credit_id":"5814f3e4c3a36874b7002169","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1047379,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Volker Koepp","original_name":"Volker Koepp","popularity":0.0801,"profile_path":"/f3Yb6zVCMsjIhncmcd10a9LvFdm.jpg","credit_id":"5814f3d3c3a368766900250a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1798441,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Angelika Arnold","original_name":"Angelika Arnold","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59393d48c3a368785a01074f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38196,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Thomas Plenert","original_name":"Thomas Plenert","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59393d3dc3a368785a010742","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1830417,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Barbara Frankenstein","original_name":"Barbara Frankenstein","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59393d3292514108800109fa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0202390","wikidata_id":"Q2520156","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/ishACgVtDhoiyYKpGC8cdpT4yUm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"Berlin International Film Festival","release_date":"1999-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
