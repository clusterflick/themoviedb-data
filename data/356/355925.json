In the fall of 2011 hundreds of people did just that as a public protest against corporate greed and with the hope of creating an alternative society. Occupy Wall Street started as an under attended protest that quickly caught fire and capturing international headlines, the imaginations and hearts of people across the globe. Almost overnight the movement transformed the national dialog about economic inequality and corporate corruption. The slogan 'We are the 99 percent' instantly became part of the national lexicon. This documentary is an intimate portrait of several key players who helped create the movement and their wild ride through the rise and fall of Occupy Wall Street.","popularity":0.3624,"poster_path":"/AhECCrNokM3SJHzpIwpV16BZIV2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7407,"logo_path":"/6uSTdFHCifrdG43w2xy6Aog9QpT.png","name":"Insurgent Docs","origin_country":"US"},{"id":61619,"logo_path":null,"name":"Article 19 Films","origin_country":""},{"id":4183,"logo_path":"/bPOaJehJ43bEq1sip5jE1G53IEE.png","name":"Diamond Docs","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Another World","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26473,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fisher Stevens","original_name":"Fisher Stevens","popularity":1.5193,"profile_path":"/vfyZMT3t3mGTloYGrC7T3QhGkwp.jpg","credit_id":"55da394a925141721d004502","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94816,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Monroe","original_name":"Mark Monroe","popularity":0.0971,"profile_path":"/pNqFadHJzvaTrfY1iiuYR31v4Sw.jpg","credit_id":"55da3abe92514143e4005b9d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":585010,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rebecca Chaiklin","original_name":"Rebecca Chaiklin","popularity":0.0913,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55da39d492514143de005d53","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3500888","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AhECCrNokM3SJHzpIwpV16BZIV2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
