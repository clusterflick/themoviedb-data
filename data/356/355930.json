His talents and devotion are envied by all. One evening, following a self-imposed fast, Haim-Aaron collapses and loses consciousness. The paramedics announce his death, but his father takes over resuscitation efforts and, beyond all expectations, Haim-Aaron comes back to life. After the accident, try as he might, Haim-Aaron remains apathetic to his studies. He feels overwhelmed by a sudden awakening of his body and suspects this is God testing him. He wonders if he should stray from the prescribed path and find a way to rekindle his faith...  The title means \"Rectify\" in Hebrew; nevertheless the movie is called Tikkun in the English-speaking world.","popularity":0.5486,"poster_path":"/dhAcVYLsIFPcMUhRQs7HKPhaSU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62485,"logo_path":null,"name":"Plan B
