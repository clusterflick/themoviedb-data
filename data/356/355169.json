In this first part of a trilogy, realities continue to shift between the story, and the actual making of the film, as seen through unscripted scenes, real-life narrations by lead actors, and the real relationship that developed on the set between Richardson and the actress (Carolyn Zaremba) who played his girlfriend. A bumbling, local librarian (played by Ed Nylund) is mistaken for the \"killer\" and plays along with the game.","popularity":0.1675,"poster_path":"/lI07Q6HXQviCUKIA8EIqsASzevQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1975-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Man, a Woman and a Killer","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2385755,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Nylund","original_name":"Ed Nylund","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Ed","credit_id":"5d691c35fe077a001199a27b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2385754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carolyn Zaremba","original_name":"Carolyn Zaremba","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"'Z'","credit_id":"5d691c69ca83543759f667ee","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2385756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Richardson","original_name":"Dick Richardson","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Dick","credit_id":"5d691c706f43ec001273ebe5","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wayne Wang","original_name":"Wayne Wang","popularity":0.2258,"profile_path":"/wtw5Cg8dWy9N7Fvn9SWvboibWek.jpg","credit_id":"55d3b973c3a36850720000c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1498108,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rick Schmidt","original_name":"Rick Schmidt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/daOMD2Kbjtjhxwglz0QJcfpP9XU.jpg","credit_id":"55d3b989c3a36850760000df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1498108,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rick Schmidt","original_name":"Rick Schmidt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/daOMD2Kbjtjhxwglz0QJcfpP9XU.jpg","credit_id":"5ee23b7590dde00021aabae8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1498108,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rick Schmidt","original_name":"Rick Schmidt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/daOMD2Kbjtjhxwglz0QJcfpP9XU.jpg","credit_id":"5ee23b6959008600204e4271","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2385756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Richardson","original_name":"Dick Richardson","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee23b854c1bb0001ea573a8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1498108,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rick Schmidt","original_name":"Rick Schmidt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/daOMD2Kbjtjhxwglz0QJcfpP9XU.jpg","credit_id":"5ee23b6ff36a32001f922ee4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1498108,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rick Schmidt","original_name":"Rick Schmidt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/daOMD2Kbjtjhxwglz0QJcfpP9XU.jpg","credit_id":"5ee23b7ef36a32001d941240","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wayne Wang","original_name":"Wayne Wang","popularity":0.2258,"profile_path":"/wtw5Cg8dWy9N7Fvn9SWvboibWek.jpg","credit_id":"5ee23b584c1bb0001ea57323","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0073348","wikidata_id":"Q47063947","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.663,"height":806,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lI07Q6HXQviCUKIA8EIqsASzevQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":534}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
