Cast as a troubleshooter for the U.S. Land Office, Dean is assigned to settle a deadly range war. Sure enough, the warring homesteaders and cattlemen are being whipped into a frenzy by a third party, who hopes to \"divide and conquer,\" claiming the land for himself. Surprisingly, all-purpose PRC villain George Cheseboro isn't the culprit in this one; instead, he's cast as the father of heroine Jennifer Holt. Roscoe Ates is once more on hand for some questionable comedy relief.","popularity":1.1504,"poster_path":"/oC7uS3bnbZCWWONhxUm8RyzbZnn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16466,"logo_path":"/4MT9eqAB0bHzhaFVVniMaxlJ5xS.png","name":"PRC","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1948-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"COVERED WAGON TRAINS BATTLE OUTLAWS!","title":"Tornado Range","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":975675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Dean","original_name":"Eddie Dean","popularity":0.2209,"profile_path":"/fboC8VWbT0cMoMA27pDfsyhog9Y.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Eddie Dean","credit_id":"55d33aa7c3a368464c00149f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roscoe Ates","original_name":"Roscoe Ates","popularity":0.1915,"profile_path":"/jrtu4ej5MLP6Ynl35wPP0bGaroB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Soapy Jones","credit_id":"55d33ab092514170b30013ee","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Holt","original_name":"Jennifer Holt","popularity":0.2992,"profile_path":"/hj2maSjgsyEsJsP0gNSGGVo6D2y.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mary King","credit_id":"55d33abd92514170b1001543","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Chesebro","original_name":"George Chesebro","popularity":0.1764,"profile_path":"/s8A5WerpnAjIom4ezjiTEcDEOc4.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lance King","credit_id":"55d33ac792514170bf001336","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1422446,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Buster Slaven","original_name":"Buster Slaven","popularity":0.1009,"profile_path":"/lrmAXablYi5KsDszBx3mJPjk7Zm.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jebby Sawyer (as Brad Slaven)","credit_id":"55d33ad3c3a368464c0014a5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marshall Reed","original_name":"Marshall Reed","popularity":0.2182,"profile_path":"/kMniZFRQRqC1znX5sH9SdjUr2Yy.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Sam Wilson","credit_id":"55d33adfc3a368464c0014a8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terry Frost","original_name":"Terry Frost","popularity":0.2672,"profile_path":"/ySuSRt41JsrcV4yQ3KGKNF24yo5.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Thayer","credit_id":"57559f499251417e6f000092","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":160930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lane Bradford","original_name":"Lane Bradford","popularity":0.4625,"profile_path":"/mRn7rr4JK2AuLeQrau6vVmjYJcN.jpg","cast_id":21,"character":"Henchman Thorne","credit_id":"57559f52c3a3687afa000092","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":136894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russell Arms","original_name":"Russell Arms","popularity":0.1188,"profile_path":"/wKiLVOnw3VAYlO54T3MmjlNc97a.jpg","cast_id":22,"character":"Killer Dorgan aka Ben Colton","credit_id":"57559f5ac3a3687aee00009b","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Clark","original_name":"Steve Clark","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":"/a0lfrbHO67CKwj7JGk0zYw23nqV.jpg","cast_id":23,"character":"Pop Sawyer","credit_id":"57559f649251417e79000080","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1631512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Parker","original_name":"Andy Parker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":24,"character":"Musician (Leader of The Plainsmen)","credit_id":"57559f789251417e8200008c","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33377,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ray Taylor","original_name":"Ray Taylor","popularity":0.2514,"profile_path":"/6BWjMjBsN22WHVcoilfwiZQW7W5.jpg","credit_id":"55d33a93c3a36846380014bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":195914,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William Lively","original_name":"William Lively","popularity":0.0867,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57559cd5c3a3687aee000026","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":161800,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jerry Thomas","original_name":"Jerry Thomas","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57559cde9251417e73000028","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34802,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"James S.
