The rise to power of the film's namesake appears as the inevitable outcome of a dialectical logical. Or so the voice-over might lead one to believe. If the usual practice of détourned films is for the soundtrack to undermine the image, here the reverse occasionally takes place. The images critique Mao's words. They show that which, even in the official visual record of the times, the narrative elides.  The film is dedicated to Li Yhi Zhe, the nominal author of a famous Democracy Wall critique of the Maoist state.","popularity":0.126,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":61405,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films des Iles","origin_country":""},{"id":16180,"logo_path":"/tE5t6MnMhvyc34beR4Qf6hM2c5K.png","name":"INA","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1977-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mao by Mao","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1001615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mao Zedong","original_name":"Mao Zedong","popularity":0.1819,"profile_path":"/nuQSpbdD2i4jvBDB0TnvoVbD493.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5801a504c3a368312b00244b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1283314,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"René Viénet","original_name":"René Viénet","popularity":0.0667,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55d72d13c3a36843680023d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498944,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wu Xing-ming","original_name":"Wu Xing-ming","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55d72d2792514166fe00269b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498945,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francis Deron","original_name":"Francis Deron","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55d72d3f925141670c002308","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":51835,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Helène Vager","original_name":"Helène Vager","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e55c0cdb8a000069383cc8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2772762,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charles-Henri Favrod","original_name":"Charles-Henri Favrod","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61e55c1ab7abb5001a21c760","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0263713","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
