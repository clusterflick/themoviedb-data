It also addresses the role of electronic media in the struggle for power, and more broadly, American intervention in the Third World.  Using a structure that emulates the way television news programs construct meaning through fragmentation, the tape interweaves clips of Filipino activists and reporters, a fictional television anchorwoman and correspondent, commentary by independent filmmaker Trinh T. Minh-ha, Fagin's off-camera voice and script, and anonymous excerpts from commercial television.","popularity":0.1185,"poster_path":"/4BZxiT9HFiaqL7rDxXIKDaTt203.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Machine That Killed Bad People","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498528,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Fagin","original_name":"Steve Fagin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"587fd14c92514107db004dcb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1104893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Trịnh T.
