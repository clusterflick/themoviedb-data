It moves through a circle of five interlocking episodes that describe the phenomenon of interruption in contemporary communication through various forms and modes, investigating causes, consequences, and side-effects. Genres shift along the episodic path of this circle, moving from documentary to essay, through collage, simulated live-coverage, and silent film. As the phenomenon of interruption is seen to be a pervasive part of these genres, the film attends to the act of watching moving images. At the center of the film is a documentary segment on the origin of the biggest upheaval in communication history: the invention of the telephone, initiated by the \"man who contracted space,\" Alexander Graham Bell.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/kahIoO3yOZyPckn3jhsUZrGVZH1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Circle's Short Circuit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1498543,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caspar Stracke","original_name":"Caspar Stracke","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55d59c10c3a3684d9e001608","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0910853","wikidata_id":"Q28941911","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kahIoO3yOZyPckn3jhsUZrGVZH1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
