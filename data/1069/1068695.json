In the ’80s, Gordon and her bandmates were fixtures of New York’s downtown art and music scene; one regular haunt of theirs was legendary nightclub Danceteria, which served as the setting for a short film Gordon made sometime around 1985. Now, as Dangerous Minds points out, said video has surfaced online thanks to filmmaker/designer Chris Habib (a.k.a. Visitor Design). “Excellent video I found in my Sonic Youth archive,” Habib writes on the clip’s Vimeo page. “I digitized it for Kim during her [early 2000s] CLUB IN THE SHADOWS exhibition at Kenny Schachter’s old space in the West Village.”","popularity":0.395,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":189524,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rough Cut Productions","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Making the Nature Scene","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3854400,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roli Mosimann","original_name":"Roli Mosimann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b23d83a9117f0565662df9","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3854403,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alexa Hill","original_name":"Alexa Hill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b23da4875d1a00e274f54c","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2192336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wharton Tiers","original_name":"Wharton Tiers","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b23dc957530e00e184792a","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3854407,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chasler","original_name":"Chasler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b23dde875d1a008a4b741f","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3854397,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Judith Barry","original_name":"Judith Barry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b23d65663627008ac440ca","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1604354,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Oursler","original_name":"Tony Oursler","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":"/lcn8zD8Z6rSYQ8Owo6IYvZWvWuV.jpg","credit_id":"63b23e08875d1a008a4b743c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":18517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Gordon","original_name":"Kim Gordon","popularity":0.3585,"profile_path":"/QxhtVBFDKFVn6loMj9a1AqNmUv.jpg","credit_id":"63b23d43663627008ac440af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":155865,"name":"club scene"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"MAKING THE NATURE SCENE BY KIM GORDON","key":"68189518","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2013-06-12T03:12:43.000Z","id":"63b23f3aa9117f058bc3e0ed"}]}}}
