The video unveils a contin- uous editing process that gives cohesion to a series of apparently uncon- nected and fragmented images. In the artist's words, \"It's an ode to the disillusionment of the 90s, to the disorientation caused by excessive tele- vision consumption that gave us the false illusion of a promising future that would never come\".
