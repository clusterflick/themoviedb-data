His intention to marry the dancer costs him his wealth and drives him into poverty. He ends up hanging himself. This incites the hatred of the villagers against the voodoo shaman and they decide to chase away all shamans. But a Muslim minister (Ustad), Sutar, prevents them from doing so. Soon, the village is gripped by a series of killings of those considered to be voodoo shamans. They start suspecting the religious figures (Kiai) but the murders are committed by several men in black, with their faces covered like ninjas. The minister is also threatened by anonymous phone calls and is even attacked. Then the authorities release a statement that there are no ninjas. The murders remain a mystery. Symbolically, it ends with a little boy carrying the national flag with his friends.","popularity":0.0925,"poster_path":"/uzzJNKYaLgG2nLjt9f99skT5t4G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42838,"logo_path":null,"name":"PT Andalas Kencana Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Banyuwangi Mystery (Shaman Wizard)","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3852922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anton Yanuar","original_name":"Anton Yanuar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Ustad Sutar","credit_id":"63b0cbe91d1bf400d3797da6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3852923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arif Terikasan","original_name":"Arif Terikasan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ratmono","credit_id":"63b0cc1a5ad76b0085e649fa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3852924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erni Melati","original_name":"Erni Melati","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"63b0cc531d1bf400d3797dc0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2036530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rengga Takengon","original_name":"Rengga Takengon","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"63b0cd841d1bf4007dbc6a27","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3852926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yunus Takara","original_name":"Yunus Takara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"63b0cda6c56d2d0096d3ee41","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3852945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dino","original_name":"Dino","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"63b0d10026677800b83f8a5e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1689550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Suwandi","original_name":"Grace Suwandi","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"63b0d10e2667780084fe3f3f","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2461066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walmer Sitohang","original_name":"Walmer Sitohang","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b0c5d2875d1a007d6e42e6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1518717,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Madhu S Mahtani","original_name":"Madhu S Mahtani","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b0c60b1d1bf40082886810","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3852927,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Yoke Mariana","original_name":"Yoke Mariana","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b0ce7f1d1bf4008adf7865","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3852933,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"William Samara","original_name":"William Samara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b0cf0357530e0085017e89","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2461066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walmer Sitohang","original_name":"Walmer Sitohang","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b0cfc87ef3811fab64d18e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3244847,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Musya Joenoes","original_name":"Musya Joenoes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b0d00f5ad76b0094c7fa99","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2531696,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Suparman Sidik","original_name":"Suparman Sidik","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b0d04726677800b83f897c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2270474,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Aman Supriyatna","original_name":"Aman Supriyatna","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b0d0a42667780084fe3ec8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uzzJNKYaLgG2nLjt9f99skT5t4G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
