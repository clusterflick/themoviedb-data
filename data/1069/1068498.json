The story unfolds through a chain of abstract imagery and metaphors.  An old queen is trapped within the rocks, alongside a woman in black and a white angel, who, like a young girl, governs the red thread of fate. Is the woman in black the queen’s alter ego, her daughter, or her past self? She finds herself drawn to a man playing the violin in a café.","popularity":0.1057,"poster_path":"/r5sBwtwL5rldsmFdJ5xyOmPK2Hl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2006-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Old Salmon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Old Salmon: Umi o mitsumete sugita jikan","type":"romanization"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1050795,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Takeo Kimura","original_name":"木村威夫","popularity":0.2903,"profile_path":"/rcSt4j460YuYtcEjoQleCCRxpGx.jpg","credit_id":"63b1b586875d1a008a4b4d39","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1636846,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jun Kawabata","original_name":"Jun Kawabata","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b1b58f1d1bf4008adfdbc9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1050795,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Takeo Kimura","original_name":"木村威夫","popularity":0.2903,"profile_path":"/rcSt4j460YuYtcEjoQleCCRxpGx.jpg","credit_id":"63b1b5985ad76b0094c85946","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":958008,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Norifumi Ataka","original_name":"安宅紀史","popularity":0.1451,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b1b5a07ef3811f58cb49cd","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1332670,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kazuhiro Shirao","original_name":"Kazuhiro Shirao","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b1b5a757530e008014d5ee","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1332670,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kazuhiro Shirao","original_name":"Kazuhiro Shirao","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b1b5ab57530e008014d5f2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1636846,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jun Kawabata","original_name":"Jun Kawabata","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b1b5b61d1bf4008adfdbd7","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1860121,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Noboru Miyashita","original_name":"宮下昇","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b1b5be875d1a008a4b4d4d","department":"Lighting","job":"Gaffer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r5sBwtwL5rldsmFdJ5xyOmPK2Hl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":696}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"OLD SALMON 海をみつめて 過ぎた時間 予告編","key":"StGV5-v_9no","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2006-07-06T02:33:49.000Z","id":"63b1b76a57530e008dcb57f4"}]}}}
