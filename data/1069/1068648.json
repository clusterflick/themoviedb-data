She has piloted dance classes for schoolchildren across the country and spoken in Parliament calling for dance to be a key part of the curriculum to help children's fitness. She is aware that tackling our mental health crisis is an important challenge that affects many in the UK today and strongly believes that the value of dancing is undervalued in improving our mental health. So in this programme, Darcey's mission is to meet a wide range of people using dance as therapy and as a result experiencing the joy of 'dancing to happiness'.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/sfFhHIgMLdZILXi9e6l86byaKWp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76060,"logo_path":null,"name":"Matchlight","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Darcey Bussell: Dancing to Happiness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1225306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darcey Bussell","original_name":"Darcey Bussell","popularity":0.1881,"profile_path":"/vJUwc6xg5iyObuezVO9NsvhSXer.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63b21b77875d1a00bdde69db","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3701370,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pamela Gordon","original_name":"Pamela Gordon","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/sj8401QnkdwARKavv3vVM0Ps1rK.jpg","credit_id":"63b21bd86636270082210904","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1945840,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ross Wilson","original_name":"Ross Wilson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b21c4157530e00a359b027","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3854228,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jonathan Skuse","original_name":"Jonathan Skuse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b21c5e66362700b62487a3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3369720,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ian Garvin","original_name":"Ian Garvin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b21bee6636270082210916","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":1134,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sfFhHIgMLdZILXi9e6l86byaKWp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
