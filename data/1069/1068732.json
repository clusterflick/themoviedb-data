Kent settles on a remote island, isolated and free to do his work. He befriends an old prospector whose stories energize his pursuit. As he struggles with internal turmoil, his son’s innocence and willingness to face failure inspire Kent to dig deep inside himself and begin again.  Father and son’s connection blossoms as they embrace the wilderness experience together. Surrounded by the quiet magnificence of Fox Island, Kent creates the drawings and paintings that will catapult his career to national success and turn his dream into reality.","popularity":0.1025,"poster_path":"/yHhpFIm3SYkJlOdvjwIakZZMwbS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":189532,"logo_path":null,"name":"Downstream Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"THE QUIETEST PLACES SPEAK THE LOUDEST","title":"A Dreamer's Search","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3854691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven B Hill","original_name":"Steven B Hill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Lars Olson","credit_id":"64da7539bf31f201cb6bb440","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3854692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iver Mitchell","original_name":"Iver Mitchell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"Rockie Kent","credit_id":"64da7544001bbd00add41e57","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1849613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bradford James Jackson","original_name":"Bradford James Jackson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"Rockwell Kent","credit_id":"64da75b237109700ac427406","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1849613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bradford James Jackson","original_name":"Bradford James Jackson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64da75c3bf31f201ccc02055","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3854693,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eric Downs","original_name":"Eric Downs","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b291e90d417e008ac7114b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3854693,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eric Downs","original_name":"Eric Downs","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b291ffc56d2d00d8439d43","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3854695,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Kendall","original_name":"John Kendall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b2925b57530e00e184a03b","department":"Directing","job":"First Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3854697,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eric Downs","original_name":"Eric Downs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b2927f5ad76b007dc865b8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3854695,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Kendall","original_name":"John Kendall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b292ab5ad76b00cf4304d0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3854698,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Quinton Oliver Smith","original_name":"Quinton Oliver Smith","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b292d0c56d2d00f30fe873","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3854699,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nik Sharshak","original_name":"Nik Sharshak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b293061d1bf400d37a3309","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3173446,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Jessica Marie Cole","original_name":"Jessica Marie Cole","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b293161d1bf4008289220d","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3854700,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Kendall","original_name":"James Kendall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b293380d417e00821c0c78","department":"Directing","job":"Second Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1034515,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jeffery Alan Jones","original_name":"Jeffery Alan Jones","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b2935a0d417e00cf28f5ff","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1849611,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dean Q.
