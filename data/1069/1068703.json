At fifty, he has become an emblematic figure for a new generation of filmmakers. Even today, he is still in full rebellion against age and invests in short films and first films of young directors with an enthusiasm still intact. Through the testimonies of his first partners, filmmakers of several generations, relatives and fans, this documentary sketches the portrait of a committed man, an actor unknown to the general public, an icon for film lovers.","popularity":0.216,"poster_path":"/51hU5XtkT3pn5Oy1ID2SBHOLUBG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85467,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Tamarin","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2005-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Philippe Nahon, de l'acteur fétiche à l'icône","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Nahon","original_name":"Philippe Nahon","popularity":0.3554,"profile_path":"/CHlLvN1GCXb78eB418z9yfhrSu.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63b24d9e57530e00a359ca7f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Pierre Kalfon","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Kalfon","popularity":0.294,"profile_path":"/r55H3IrpdYD8Dq04PpboZCmmiPB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"63b24da7875d1a00e274fb01","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3854468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Noël Betzler","original_name":"Jean-Noël Betzler","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63b24db25ad76b0085e6de6e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent Cassel","original_name":"Vincent Cassel","popularity":3.5934,"profile_path":"/KxzpJXyzVnqfouInWLypAND0gL.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63b24dbaa9117f0565663480","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":132019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arnaud Cafaxe","original_name":"Arnaud Cafaxe","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b24d78875d1a008202705c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0466569","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/51hU5XtkT3pn5Oy1ID2SBHOLUBG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
