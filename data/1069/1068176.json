In the film, Miguel Calderón follows the weights of Chameleon for 24 hours, a falconer who works at night as a bouncer in a bar in the south of Mexico City, and who by day goes hunting his falcon every night, with whom he has developed a relationship. Emotional bond is his closest bond with a reality far removed from the situations of extreme violence to which he has been exposed since childhood.","popularity":0.0934,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Camaleón","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1105837,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Miguel Calderón","original_name":"Miguel Calderón","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b087bd5ad76b007dc79182","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
