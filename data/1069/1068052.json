Yet as circumstances demand it, she’s not your ordinary mother, nor a long-suffering widow for that matter. Her missions? To pull her son out of peril while standing up to bullies and saving homes from being uprooted and demolished in the name of urban renewal. Mrs. Pong effortlessly transforms from an armchair survivalist to a fearless heroine hell-bent on her mission, trading punches and kicks for frying pans and woks, awakening a rebellious spirit that wars against exploitation and oppression in a system tilted towards the rich and powerful.","popularity":0.0913,"poster_path":"/boGqWnNVkFWDXQCat4pH0PTUjHJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2013-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mrs. Pong","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1809911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neo Yau","original_name":"Neo Yau","popularity":0.2007,"profile_path":"/uoyHHtSNdoxMxsb507OMniYKN8e.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"63b0346357530e00850144f8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3852279,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ho Fung-lun","original_name":"Ho Fung-lun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b0359bc56d2d00d842ace6","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3639307,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ho Cheuk-Tin","original_name":"何爵天","popularity":0.0995,"profile_path":"/2AkX0grQZihXnEt7O8rqM6q8WoG.jpg","credit_id":"63b034561d1bf400a02dda36","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/boGqWnNVkFWDXQCat4pH0PTUjHJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Fresh Wave International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2013-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
