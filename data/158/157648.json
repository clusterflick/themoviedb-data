The traditional man-machine distinction becomes reduced to \"eye/machine\"\" where cameras are implanted into the machines as eyes.  As a result of the Gulf War, the technology of warfare came to provide an innovative impulse, which boosted the development of civilian production. Farocki shows us computer simulated images looking like something out of science-fiction films: rockets steer towards islands set in a shining sea; apartment blocks are blown up; fighter aircraft fire at one another with rockets and defend themselves with virtual flares.","popularity":0.0777,"poster_path":"/dqvyUfIqBP8rbtOSnxx5X8vvf1W.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eye / Machine II","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2333,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harun Farocki","original_name":"Harun Farocki","popularity":0.1326,"profile_path":"/qTMJH2Vq91rbsAGrk6AbsKeBnHY.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4bcc9251416c910e5ff1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2333,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harun Farocki","original_name":"Harun Farocki","popularity":0.1326,"profile_path":"/qTMJH2Vq91rbsAGrk6AbsKeBnHY.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4bcc9251416c910e5ff7","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0417449","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/dqvyUfIqBP8rbtOSnxx5X8vvf1W.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/lxdWFwoisqqSlWVYcTCoudn63na.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
