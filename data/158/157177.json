Martin and Osa Johnson began in Kenya and Tanzania before moving to Uganda and the Congo Basin (Zaire). Along the way they filmed Zebra in the Serengeti, charging Rhinos in the Northern Frontier District  (Southern Somalia), and recorded exciting encounters with Crocodiles and Hippos as they went down the Nile. The latter part of the film is devoted to the 7 months the filmmakers spent in the Ituri Forest with the Mbuti people as they captured village life despite the humidity, which caused batteries to deteriorate, wires and connections to erode, and mildew to form on camera cases.","popularity":0.1759,"poster_path":"/7Vjj4UA83avXueobCUMdMjov7vS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1932-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Tearing Through the Barriers of an Empire of Death","title":"Congorilla","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Congorila","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Adventures Among the Big Apes and Little People of Central Africa","type":"subtitle"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1169036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin E.
