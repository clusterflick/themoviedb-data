The scene eventually begins to warp and disintegrate. The result is equal parts mind-numbing and hypnotic.","popularity":0.0702,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1969-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Runaway","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1051411,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Standish Lawder","original_name":"Standish Lawder","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/7utGj4rUfz6PsRLBHoyloNeGBzg.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4bb49251416c910e30a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0347910","wikidata_id":"Q122661788","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
