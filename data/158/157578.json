Early in the film, Charles Bukowski talks about the energy of poets and of a poem. These poets are the children of Walt Whitman and of Charles Olson, incantatory and oratorical, radical, sometimes incorporating contemporary political imagery. Black Mountain poets, the Beats, minimalists like John Cage, the wordless Four Horsemen, Tom Waits, and others capture aspects of poets as troubadours.","popularity":0.9712,"poster_path":"/c3q4VXYKYc055N68qCwrrriwlOD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1982-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poetry in Motion","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67562,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Charles Bukowski","original_name":"Charles Bukowski","popularity":0.2255,"profile_path":"/jHKXGjR60oYp5k0hNiU10VNQg6P.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c2e2a230e0a260fc13984f3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6471,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William S.
