But the makers also pointed out that Caesar \"is the most intelligent dog actor since Rin-Tin-Tin\" which probably lured a few Rin-Tin-Tin fans with a show-me attitude. Caesar prowls around the woods of the Northwest, dispatches a rattlesnake, visits his she-wolf mate and their pups, pauses to watch the dainty habits of a raccoon personally washing every morsel of food before eating it---and that raccoon had enough food to use up several minutes of running time---and then saves sheepherder Pierre (Francis McDonald)) from getting eaten by one mean mountain lion. Rin-Tin-Tin he ain't, but then who was?","popularity":0.5887,"poster_path":"/gFQMGs7VMssf1jegvbTHdjIgdbL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17456,"logo_path":null,"name":"B.F.
