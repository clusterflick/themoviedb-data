There is no specific plot. One of the boys uses a pencil to create a myriad number of animated illusions that could only work in a cartoon. For example, a short vertical line is drawn, which when held by both ends suddenly becomes a saxophone. When played, the notes pop out of the bell of the instrument to suddenly grow legs and transform into ducks. After the song, the saxophone itself quickly follows suit and becomes a goose. The entire short consists of these disjointed, though often creative and humorously unlikely events.","popularity":0.1023,"poster_path":"/cDNmd4awtrmbJp9C7p8sVJBu1cI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7515,"logo_path":null,"name":"Van Beuren Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1932-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pencil Mania","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148258,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vernon Stallings","original_name":"Vernon Stallings","popularity":0.0984,"profile_path":"/uiho47tq19hRJemmfXDxzL4GoEp.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4bc79251416c910e55c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151996,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Foster","original_name":"John Foster","popularity":0.0856,"profile_path":"/k6IX2V57VJ7kZGUdxlzvnbe0njF.jpg","credit_id":"57c2f8a7c3a3684656006950","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0151935","wikidata_id":"Q7162322","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cDNmd4awtrmbJp9C7p8sVJBu1cI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1932-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
